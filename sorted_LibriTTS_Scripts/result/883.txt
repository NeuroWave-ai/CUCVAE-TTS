none	none	 ON THE LOOK OUT In these times of ours though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance with two figures in it floated on the Thames between Southwark bridge which is of iron and London Bridge which is of stone as an autumn evening was closing in The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun browned face and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter The girl rowed pulling a pair of sculls very easily the man with the rudder lines slack in his hands and his hands loose in his waistband kept an eager look out He had no net hook or line and he could not be a fisherman his boat had no cushion for a sitter no paint no inscription no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope and he could not be a waterman his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery and he could not be a lighterman or river carrier there was no clue to what he looked for 
501_125128_000154_000004	train-clean-360	but 
none	none	he looked for something with a most intent and searching gaze The tide which had turned an hour before was running down and his e
501_125128_000007_000002	train-clean-360	yes 
none	none	watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep as the boat made slight head way against it or drove stern foremost before it according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river But in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered and its sodden state this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did and were seeking what they often sought Half savage as the man showed with no covering on his matted head with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat still there was a business like usage in his steady gaze So with every lithe action of the girl with every turn of her wrist perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror they were things of usage Keep her out Lizzie Tide runs strong here Keep her

none	none	afore the sweep of it Trusting to the girl s skill and making no use of the rudder he eyed the coming tide with an absorbed attention So the girl eyed him But it happened now that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the bottom of the boat and touching a rotten stain there which bore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form coloured it as though with diluted blood This caught the girl s eye and she shivered What ails you said the man immediately aware of it though so intent on the advancing waters I see nothing afloat The red light was gone the shudder was gone and his gaze which had
501_125127_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 come 
none	none	back to the boat for a moment travelled away again Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment his gaze paused for an instant At every mooring chain and rope at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a broad arrowhead at the offsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves his shining eyes darted a hungry look After a darkening hour or so suddenly the rudder lines tightened in his hold and he steered hard towards the Surrey shore Always watching his face the girl instantly answered to the action in her sculling presently the boat swung round quivered as from a sudden jerk and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore over her head and over her face and looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were turned down the river kept the boat in that direction going before the tide Until now the boat had barely held her own and had hovered about one spot but now the banks changed swiftly and the deepening shadows and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand It was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the boat His arms were wet and dirty and he washed them over the side In his right hand he held something and he washed that in the river too It was money He chinked it once and he blew upon it once and he spat upon it once for luck he hoarsely said before he put it in his pocket Lizzie The girl turned her face towards him with a start and rowed in silence Her face was very pale He was a hook nosed man and with that and his bright eyes and his ruffled head bore a certain likeness to a roused bird of prey Take that thing off your face She put it back Here and give me hold of the sculls I ll take the rest of the spell No no

none	none	No I can t indeed Father I cannot sit so near it He was moving towards her to change places but her terrified expostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat What hurt can it do you None none But I cannot bear it It s my belief you hate the sight of the very river I I do not like it father As if it wasn t your living As if it wasn t meat and drink to you At these latter words the girl shivered again and for a moment paused in her rowing seeming to turn deadly faint It escaped his attention for he was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow How can you be so thankless to your best friend Lizzie The very fire that warmed you when you were a babby was picked out of the river alongside the coal barges The very basket that you slept in the tide washed ashore The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of it I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another Lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held and touched her lips with it and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him then without speaking she resumed her rowing as another boat of similar appearance though in rather better trim came out from a dark place and dropped softly alongside In luck again Gaffer said a man with a squinting leer who sculled her and who was alone I know d you was in luck again by your wake as you come down

none	none	I didn t touch him This was in answer to a quick impatient movement on the part of Gaffer the speaker at the same time unshipping his scull on that side and laying his hand on the gunwale of Gaffer s boat and holding to it He s had touches enough not to want no more as well as I make him out Gaffer Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides ain t he pardner Such is my out of luck ways you see He must have passed me when he went up last time for I was on the lookout below bridge here I a most think you re like the wulturs pardner and scent em out He spoke in a dropped voice and with more than one glance at Lizzie who had pulled on her hood again Both men then looked with a weird unholy interest in the wake of Gaffer s boat Easy does it betwixt us Shall I take him aboard pardner No said the other In so surly a tone that the man after a blank stare acknowledged it with the retort Arn t been eating nothing as has dis

you this way I ll try another and chop you over the fingers with the stretcher or take a pick at your head with the boat hook Cast off Pull you Lizzie Pull home since you won t let your father pull Lizzie shot ahead and the other boat fell astern Lizzie s father composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high moralities and taken an unassailable position slowly lighted a pipe and smoked and took a survey of what he had in tow What he had in tow lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was checked and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away though for the most part it followed submissively A neophyte might have fancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression on a sightless face but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies Chapter two THE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE mister and missus Veneering were bran new people in a bran new house in a bran new quarter of London Everything about the Veneerings was spick and span new All their furniture was new all their friends were new all their servants were new their plate was new their carriage was new their harness was new their horses were new their pictures were new they themselves were new they were as newly married as was lawfully compatible with their having a bran new baby and if they had set up a great grandfather he would have come home in matting from the Pantechnicon without a scratch upon him French polished to the crown of his head For in the Veneering establishment from the hall chairs with the new coat of arms to the grand pianoforte with the new action and upstairs again to the new fire escape all things were in a state of high varnish and polish And what was observable in the furniture was observable in the Veneerings the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop and was a trifle sticky There was an innocent piece of dinner furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable yard in Duke Street Saint James s when not in use to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind confusion The name of this article was Twemlow Being first cousin to Lord Snigsworth he was in frequent requisition and at many houses might be said to represent the dining table in its normal state mister and missus Veneering for example arranging a dinner habitually started with Twemlow and then put leaves in him or added guests to him Sometimes the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves sometimes of Twemlow and a dozen leaves sometimes Twemlow was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty leaves mister and missus Veneering on occasions of ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board and thus the parallel still held for it always happened that the more Twemlow was pulled out the further he found himself from the center and nearer to the sideboard at one end of the room or the window curtains at the other But it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in confusion This he was used to and could take soundings of The abyss to which he could find no bottom and from which started forth the engrossing and ever swelling difficulty of his life was the insoluble question whether he was Veneering s oldest friend or newest friend To the excogitation of this problem the harmless gentleman had devoted many anxious hours both in his lodgings over the livery stable yard and in the cold gloom favourable to meditation of Saint James s Square Thus Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club where Veneering then knew nobody but the man who made them known to one another who seemed to be the most intimate friend he had in the world and whom he had known two days the bond of union between their souls the nefarious conduct of the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal having been accidentally cemented at that date Immediately upon this Twemlow received an invitation to dine with Veneering and dined the man being of the party Immediately upon that Twemlow received an invitation to dine with the man and dined Veneering being of the party At the man s were a Member an Engineer a Payer off of the National Debt a Poem on Shakespeare a Grievance and a Public Office who all seem to be utter strangers to Veneering And yet immediately after that Twemlow received an invitation to dine at Veneerings expressly to meet the Member the Engineer the Payer off of the National Debt the Poem on Shakespeare the Grievance and the Public Office and dining discovered that all of them were the most intimate friends Veneering had in the world and that the wives of all of them who were all there were the objects of missus Veneering s most devoted affection and tender confidence Thus it had come about that mister Twemlow had said to himself in his lodgings with his hand to his forehead I must not think of this This is enough to soften any man s brain and yet was always thinking of it and could never form a conclusion This evening the Veneerings give a banquet Eleven leaves in the Twemlow fourteen in company all told Four pigeon breasted retainers in plain clothes stand in line in the hall A fifth retainer proceeding up the staircase with a mournful air as who should say Here is another wretched creature come to dinner such is life announces Mis ter Twemlow missus Veneering welcomes her sweet mister Twemlow mister Veneering welcomes his dear Twemlow missus Veneering does not expect that mister Twemlow can in nature care much for such insipid things as babies but so old a friend must please to look at baby Ah You will know the friend of your family better Tootleums says mister Veneering nodding emotionally at that new article when you begin to take notice He then begs to make his dear Twemlow known to his two friends mister Boots and mister Brewer and clearly has no distinct idea which is which But now a fearful circumstance occurs Mis ter and Mis sus Podsnap My dear says mister Veneering to missus Veneering with an air of much friendly interest while the door stands open the Podsnaps A too too smiling large man with a fatal freshness on him appearing with his wife instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with How do you do So glad to know you Charming house you have here I hope we are not late So glad of the opportunity I am sure When the first shock fell upon him Twemlow twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him but the large man closed with him and proved too strong Let me says the large man trying to attract the attention of his wife in the distance have the pleasure of presenting missus Podsnap to her host She will be in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase she will be so glad of the opportunity I am sure In the meantime missus Podsnap unable to originate a mistake on her own account because missus Veneering is the only other lady there does her best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband s by looking towards mister Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to missus Veneering in a feeling manner firstly that she fears he has been rather bilious of late and secondly that the baby is already very like him It is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for any other man but mister Veneering having this very evening set up the shirt front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home is not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow who is dry and weazen and some thirty years older missus Veneering equally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow As to Twemlow he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than Veneering that he considers the large man an offensive ass In this complicated dilemma mister Veneering approaches the large man with extended hand and smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he is delighted to see him who in his fatal freshness instantly replies Thank you I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall where we met but I am so glad of this opportunity I am sure Then pouncing upon Twemlow who holds back with all his feeble might he is haling him off to present him as Veneering to missus Podsnap when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake Whereupon having re shaken hands with Veneering as Veneering he re shakes hands with Twemlow as Twemlow and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying to the last named Ridiculous opportunity but so glad of it I am sure Now Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience having likewise noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots and having further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit themselves as to which is Veneering until Veneering has them in his grasp Twemlow having profited by these studies finds his brain wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is Veneering s oldest friend when his brain softens again and all is lost through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked together as twin brothers in the back drawing room near the conservatory door and through his ears informing him in the tones of missus Veneering that the same large man is to be baby s godfather Dinner is on the table Thus the melancholy retainer as who should say Come down and be poisoned ye unhappy children of men Twemlow having no lady assigned him goes down in the rear with his hand to his forehead Boots and Brewer thinking him indisposed whisper Man faint Had no lunch But he is only stunned by the unvanquishable difficulty of his existence Revived by soup Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with Boots and Brewer Is appealed to at the fish stage of the banquet by Veneering on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth is in or out of town Gives it that his cousin is out of town At Snigsworthy Park Veneering inquires At Snigsworthy Twemlow rejoins Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated and Veneering is clear that he is a remunerative article Meantime the retainer goes round like a gloomy Analytical Chemist always seeming to say after Chablis sir You wouldn t if you knew what it s made of The great looking glass above the sideboard reflects the table and the company Reflects the new Veneering crest in gold and eke in silver frosted and also thawed a camel of all work The Heralds College found out a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield or might have done it if he had thought of it and a caravan of camels take charge of the fruits and flowers and candles and kneel down be loaded with the salt Reflects Veneering forty wavy haired dark tending to corpulence sly mysterious filmy a kind of sufficiently well looking veiled prophet not prophesying Reflects missus Veneering fair aquiline nosed and fingered not so much light hair as she might have gorgeous in raiment and jewels enthusiastic propitiatory conscious that a corner of her husband s veil is over herself Reflects Podsnap prosperously feeding two little light coloured wiry wings one on either side of his else bald head looking as like his hairbrushes as his hair dissolving view of red beads on his forehead large allowance of crumpled shirt collar up behind Reflects missus Podsnap fine woman for Professor Owen quantity of bone neck and nostrils like a rocking horse hard features majestic head dress in which Podsnap has hung golden offerings Reflects Twemlow grey dry polite susceptible to east wind First Gentleman in Europe collar and cravat cheeks drawn in as if he had made a great effort to retire into himself some years ago and had got so far and had never got any farther Reflects mature young lady raven locks and complexion that lights up well when well powdered as it is carrying on considerably in the captivation of mature young gentleman with too much nose in his face too much ginger in his whiskers too much torso in his waistcoat too much sparkle in his studs his eyes his buttons his talk and his teeth Reflects charming old Lady Tippins on Veneering s right with an immense obtuse drab oblong face like a face in a tablespoon and a dyed Long Walk up the top of her head as a convenient public approach to the bunch of false hair behind pleased to patronize missus Veneering opposite who is pleased to be patronized Reflects a certain Mortimer another of Veneering s oldest friends who never was in the house before and appears not to want to come again who sits disconsolate on missus Veneering s left and who was inveigled by Lady Tippins a friend of his boyhood to come to these people s and talk and who won t talk Reflects Eugene friend of Mortimer buried alive in the back of his chair behind a shoulder with a powder epaulette on it of the mature young lady and gloomily resorting to the champagne chalice whenever proffered by the Analytical Chemist Lastly the looking glass reflects Boots and Brewer and two other stuffed Buffers interposed between the rest of the company and possible accidents The Veneering dinners are excellent dinners or new people wouldn t come and all goes well Notably Lady Tippins has made a series of experiments on her digestive functions so extremely complicated and daring that if they could be published with their results it might benefit the human race Having taken in provisions from all parts of the world this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole when as the ice plates are being removed the following words fall from her I assure you my dear Veneering Poor Twemlow s hand approaches his forehead for it would seem now that Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend I assure you my dear Veneering that it is the oddest affair Like the advertising people I don t ask you to trust me without offering a respectable reference Mortimer there is my reference and knows all about it Mortimer raises his drooping eyelids and slightly opens his mouth But a faint smile expressive of What s the use passes over his face and he drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth Now Mortimer says Lady Tippins rapping the sticks of her closed green fan upon the knuckles of her left hand which is particularly rich in knuckles I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about the man from Jamaica Give you my honour 
1027_125140_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I never heard of any 
none	none	man from Jamaica except the man who was a brother replies Mortimer Tobago then Nor yet from Tobago Except Eugene strikes in so unexpectedly that the mature young lady who has forgotten all about him with a start takes the epaulette out of his way except our friend who long lived on rice pudding and isinglass till at length to his something or other his physician said something else and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo A reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out An unfulfilled impression for he goes in again Now my dear missus Veneering quoth Lady Tippins I appeal to you whether this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world I carry my lovers about two or three at a time on condition that they are very obedient and devoted and here is my oldest lover in chief the head of all my slaves throwing off his allegiance before company And here is another of my lovers a rough Cymon at present certainly but of whom I had most hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of time pretending that he can t remember his nursery rhymes On purpose to annoy me for he knows how I doat upon them A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins s point She is always attended by a lover or two and she keeps a little list of her lovers and she is always booking a new lover or striking out an old lover or putting a lover in her black list or promoting a lover to her blue list or adding up her lovers or otherwise posting her book missus Veneering is charmed by the humour and so is Veneering Perhaps it is enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins s throat like the legs of scratching poultry I banish the false wretch from this moment and I strike him out of my Cupidon my name for my Ledger my dear this very night But I am resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere and I beg you to elicit it for me my love to missus Veneering as I have lost my own influence
497_125118_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh 
none	none	you perjured man This to Mortimer with a rattle of her fan We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere Veneering observes Then the four Buffers taking heart of grace all four at once say Deeply interested Quite excited Dramatic Man from Nowhere perhaps And then missus Veneering for the Lady Tippins s winning wiles are contagious folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child turns to her left neighbour and says Tease Pay Man from Tumwhere At which the four Buffers again mysteriously moved all four at once explain You can t resist Upon my life says Mortimer languidly I find it immensely embarrassing to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent and my only consolation is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in your secret hearts when you find as you inevitably will the man from Somewhere a bore Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local habitation but he comes from the place the name of which escapes me but will suggest itself to everybody else here where they make the wine Eugene suggests Day and Martin s No not that place returns the unmoved Mortimer that s where they make the Port My man comes from the country where they make the Cape Wine But look here old fellow its not at all statistical and it s rather odd It is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings that no man troubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves and that any one who has anything to tell generally tells it to anybody else in preference The man Mortimer goes on addressing Eugene whose name is Harmon was only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust Red velveteens and a bell the gloomy Eugene inquires And a ladder and basket if you like By which means or by others he grew rich as a Dust Contractor and lived in a hollow in a hilly country entirely composed of Dust On his own small estate the growling old vagabond threw up his own mountain range like an old volcano and its geological formation was Dust Coal dust vegetable dust bone dust crockery dust rough dust and sifted dust all manner of Dust A passing remembrance of missus Veneering here induces Mortimer to address his next half dozen words to her after which he wanders away again tries Twemlow and finds he doesn t answer ultimately takes up with the Buffers who receive him enthusiastically The moral being I believe that s the right expression of this exemplary person derived its highest gratification from anathematizing his nearest relations and turning them out of doors Having begun as was natural by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom he next found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the claims of his daughter He chose a husband for her entirely to his own satisfaction and not in the least to hers and proceeded to settle upon her as her marriage portion I don t know how much Dust but something immense At this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully intimated that she was secretly engaged to that popular character whom the novelists and versifiers call Another and that such a marriage would make Dust of her heart and Dust of her life in short would set her up on a very extensive scale in her father s business Immediately the venerable parent on a cold winter s night it is said anathematized and turned her out Here the Analytical Chemist who has evidently formed a very low opinion of Mortimer s story concedes a little claret to the Buffers who again mysteriously moved all four at once screw it slowly into themselves with a peculiar twist of enjoyment as they cry in chorus Pray go on The pecuniary resources of Another were as they usually are of a very limited nature I believe I am not using too strong an expression when I say that Another was hard up However he married the young lady and they lived in a humble dwelling probably possessing a porch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining until she died I must refer you to the Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was situated for the certified cause of death but early sorrow and anxiety may have had to do with it though they may not appear in the ruled pages and printed forms Indisputably this was the case with Another for he was so cut up by the loss of his young wife that if he outlived her a year it was as much as he did There is that in the indolent Mortimer which seems to hint that if good society might on any account allow itself to be impressible he one of good society might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here relates It is hidden with great pains but it is in him The gloomy Eugene too is not without some kindred touch for when that appalling Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived he should have gone down at the head of her list of lovers and also when the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes and laughs at some private and confidential comment from the mature young gentleman his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert knife Mortimer proceeds We must now return as novelists say and as we all wish they wouldn t to the man from Somewhere Being a boy of fourteen cheaply educated at Brussels when his sister s expulsion befell it was some little time before he heard of it probably from herself for the mother was dead but that I don t know Instantly he absconded and came over here He must have been a boy of spirit and resource to get here on a stopped allowance of five sous a week but he did it somehow and he burst in on his father and pleaded his sister s cause Venerable parent promptly resorts to anathematization and turns him out Shocked and terrified boy takes flight seeks his fortune gets aboard ship ultimately turns up on dry land among the Cape wine small proprietor farmer grower whatever you like to call it At this juncture shuffling is heard in the hall and tapping is heard at the dining room door Analytical Chemist goes to the door confers angrily with unseen tapper appears to become mollified by descrying reason in the tapping and goes out So he was discovered only the other day after having been expatriated about fourteen years A Buffer suddenly astounding the other three by detaching himself and asserting individuality inquires How discovered and why Ah To be sure Thank you for reminding me Venerable parent dies Same Buffer emboldened by success says When The other day Ten or twelve months ago Same Buffer inquires with smartness What of But herein perishes a melancholy example being regarded by the three other Buffers with a stony stare and attracting no further attention from any mortal Venerable parent Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there is a Veneering at table and for the first time addressing him dies The gratified Veneering repeats gravely dies and folds his arms and composes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner when he finds himself again deserted in the bleak world His will is found said Mortimer catching missus Podsnap s rocking horse s eye It is dated very soon after the son s flight It leaves the lowest of the range of dust mountains with some sort of a dwelling house at its foot to an old servant who is sole executor and all the rest of the property which is very considerable to the son He directs himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and precautions against his coming to life with which I need not bore you and that s all except and this ends the story The Analytical Chemist returning everybody looks at him Not because anybody wants to see him but because of that subtle influence in nature which impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at anything rather than the person who addresses it Except that the son s inheriting is made conditional on his marrying a girl who at the date of the will was a child of four or five years old and who is now a marriageable young woman Advertisement and inquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere and at the present moment he is on his way home from there no doubt in a state of great astonishment to succeed to a very large fortune and to take a wife missus Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of personal charms Mortimer is unable to report mister Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune in the event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled Mortimer replies that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant above mentioned passing over and excluding the son also that if the son had not been living the same old servant would have been sole residuary legatee missus Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a snore by dexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her knuckles across the table when everybody but Mortimer himself becomes aware that the Analytical Chemist is in a ghostly manner offering him a folded paper Curiosity detains missus Veneering a few moments Mortimer in spite of all the arts of the chemist placidly refreshes himself with a glass of Madeira and remains unconscious of the Document which engrosses the general attention until Lady Tippins who has a habit of waking totally insensible having remembered where she is and recovered a perception of surrounding objects says Falser man than Don Juan why don t you take the note from the commendatore Upon which the chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer who looks round at him and says What s this Analytical Chemist bends and whispers WHO Says Mortimer Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers Mortimer stares at him and unfolds the paper Reads it reads it twice turns it over to look at the blank outside reads it a third time This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner says Mortimer then looking with an altered face round the table this is the conclusion of the story of the identical man Already married one guesses Declines to marry another guesses Codicil among the dust another guesses Why no says Mortimer remarkable thing you are all wrong The story is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed Man s drowned Chapter three 
483-125116-0000	train-other-500	ANOTHER MAN As the disappearing skirts of the ladies ascended the Veneering staircase Mortimer following them forth from the dining room turned into a library of bran new books in bran new bindings liberally gilded
483-125116-0001	train-other-500	and requested to see the messenger who had brought the paper He was a boy of about fifteen Mortimer looked at the boy and the boy looked at the bran new pilgrims on the wall going to Canterbury in more gold frame than procession and more carving than country Whose writing is this
483-125116-0002	train-other-500	Mine sir Who told you to write it My father Jesse Hexam Is it he who found the body Yes sir What is your father The boy hesitated
none	none	 looked reproachfully at the pilgrims as if they had involved him in a little difficulty 
483-125116-0003	train-other-500	then said folding a plait in the right leg of his trousers He gets his living along shore Is it far
none	none	 Is which far asked the boy upon his guard and again upon the road to Canterbury To your father s 
483-125116-0004	train-other-500	It s a goodish stretch sir I come up in a cab and the cab s waiting to be paid We could go back in it before you paid it if you liked
none	none	 I went first to your office according to the direction of the papers found in the pockets and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age who sent me on here 
483-125116-0005	train-other-500	There was a curious mixture in the boy of uncompleted savagery and uncompleted civilization His voice was hoarse and coarse and his face was coarse and his stunted figure was coarse but he was cleaner than other boys of his type and his writing though large and round was good
483-125116-0006	train-other-500	and he glanced at the backs of the books with an awakened curiosity that went below the binding No one who can read ever looks at a book even unopened on a shelf like one who cannot Were any means taken do you know boy to ascertain if it was possible to restore life
483-125116-0007	train-other-500	Mortimer inquired as he sought for his hat You wouldn t ask sir if you knew his state
none	none	 Pharaoh s multitude that were drowned in the Red Sea ain t more beyond restoring to life 
483-125116-0008	train-other-500	If Lazarus was only half as far gone that was the greatest of all the miracles Halloa cried Mortimer turning round with his hat upon his head you seem to be at home in the Red Sea my young friend Read of it with teacher at the school said the boy
483-125116-0009	train-other-500	And Lazarus Yes and him too But don t you tell my father We should have no peace in our place if that got touched upon It s my sister s contriving
none	none	 You seem to have a good sister She ain t half bad 
483-125116-0010	train-other-500	said the boy but if she knows her letters it s the most she does and them I learned her
none	none	 The gloomy Eugene with his hands in his pockets had strolled in and assisted at the latter part of the dialogue 
483-125116-0011	train-other-500	when the boy spoke these words slightingly of his sister he took him roughly enough by the chin and turned up his face to look at it Well I m sure sir said the boy resisting I hope you ll know me again
483-125116-0012	train-other-500	Eugene vouchsafed no answer but made the proposal to Mortimer I ll go with you if you like So they all three went away together in the vehicle that had brought the boy the two friends once boys together at a public school inside smoking cigars
483-125116-0013	train-other-500	the messenger on the box beside the driver Let me see said Mortimer as they went along
483-125116-0014	train-other-500	I have been Eugene upon the honourable roll of solicitors of the High Court of Chancery and attorneys at Common Law five years and except gratuitously taking instructions on an average once a fortnight for the will of Lady Tippins who has nothing to leave
483-125116-0015	train-other-500	I have had no scrap of business but this romantic business And I said Eugene
none	none	 have been called seven years and have had no business at all and never shall have any And if I had I shouldn t know how to do it 
483-125116-0016	train-other-500	I am far from being clear as to the last particular returned Mortimer with great composure that I have much advantage over you I hate said Eugene putting his legs up on the opposite seat I hate my profession
483-125116-0017	train-other-500	Shall I incommode you if I put mine up too returned Mortimer Thank you I hate mine It was forced upon me said the gloomy Eugene because it was understood that we wanted a barrister in the family
none	none	 We have got a precious one 
483-125116-0018	train-other-500	It was forced upon me said Mortimer because it was understood that we wanted a solicitor in the family And we have got a precious one There are four of us with our names painted on a door post in right of one black hole called a set of chambers said Eugene
483-125116-0019	train-other-500	and each of us has the fourth of a clerk Cassim Baba in the robber s cave and Cassim is the only respectable member of the party I am one by myself one said Mortimer
483-125116-0020	train-other-500	high up an awful staircase commanding a burial ground and I have a whole clerk to myself and he has nothing to do but look at the burial ground and what he will turn out when arrived at maturity I cannot conceive
483-125116-0021	train-other-500	Whether in that shabby rook s nest he is always plotting wisdom or plotting murder whether he will grow up after so much solitary brooding to enlighten his fellow creatures or to poison them is the only speck of interest that presents itself to my professional view
none	none	 Will you give me a light 
483-125116-0022	train-other-500	Thank you Then idiots talk said Eugene leaning back folding his arms smoking with his eyes shut and speaking slightly through his nose of Energy If there is a word in the dictionary under any letter from A to Z that I abominate it is energy
483-125116-0023	train-other-500	It is such a conventional superstition such parrot gabble What the deuce Am I to rush out into the street collar the first man of a wealthy appearance that I meet shake him and say Go to law upon the spot you dog and retain me or I ll be the death of you Yet that would be energy
483-125116-0024	train-other-500	Precisely my view of the case Eugene But show me a good opportunity show me something really worth being energetic about and I ll show you energy And so will I said Eugene
none	none	 And it is likely enough that ten thousand other young men within the limits of the London Post office town delivery made the same hopeful remark in the course of the same evening 
483-125116-0025	train-other-500	The wheels rolled on and rolled down by the Monument and by the Tower and by the Docks down by Ratcliffe and by Rotherhithe
483-125116-0026	train-other-500	down by where accumulated scum of humanity seemed to be washed from higher grounds like so much moral sewage and to be pausing until its own weight forced it over the bank and sunk it in the river
none	none	 In and out among vessels that seemed to have got ashore and houses that seemed to have got afloat 
483-125116-0027	train-other-500	among bow splits staring into windows and windows staring into ships the wheels rolled on until they stopped at a dark corner river washed and otherwise not washed at all where the boy alighted and opened the door You must walk the rest sir it s not many yards
483-125116-0028	train-other-500	He spoke in the singular number to the express exclusion of Eugene This is a confoundedly out of the way place said Mortimer slipping over the stones and refuse on the shore as the boy turned the corner sharp Here s my father s sir where the light is
483-125116-0029	train-other-500	The low building had the look of having once been a mill
none	none	 There was a rotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where the sails had been 
483-125116-0030	train-other-500	but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the obscurity of the night The boy lifted the latch of the door and they passed at once into a low circular room where a man stood before a red fire looking down into it and a girl sat engaged in needlework
483-125116-0031	train-other-500	The fire was in a rusty brazier not fitted to the hearth and a common lamp shaped like a hyacinth root smoked and flared in the neck of a stone bottle on the table There was a wooden bunk or berth in a corner
none	none	 and in another corner a wooden stair leading above so clumsy and steep that it was little better than a ladder 
483-125116-0032	train-other-500	Two or three old sculls and oars stood against the wall and against another part of the wall was a small dresser making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery and cooking vessels The roof of the room was not plastered but was formed of the flooring of the room above
483-125116-0033	train-other-500	This being very old knotted seamed and beamed gave a lowering aspect to the chamber and roof and walls and floor alike abounding in old smears of flour red lead or some such stain which it had probably acquired in warehousing and damp alike had a look of decomposition
483-125116-0034	train-other-500	The gentleman father The figure at the red fire turned raised its ruffled head and looked like a bird of prey You re Mortimer Lightwood Esquire are you sir Mortimer Lightwood is my name What you found
483-125116-0035	train-other-500	said Mortimer glancing rather shrinkingly towards the bunk is it here Tain t not to say here but it s close by I do everything reg lar
none	none	 I ve giv notice of the circumstarnce to the police and the police have took possession of it 
483-125116-0036	train-other-500	No time ain t been lost on any hand The police have put into print already and here s what the print says of it Taking up the bottle with the lamp in it he held it near a paper on the wall with the police heading BODY FOUND
483-125116-0037	train-other-500	The two friends read the handbill as it stuck against the wall and Gaffer read them as he held the light Only papers on the unfortunate man I see said Lightwood glancing from the description of what was found to the finder Only papers
483-125116-0038	train-other-500	Here the girl arose with her work in her hand and went out at the door No money pursued Mortimer but threepence in one of the skirt pockets Three Penny Pieces said Gaffer Hexam in as many sentences
483-125116-0039	train-other-500	The trousers pockets empty and turned inside out Gaffer Hexam nodded But that s common
none	none	 Whether it s the wash of the tide or no I can t say 
483-125116-0040	train-other-500	Now here moving the light to another similar placard HIS pockets was found empty and turned inside out And here moving the light to another HER pocket was found empty and turned inside out And so was this one s And so was that one s
none	none	 I can t read nor I don t want to it for I know em by their places on the wall 
483-125116-0041	train-other-500	This one was a sailor with two anchors and a flag and G F T on his arm Look and see if he warn t Quite right This one was the young woman in grey boots and her linen marked with a cross Look and see if she warn t Quite right
483-125116-0042	train-other-500	This is him as had a nasty cut over the eye This is them two young sisters what tied themselves together with a handkecher This the drunken old chap in a pair of list slippers and a nightcap wot had offered it afterwards come out
none	none	 to make a hole in the water for a quartern of rum stood aforehand and kept to his word for the first and last time in his life 
483-125116-0043	train-other-500	They pretty well papers the room you see but I know em all I m scholar enough He waved the light over the whole as if to typify the light of his scholarly intelligence and then put it down on the table and stood behind it looking intently at his visitors
483-125116-0044	train-other-500	He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey that when he knitted his brow his ruffled crest stood highest You did not find all these yourself did you asked Eugene To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined And what might YOUR name be now
500_125123_000053_000001	train-clean-360	You did 
none	none	not find all these yourself did you asked Eugene To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined And what might YOUR name be now 
483-125116-0045	train-other-500	This is my friend Mortimer Lightwood interposed mister Eugene Wrayburn mister Eugene Wrayburn is it And what might mister Eugene Wrayburn have asked of me I asked you simply if you found all these yourself
1027_125147_000139_000000	train-clean-360	 Wrayburn 
none	none	mister Eugene Wrayburn is it And what might mister Eugene Wrayburn have asked of me I asked you simply if you found all these yourself 
483-125116-0046	train-other-500	I answer you simply most on em Do you suppose there has been much violence and robbery beforehand among these cases I don t suppose at all about it returned Gaffer I ain t one of the supposing sort
none	none	 If you d got your living to haul out of the river
501_125128_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 every day 
none	none	of your life 
483-125116-0047	train-other-500	you mightn t be much given to supposing Am I to show the way As he opened the door in pursuance of a nod from Lightwood an extremely pale and disturbed face appeared in the doorway the face of a man much agitated A body missing
483-125116-0048	train-other-500	asked Gaffer Hexam stopping short or a body found Which
none	none	 I am lost replied the man in a hurried and an eager manner Lost I I am a stranger and don t know the way I I want to find the place where I can see what is described here It is possible I may know it He was panting and could hardly speak but he showed a copy of the newly printed bill that was still wet upon the wall Perhaps its newness or perhaps the accuracy of his observation of its general look guided Gaffer to a ready conclusion This gentleman mister Lightwood is on that business mister Lightwood During a pause Mortimer and the stranger confronted each other Neither knew the other I think sir said Mortimer breaking the awkward silence with his airy self possession that you did me the honour to mention my name I repeated it after this man You said you were a stranger in London An utter stranger Are you seeking a mister Harmon No Then I believe I can assure you that you are on a fruitless errand and will not find what you fear to find Will you come with us A little winding through some muddy alleys that might have been deposited by the last ill savoured tide brought them to the wicket gate and bright lamp of a Police Station where they found the Night Inspector with a pen and ink and ruler posting up his books in a whitewashed office as studiously as if he were in a monastery on top of a mountain and no howling fury of a drunken woman were banging herself against a cell door in the back yard at his elbow With the same air of a recluse much given to study he desisted from his books to bestow a distrustful nod of recognition upon Gaffer plainly importing Ah 
1027_125147_000049_000002	train-clean-360	we know 
none	none	all about YOU and you ll overdo it some day and to inform mister Mortimer Lightwood and friends that he would attend them immediately Then he finished ruling the work he had in hand it might have been illuminating a missal he was so calm in a very neat and methodical manner showing not the slightest consciousness of the woman who was banging herself with increased violence and shrieking most terrifically for some other woman s liver A bull s eye said the Night Inspector taking up his keys Which a deferential satellite produced Now gentlemen With one of his keys he opened a cool grot at the end of the yard and they all went in They quickly came out again no one speaking but Eugene who remarked to Mortimer in a whisper Not MUCH worse than Lady Tippins So back to the whitewashed library of the monastery with that liver still in shrieking requisition as it had been loudly while they looked at the silent sight they came to see and there through the merits of the case as summed up by the Abbot No clue to how body came into river Very often was no clue Too late to know for certain whether injuries received before or after death one excellent surgical opinion said before other excellent surgical opinion said after Steward of ship in which gentleman came home passenger had been round to view and could swear to identity Likewise could swear to clothes And then you see you had the papers too How was it he had totally disappeared on leaving ship till found in river Well Probably had been upon some little game Probably thought it a harmless game wasn t up to things and it turned out a fatal game Inquest to morrow and no doubt open verdict It appears to have knocked your friend over knocked him completely off his legs mister Inspector remarked when he had finished his summing up It has given him a bad turn to be sure This was said in a very low voice and with a searching look not the first he had cast at the stranger mister Lightwood explained that it was no friend of his Indeed said mister Inspector with an attentive ear where did you pick him up mister Lightwood explained further mister Inspector had delivered his summing up and had added these words with his elbows leaning on his desk and the fingers and thumb of his right hand fitting themselves to the fingers and thumb of his left mister Inspector moved nothing but his eyes as he now added raising his voice Turned you faint sir Seems you re not accustomed to this kind of work The stranger who was leaning against the chimneypiece with drooping head looked round and answered No It s a horrible sight You expected to identify I am told sir Yes HAVE you identified No It s a horrible sight O a horrible horrible sight Who did you think it might have been asked mister Inspector Give us a description sir Perhaps we can help you No no said the stranger it would be quite useless Good night mister Inspector had not moved and had given no order but the satellite slipped his back against the wicket and laid his left arm along the top of it and with his right hand turned the bull s eye he had taken from his chief in quite a casual manner towards the stranger You missed a friend you know or you missed a foe you know or you wouldn t have come here you know Well then ain t it reasonable to ask who was it Thus mister Inspector You must excuse my telling you No class of man can understand better than you that families may not choose to publish their disagreements and misfortunes except on the last necessity I do not dispute that you discharge your duty in asking me the question you will not dispute my right to withhold the answer Good night Again he turned towards the wicket where the satellite with his eye upon his chief remained a dumb statue At least said mister Inspector you will not object to leave me your card sir I should not object if I had one but I have not He reddened and was much confused as he gave the answer At least said mister Inspector with no change of voice or manner you will not object to write down your name and address Not at all mister Inspector dipped a pen in his inkstand and deftly laid it on a piece of paper close beside him then resumed his former attitude The stranger stepped up to the desk and wrote in a rather tremulous hand mister Inspector taking sidelong note of every hair of his head when it was bent down for the purpose mister Julius Handford Exchequer Coffee House Palace Yard Westminster Staying there I presume sir Staying there Consequently from the country Eh Yes from the country Good night sir The satellite removed his arm and opened the wicket and mister Julius Handford went out Reserve said mister Inspector Take care of this piece of paper keep him in view without giving offence ascertain that he IS staying there and find out anything you can about him The satellite was gone and mister Inspector becoming once again the quiet Abbot of that Monastery dipped his pen in his ink and resumed his books The two friends who had watched him more amused by the professional manner than suspicious of mister Julius Handford inquired before taking their departure too whether he believed there was anything that really looked bad here The Abbot replied with reticence couldn t say If a murder anybody might have done it Burglary or pocket picking wanted prenticeship Not so murder We were all of us up to that Had seen scores of people come to identify and never saw one person struck in that particular way Might however have been Stomach and not Mind If so rum stomach But to be sure there were rum everythings Pity there was not a word of truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the hand of the right person you never got a sign out of bodies You got row enough out of such as her she was good for all night now referring here to the banging demands for the liver but you got nothing out of bodies if it was ever so There being nothing more to be done until the Inquest was held next day the friends went away together and Gaffer Hexam and his son went their separate way But arriving at the last corner Gaffer bade his boy go home while he turned into a red curtained tavern that stood dropsically bulging over the causeway for a half a pint The boy lifted the latch he had lifted before and found his sister again seated before the fire at her work Who raised her head upon his coming in and asking Where did you go Liz I went out in the dark There was no necessity for that It was

none	none	Father s tread It being now past midnight the bird of prey went straight to roost At mid day following he reappeared at the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in the character not new to him of a witness before a Coroner s Jury mister Mortimer Lightwood besides sustaining the character of one of the witnesses doubled the part with that of the eminent solicitor who watched the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deceased as was duly recorded in the newspapers mister Inspector watched the proceedings too and kept his watching closely to himself mister Julius Handford having given his right address and being reported in solvent circumstances as to his bill though nothing more was known of him at his hotel except that his way of life was very retired had no summons to appear and was merely present in the shades of mister Inspector s mind The case was made interesting to the public by mister Mortimer Lightwood s evidence touching the circumstances under which the deceased mister John Harmon had returned to England exclusive private proprietorship in which circumstances was set up at dinner tables for several days by Veneering Twemlow Podsnap and all the Buffers who all related them irreconcilably with one another and contradicted themselves It was also made interesting by the testimony of Job Potterson the ship s steward and one mister Jacob Kibble a fellow passenger that the deceased mister John Harmon did bring over in a hand valise with which he did disembark the sum realized by the forced sale of his little landed property and that the sum exceeded in ready money seven hundred pounds It was further made interesting by the remarkable experiences of Jesse Hexam in having rescued from the Thames so many dead bodies and for whose behoof a rapturous admirer subscribing himself A friend to Burial perhaps an undertaker sent eighteen postage stamps and five Now Sir s to the editor of the Times Upon the evidence adduced before them the Jury found That the body of mister John Harmon had been discovered floating in the Thames in an advanced state of decay and much injured and that the said mister John Harmon had come by his death under highly suspicious circumstances though by whose act or in what precise manner there was no evidence before this Jury to show And they appended to their verdict a recommendation to the Home Office which mister Inspector appeared to think highly sensible to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery Within eight and forty hours a reward of One Hundred Pounds was proclaimed together with a free pardon to any person or persons not the actual perpetrator or perpetrators and so forth in due form This Proclamation rendered mister Inspector additionally studious and caused him to stand meditating on river stairs and causeways and to go lurking about in boats putting this and that together But according to the success with which you put this and that together you get a woman and a fish apart or a Mermaid in combination And mister Inspector could turn out nothing better than a Mermaid which no Judge and Jury would believe in Thus like the tides on which it had been borne to the knowledge of men the Harmon Murder as it came to be popularly called went up and down and ebbed and flowed now in the town now in the country now among palaces now among hovels now among lords and ladies and gentlefolks now among labourers and hammerers and ballast heavers until at last after a long interval of slack water it got out to sea and drifted away Chapter four THE R WILFER FAMILY Reginald Wilfer is a name with rather a grand sound suggesting on first acquaintance brasses in country churches scrolls in stained glass windows and generally the De Wilfers who came over with the Conqueror For it is a remarkable fact in genealogy that no De Any ones ever came over with Anybody else But the Reginald Wilfer family were of such commonplace extraction and pursuits that their forefathers had for generations modestly subsisted on the Docks the Excise Office and the Custom House and the existing R Wilfer was a poor clerk So poor a clerk though having a limited salary and an unlimited family that he had never yet attained the modest object of his ambition which was to wear a complete new suit of clothes hat and boots included at one time His black hat was brown before he could afford a coat his pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots his boots had worn out before he could treat himself to new pantaloons and by the time he worked round to the hat again that shining modern article roofed in an ancient ruin of various periods If the conventional Cherub could ever grow up and be clothed he might be photographed as a portrait of Wilfer His chubby smooth innocent appearance was a reason for his being always treated with condescension when he was not put down A stranger entering his own poor house at about ten o clock P M might have been surprised to find him sitting up to supper So boyish was he in his curves and proportions that his old schoolmaster meeting him in Cheapside might have been unable to withstand the temptation of caning him on the spot In short he was the conventional cherub after the supposititious shoot just mentioned rather grey with signs of care on his expression and in decidedly insolvent circumstances He was shy and unwilling to own to the name of Reginald as being too aspiring and self assertive a name In his signature he used only the initial R and imparted what it really stood for to none but chosen friends under the seal of confidence Out of this the facetious habit had arisen in the neighbourhood surrounding Mincing Lane of making christian names for him of adjectives and participles beginning with R Some of these were more or less appropriate as Rusty Retiring Ruddy Round Ripe Ridiculous Ruminative others derived their point from their want of application as Raging Rattling Roaring Raffish But his popular name was Rumty which in a moment of inspiration had been bestowed upon him by a gentleman of convivial habits connected with the drug markets as the beginning of a social chorus his leading part in the execution of which had led this gentleman to the Temple of Fame and of which the whole expressive burden ran Rumty iddity row dow dow Sing toodlely teedlely bow wow wow Thus he was constantly addressed even in minor notes on business as Dear Rumty in answer to which he sedately signed himself Yours truly R Wilfer He was clerk in the drug house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles Chicksey and Stobbles his former masters had both become absorbed in Veneering once their traveller or commission agent who had signalized his accession to supreme power by bringing into the business a quantity of plate glass window and French polished mahogany partition and a gleaming and enormous doorplate R Wilfer locked up his desk one evening and putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg top made for home His home was in the Holloway region north of London and then divided from it by fields and trees Between Battle Bridge and that part of the Holloway district in which he dwelt was a tract of suburban Sahara where tiles and bricks were burnt bones were boiled carpets were beat rubbish was shot dogs were fought and dust was heaped by contractors Skirting the border of this desert by the way he took when the light of its kiln fires made lurid smears on the fog R Wilfer sighed and shook his head Ah me said he what might have been is not what is With which commentary on human life indicating an experience of it not exclusively his own he made the best of his way to the end of his journey missus Wilfer was

none	none	a tall woman and an angular Her lord being cherubic she was necessarily majestic according to the principle which matrimonially unites contrasts She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket handkerchief knotted under the chin This head gear in conjunction with a pair of gloves worn within doors she seemed to consider as at once a kind of armour against misfortune invariably assuming it when in low spirits or difficulties and as a species of full dress It was therefore with some sinking of the spirit that her husband beheld her thus heroically attired putting down her candle in the little hall and coming down the doorsteps through the little front court to open the gate for him Something had gone wrong with the house door for R Wilfer stopped on the steps staring at it and cried Hal loa Yes said missus Wilfer the man came himself with a pair of pincers and took it off and took it away He said that as he had no expectation of ever being paid for it and as he had an order for another LADIES SCHOOL door plate it was better burnished up for the interests of all parties Perhaps it was my dear what do you think You are master here R W returned his wife It is as you think not as I do Perhaps it might have been better if the man had taken the door too My dear we couldn t have done without the door Couldn t we Why my dear Could we It is as you think R W not as I do With those submissive words the dutiful wife preceded him down a few stairs to a little basement front room half kitchen half parlour where a girl of about nineteen with an exceedingly pretty figure and face but with an impatient and petulant expression both in her face and in her shoulders which in her sex and at her age are very expressive of discontent sat playing draughts with a younger girl who was the youngest of the House of Wilfer Not to encumber this page by telling off the Wilfers in detail and casting them up in the gross it is enough for the present that the rest were what is called out in the world in various ways and that they were Many So many that when one of his dutiful children called in to see him R Wilfer generally seemed to say to himself after a little mental arithmetic Oh here s another of em before adding aloud How de do John or Susan as the case might be Well Piggywiggies said R W how de do to night What I was thinking of my dear to missus Wilfer already seated in a corner with folded gloves was that as we have let our first floor so well and as we have now no place in which you could teach pupils even if pupils The milkman said he knew of two young ladies of the highest respectability who were in search of a suitable establishment and he took a card interposed missus Wilfer with severe monotony as if she were reading an Act of Parliament aloud Tell your father whether it was last Monday Bella But we never heard any more of it ma said Bella the elder girl In addition to which my dear her husband urged if you have no place to put two young persons into Pardon me missus Wilfer again interposed they were not young persons Two young ladies of the highest respectability Tell your father Bella whether the milkman said so My dear it is the same thing No it is not said missus Wilfer with the same impressive monotony Pardon me I mean my dear it is the same thing as to space As to space If you have no space in which to put two youthful fellow creatures however eminently respectable which I do not doubt where are those youthful fellow creatures to be accommodated I carry it no further than that And solely looking at it said her husband making the stipulation at once in a conciliatory complimentary and argumentative tone as I am sure you will agree my love from a fellow creature point of view my dear I have nothing more to say returned missus Wilfer with a meek renunciatory action of her gloves It is as you think R W not as I do Here the huffing of Miss Bella and the loss of three of her men at a swoop aggravated by the coronation of an opponent led to that young lady s jerking the draught board and pieces off the table which her sister went down on her knees to pick up Poor Bella said missus Wilfer And poor Lavinia perhaps my dear suggested R W Pardon me said missus Wilfer no It was one of the worthy woman s specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or worldly minded humours by extolling her own family which she thus proceeded in the present case to do No R W Lavinia has not known the trial that Bella has known The trial that your daughter Bella has undergone is perhaps without a parallel and has been borne I will say Nobly When you see your daughter Bella in her black dress which she alone of all the family wears and when you remember the circumstances which have led to her wearing it and when you know how those circumstances have been sustained then R W lay your head upon your pillow and say Poor Lavinia Here Miss Lavinia from her kneeling situation under the table put in that she didn t want to be poored by pa or anybody else I am sure you do not my dear returned her mother for you have a fine brave spirit And your sister Cecilia has a fine brave spirit of another kind a spirit of pure devotion a beau ti ful spirit The self sacrifice of Cecilia reveals a pure and womanly character very seldom equalled never surpassed I have now in my pocket a letter

go pa Here in this corner He looked at the beautiful brown hair shading the coquettish face he looked at the free dash of the signature which was a bold one for a woman s and then they looked at one another Much obliged to you Miss Wilfer Obliged I have given you so much trouble Signing my name Yes certainly But I am your landlord s daughter sir As there was nothing more to do but pay eight sovereigns in earnest of the bargain pocket the agreement appoint a time for the arrival of his furniture and himself and go mister Rokesmith did that as awkwardly as it might be done and was escorted by his landlord to the outer air When R Wilfer returned candlestick in hand to the bosom of his family he found the bosom agitated Pa said Bella we have got a Murderer for a tenant Pa said Lavinia we have got a Robber To see him unable for his life to look anybody in the face said Bella There never was such an exhibition My dears said their father he is a diffident gentleman and I should say particularly so in the society of girls of your age Nonsense our age cried Bella impatiently What s that got to do with him Besides we are not of the same age which age demanded Lavinia Never YOU mind Lavvy retorted Bella you wait till you are of an age to ask such questions Pa mark my words Between mister Rokesmith and me there is a natural antipathy and a deep distrust and something will come of it My dear and girls said the cherub patriarch between mister Rokesmith and me there is a matter of eight sovereigns and something for supper shall come of it if you ll agree upon the article This was a neat and happy turn to give the subject treats being rare in the Wilfer household where a monotonous appearance of Dutch cheese at ten o clock in the evening had been rather frequently commented on by the dimpled shoulders of Miss Bella Indeed the modest Dutchman himself seemed conscious of his want of variety and generally came before the family in a state of apologetic perspiration After some discussion on the relative merits of veal cutlet sweetbread and lobster a decision was pronounced in favour of veal cutlet missus Wilfer then solemnly divested herself of her handkerchief and gloves as a preliminary sacrifice to preparing the frying pan and R W himself went out to purchase the viand He soon returned bearing the same in a fresh cabbage leaf where it coyly embraced a rasher of ham Melodious sounds were not long in rising from the frying pan on the fire or in seeming as the firelight danced in the mellow halls of a couple of full bottles on the table to play appropriate dance music The cloth was laid by Lavvy Bella as the acknowledged ornament of the family employed both her hands in giving her hair an additional wave while sitting in the easiest chair and occasionally threw in a direction touching the supper as Very brown ma or to her sister Put the saltcellar straight miss and don t be a dowdy little puss Meantime her father chinking mister Rokesmith s gold as he sat expectant between his knife and fork remarked that six of those sovereigns came just in time for their landlord and stood them in a little pile on the white tablecloth to look at I hate our landlord said Bella But observing a fall in her father s face she went and sat down by him at the table and began touching up his hair with the handle of a fork It was one of the girl s spoilt ways to be always arranging the family s hair perhaps because her own was so pretty and occupied so much of her attention You deserve to have a house of your own don t you poor pa I don t deserve it better than another my dear At any rate I for one want it more than another said Bella holding him by the chin as she stuck his flaxen hair on end and I grudge this money going to the Monster that swallows up so much when we all want Everything And if you say as you want to say I know you want to say so pa that s neither reasonable nor honest Bella then I answer Maybe not pa very likely but it s one of the consequences of being poor and of thoroughly hating and detesting to be poor and that s my case Now you look lovely pa why don t you always wear your hair like that And here s the cutlet If it isn t very brown ma I can t eat it and must have a bit put back to be done expressly However as it was brown even to Bella s taste the young lady graciously partook of it without reconsignment to the frying pan and also in due course of the contents of the two bottles whereof one held Scotch ale and the other rum The latter perfume with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon peel diffused itself throughout the room and became so highly concentrated around the warm fireside that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off charged with a delicious whiff of it after buzzing like a great bee at that particular chimneypot Pa said Bella sipping the fragrant mixture and warming her favourite ankle when old mister Harmon made such a fool of me not to mention himself as he is dead what do you suppose he did it for Impossible to say my dear As I have told you time out of number since his will was brought to light I doubt if I ever exchanged a hundred words with the old gentleman If it was his whim to surprise us his whim succeeded For he certainly did it And I was stamping my foot and screaming when he first took notice of me was I said Bella contemplating the ankle before mentioned You were stamping your little foot my dear and screaming with your little voice and laying into me with your little bonnet which you had snatched off for the purpose returned her father as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum you were doing this one Sunday morning when I took you out because I didn t go the exact way you wanted when the old gentleman sitting on a seat near said That s a nice girl that s a VERY nice girl a promising girl And so you were my dear And then he asked my name did he pa Then he asked your name my dear and mine and on other Sunday mornings when we walked his way we saw him again and and really that s all As that was all the rum and water too or in other words as R W delicately signified that his glass was empty by throwing back his head and standing the glass upside down on his nose and upper lip it might have been charitable in missus Wilfer to suggest replenishment But that heroine briefly suggesting Bedtime instead the bottles were put away and the family retired she cherubically escorted like some severe saint in a painting or merely human matron allegorically treated And by this time to morrow said Lavinia when the two girls were alone in their room we shall have mister Rokesmith here and shall be expecting to have our throats cut You needn t stand between me and the candle for all that retorted Bella This is another of the consequences of being poor The idea of a girl with a really fine head of hair having to do it by one flat candle and a few inches of looking glass You caught George Sampson with it Bella bad as your means of dressing it are You low little thing Caught George Sampson with it Don t talk about catching people miss till your own time for catching as you call it comes Perhaps it has come muttered Lavvy with a toss of her head What did you say asked Bella very sharply What did you say miss Lavvy declining equally to repeat or to explain Bella gradually lapsed over her hair dressing into a soliloquy on the miseries of being poor as exemplified in having nothing to put on nothing to go out in nothing to dress by only a nasty box to dress at instead of a commodious dressing table and being obliged to take in suspicious lodgers On the last grievance as her climax she laid great stress and might have laid greater had she known that if mister Julius Handford had a twin brother upon earth mister John Rokesmith was the man Chapter five BOFFIN S BOWER Over against a London house a corner house not far from Cavendish Square a man with a wooden leg had sat for some years with his remaining foot in a basket in cold weather picking up a living on this wise Every morning at eight o clock he stumped to the corner carrying a chair a clothes horse a pair of trestles a board a basket and an umbrella all strapped together Separating these the board and trestles became a counter the basket supplied the few small lots of fruit and sweets that he offered for sale upon it and became a foot warmer the unfolded clothes horse displayed a choice collection of halfpenny ballads and became a screen and the stool planted within it became his post for the rest of the day All weathers saw the man at the post This is to be accepted in a double sense for he contrived a back to his wooden stool by placing it against the lamp post When the weather was wet he put up his umbrella over his stock in trade not over himself when the weather was dry he furled that faded article tied it round with a piece of yarn and laid it cross wise under the trestles where it looked like an unwholesomely forced lettuce that had lost in colour and crispness what it had gained in size He had established his right to the corner by imperceptible prescription He had never varied his ground an inch but had in the beginning diffidently taken the corner upon which the side of the house gave A howling corner in the winter time a dusty corner in the summer time an undesirable corner at the best of times Shelterless fragments of straw and paper got up revolving storms there when the main street was at peace and the water cart as if it were drunk or short sighted came blundering and jolting round it making it muddy when all else was clean On the front of his sale board hung a little placard like a kettle holder bearing the inscription in his own small text Errands gone On with fi Delity By Ladies and Gentlemen I remain Your humble Servt Silas Wegg He had not only settled it with himself in course of time that he was errand goer by appointment to the house at the corner though he received such commissions not half a dozen times in a year and then only as some servant s deputy but also that he was one of the house s retainers and owed vassalage to it and was bound to leal and loyal interest in it For this reason he always spoke of it as Our House and though his knowledge of its affairs was mostly speculative and all wrong claimed to be in its confidence On similar grounds he never beheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat Yet he knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own invention as Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane Uncle Parker having no authority whatever for any such designations but particularly the last to which as a natural consequence he stuck with great obstinacy Over the house itself he exercised the same imaginary power as over its inhabitants and their affairs He had never been in it the length of a piece of fat black water pipe which trailed itself over the area door into a damp stone passage and had rather the air of a leech on the house that had taken wonderfully but this was no impediment to his arranging it according to a plan of his own It was a great dingy house with a quantity of dim side window and blank back premises and it cost his mind a world of trouble so to lay it out as to account for everything in its external appearance But this once done was quite satisfactory and he rested persuaded that he knew his way about the house blindfold from the barred garrets in the high roof to the two iron extinguishers before the main door which seemed to request all lively visitors to have the kindness to put themselves out before entering Assuredly this stall of Silas Wegg s was the hardest little stall of all the sterile little stalls in London It gave you the face ache to look at his apples the stomach ache to look at his oranges the tooth ache to look at his nuts Of the latter commodity he had always a grim little heap on which lay a little wooden measure which had no discernible inside and was considered to represent the penn orth appointed by Magna Charta Whether from too much east wind or no it was an easterly corner the stall the stock and the keeper were all as dry as the Desert Wegg was a knotty man and a close grained with a face carved out of very hard material that had just as much play of expression as a watchman s rattle When he laughed certain jerks occurred in it and the rattle sprung Sooth to say he was so wooden a man that he seemed to have taken his wooden leg naturally and rather suggested to the fanciful observer that he might be expected if his development received no untimely check to be completely set up with a pair of wooden legs in about six months mister Wegg was an observant person or as he himself said took a powerful sight of notice He saluted all his regular passers by every day as he sat on his stool backed up by the lamp post and on the adaptable character of these salutes he greatly plumed himself Thus to the rector he addressed a bow compounded of lay deference and a slight touch of the shady preliminary meditation at church to the doctor a confidential bow as to a gentleman whose acquaintance with his inside he begged respectfully to acknowledge before the Quality he delighted to abase himself and for Uncle Parker who was in the army at least so he had settled it he put his open hand to the side of his hat in a military manner which that angry eyed buttoned up inflammatory faced old gentleman appeared but imperfectly to appreciate The only article in which Silas dealt that was not hard was gingerbread On a certain day some wretched infant having purchased the damp gingerbread horse fearfully out of condition and the adhesive bird cage which had been exposed for the day s sale he had taken a tin box from under his stool to produce a relay of those dreadful specimens and was going to look in at the lid when he said to himself pausing Oh Here you are again The words referred to a broad round shouldered one sided old fellow in mourning coming comically ambling towards the corner dressed in a pea over coat and carrying a large stick He wore thick shoes and thick leather gaiters and thick gloves like a hedger s Both as to his dress and to himself he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build with folds in his cheeks and his forehead and his eyelids and his lips and his ears but with bright eager childishly inquiring grey eyes under his ragged eyebrows and broad brimmed hat A very odd looking old fellow altogether Here you are again repeated mister Wegg musing And what are you now Are you in the Funns or where are you Have you lately come to settle in this neighbourhood or do you own to another neighbourhood Are you in independent circumstances or is it wasting the motions of a bow on you Come I ll speculate I ll invest a bow in you Which mister Wegg having replaced his tin box accordingly did as he rose to bait his gingerbread trap for some other devoted infant The salute was acknowledged with

none	none	Morning Morning Calls me Sir said mister Wegg to himself HE won t answer A bow gone Morning morning morning Appears to be rather a arty old cock too said mister Wegg as before Good morning to YOU sir Do you remember me then asked his new acquaintance stopping in his amble one sided before the stall and speaking in a pounding way though with great good humour I have noticed you go past our house sir several times in the course of the last week or so Our house repeated the other Meaning Yes said mister Wegg nodding as the other pointed the clumsy forefinger of his right glove at the corner house Oh Now what pursued the old fellow in an inquisitive manner carrying his knotted stick in his left arm as if it were a baby what do they allow you now It s job work that I do for our house returned Silas drily and with reticence it s not yet brought to an exact allowance Oh It s not yet brought to an exact allowance No It s not yet brought to an exact allowance Oh Morning morning morning Appears to be rather a cracked old cock thought Silas qualifying his former good opinion as the other ambled off But in a moment he was back again with the question How did you get your wooden leg mister Wegg replied tartly to this personal inquiry In an accident
497_125118_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you like it 
none	none	Well I haven t got to keep it warm mister Wegg made answer in a sort of desperation occasioned by the singularity of the question
497_125118_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 He hasn t repeated the other to his knotted stick as he gave it a hug he hasn t got ha ha to keep it warm 
none	none	Did you ever hear of the name of Boffin No said mister Wegg who was growing restive under this examination

497_125118_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Think it over 
497_125118_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Nick or Noddy 
497_125118_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Noddy 
none	none	It is not sir mister Wegg rejoined as he sat down on his stool with an air of gentle resignation combined with melancholy candour it is not a name as I could wish any one that I had a respect for to call ME by but there may be persons that would not view it with the same objections I don t know why mister Wegg added anticipating another question Noddy Boffin said that gentleman Noddy 
497_125118_000045_000002	train-clean-360	That s my name 
497_125118_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Noddy or Nick Boffin 
497_125118_000045_000004	train-clean-360	What s your name 
none	none	Silas Wegg I don t said mister Wegg bestirring himself to take the same precaution as before I don t know why Silas and I don t know why Wegg Now Wegg said mister Boffin hugging his stick closer I want to make a sort of offer to you Do you remember when you first see me The wooden Wegg looked at him with a meditative eye and also with a softened air as descrying possibility of profit Let me think I ain t quite sure and yet I generally take a powerful sight of notice too Was it on a Monday morning when the butcher boy had been to our house for orders and bought a ballad of me which being unacquainted with the tune I run it over to him
497_125118_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Right Wegg right 
none	none	But he bought more than one Yes to be sure sir he bought several and wishing to lay out his money to the best he took my opinion to guide his choice and we went over the collection together To be sure we did Here was him as it might be and here was myself as it might be and there was you mister Boffin as you identically are with your self same stick under your very same arm and your very same back towards us To be sure added mister Wegg looking a little round mister Boffin to take him in the rear and identify this last extraordinary coincidence your wery self same back What do you think I was doing Wegg I should judge sir that you might be glancing your eye down the street No Wegg I was a listening Was you indeed said mister Wegg dubiously Not in a dishonourable way Wegg because you was singing to the butcher and you wouldn t sing secrets to a butcher in the street you know It never happened that I did so yet to the best of my remembrance said mister Wegg cautiously But I might do it A man can t say what he might wish to do some day or another This not to release any little advantage he might derive from mister Boffin s avowal Well repeated Boffin I was a listening to you and to him And what do you you haven t got another stool have you I m rather thick in my breath I haven t got another but you re welcome to this said Wegg resigning it It s a treat to me to stand Lard exclaimed mister Boffin in a tone of great enjoyment as he settled himself down still nursing his stick like a baby it s a pleasant place this And then to be shut in on each side with these ballads like so many book leaf blinkers 
497_125118_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Why its delightful 
none	none	If I am not mistaken sir mister Wegg delicately hinted resting a hand on his stall and bending over the discursive Boffin you alluded to some offer or another that was in your mind 
497_125118_000061_000002	train-clean-360	I m coming to it 
none	none	All right I m coming to it I was going to say that when I listened that morning I listened with hadmiration amounting to haw I thought to myself Here s a man with a wooden leg a literary man with N not exactly so sir said mister Wegg Why you know every one of these songs by name and by tune and if you want to read or to sing any one on em off straight you ve only to whip on your spectacles and do it cried mister Boffin I see you at it Well sir returned mister Wegg with a conscious inclination of the head we ll say literary then A literary man WITH a wooden leg and all Print is open to him That s what I thought to myself that morning pursued mister Boffin leaning forward to describe uncramped by the clotheshorse as large an arc as his right arm could make all Print is open to him And it is ain t it Why truly sir mister Wegg admitted with modesty I believe you couldn t show me the piece of English print that I wouldn t be equal to collaring and throwing On the spot said mister Boffin On the spot I know d it 
497_125118_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Then consider this 
none	none	Here am I a man without a wooden leg and yet all print is shut to me Indeed sir mister Wegg returned with increasing self complacency Education neglected Neg lected repeated Boffin with emphasis
497_125118_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 That ain t no word for it 
none	none	I don t mean to say but what if you showed me a B I could so far give you change for it as to answer Boffin Come come sir said mister Wegg throwing in a little encouragement that s something too It s something answered mister Boffin but I ll take my oath it ain t much Perhaps it s not as much as could be wished by an inquiring mind sir mister Wegg admitted
497_125118_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Now look here 
none	none	I m retired from business Me and missus Boffin Henerietty Boffin which her father s name was Henery and her mother s name was Hetty and so you get it we live on a compittance under the will of

none	none	Gentleman dead sir
497_125118_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Man alive don t I tell you 
none	none	A diseased governor Now it s too late for me to begin shovelling and sifting at alphabeds and grammar books I m getting to be a old bird and I want to take it easy But I want some reading some fine bold reading some splendid book in a gorging Lord Mayor s Show of wollumes probably meaning gorgeous but misled by association of ideas as ll reach right down your pint of view and take time to go by you How can I get that reading Wegg By tapping him on the breast with the head of his thick stick paying a man truly qualified to do it so much an hour say twopence to come and do it Hem Flattered sir I am sure said Wegg beginning to regard himself in quite a new light Hew This is the offer you mentioned sir Yes Do you like it I am considering of it mister Boffin I don t said Boffin in a free handed manner want to tie a literary man WITH a wooden leg down too tight A halfpenny an hour shan t part us The hours are your own to choose after you ve done for the day with your house here I live over Maiden Lane way out Holloway direction and you ve only got to go East and by North when you ve finished here and you re there Twopence halfpenny an hour said Boffin taking a piece of chalk from his pocket and getting off the stool to work the sum on the top of it in his own way two long uns and a short un twopence halfpenny two short uns is a long un and two two long uns is four long uns making five long uns six nights a week at five long uns a night scoring them all down separately and you mount up to thirty long uns A round un Half a crown Pointing to this result as a large and satisfactory one mister Boffin smeared it out with his moistened glove and sat down on the remains Half a crown said Wegg meditating Yes It ain t much sir Half a crown Per week you know Per week Yes As to the amount of strain upon the intellect now Was you thinking at all of poetry mister Wegg inquired musing
497_125118_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Would it come dearer mister Boffin asked 
none	none	It would come dearer mister Wegg returned For when a person comes to grind off poetry night after night it is but right he should expect to be paid for its weakening effect on his mind To tell you the truth Wegg said Boffin I wasn t thinking of poetry except in so fur as this If you was to happen now and then to feel yourself in the mind to tip me and missus Boffin one of your ballads why then we should drop into poetry I follow you sir said Wegg But not being a regular musical professional I should be loath to engage myself for that and therefore when I dropped into poetry I should ask to be considered so fur in the light of a friend At this mister Boffin s eyes sparkled and he shook Silas earnestly by the hand protesting that it was more than he could have asked and that he took it very kindly indeed What do you think of the terms Wegg mister Boffin then demanded with unconcealed anxiety Silas who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner and who had begun to understand his man very well replied with an air as if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great mister Boffin I never bargain So I should have thought of you said mister Boffin admiringly
1027_125147_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 No sir 
1027_125147_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 No sir

none	none	I never did aggle and I never will aggle Consequently I meet you at once free and fair with Done for double the money mister Boffin seemed a little unprepared for this conclusion but assented with the remark You know better what it ought to be than I do Wegg and again shook hands with him upon it Could you begin to night Wegg he then demanded Yes sir said mister Wegg careful to leave all the eagerness to him I see no difficulty if you wish it You are provided with the needful implement a book sir Bought him at a sale said mister Boffin Eight wollumes Red and gold Purple ribbon in every wollume to keep the place where you leave off Do you know him The book s name sir inquired Silas I thought you might have know d him without it said mister Boffin slightly disappointed His name is Decline And Fall Off The Rooshan Empire mister Boffin went over these stones slowly and with much caution Ay indeed said mister Wegg nodding his head with an air of friendly recognition You know him Wegg I haven t been not to say right slap through him very lately mister Wegg made answer having been otherways employed mister Boffin But know him Old familiar declining and falling off the Rooshan Rather sir Ever since I was not so high as your stick Ever since my eldest brother left our cottage to enlist into the army On which occasion as the ballad that was made about it describes Beside that cottage door mister Boffin A girl was on her knees She held aloft a snowy scarf Sir Which my eldest brother noticed fluttered in the breeze She breathed a prayer for him mister Boffin A prayer he coold not hear And my eldest brother lean d upon his sword mister Boffin And wiped away a tear Much impressed by this family circumstance and also by the friendly disposition of mister Wegg as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry mister Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper and besought him to name his hour mister Wegg named eight Where I live said mister Boffin is called The Bower Boffin s Bower is the name missus Boffin christened it when we come into it as a property If you should meet with anybody that don t know it by that name which hardly anybody does when you ve got nigh upon about a odd mile or say and a quarter if you like up Maiden Lane Battle Bridge ask for Harmony Jail and you ll be put right I shall expect you Wegg said mister Boffin clapping him on the shoulder with the greatest enthusiasm most joyfully 
497_125118_000106_000003	train-clean-360	I shall have no peace or patience till you come 
none	none	Print is now opening ahead of me This night a literary man WITH a wooden leg he bestowed an admiring look upon that decoration as if it greatly enhanced the relish of mister Wegg s attainments will begin to lead me a new life My fist again Wegg Morning morning morning Left alone at his stall as the other ambled off mister Wegg subsided into his screen produced a small pocket handkerchief of a penitentially scrubbing character and took himself by the nose with a thoughtful aspect Also while he still grasped that feature he directed several thoughtful looks down the street after the retiring figure of mister Boffin But profound gravity sat enthroned on Wegg s countenance For while he considered within himself that this was an old fellow of rare simplicity that this was an opportunity to be improved and that here might be money to be got beyond present calculation still he compromised himself by no admission that his new engagement was at all out of his way or involved the least element of the ridiculous mister Wegg would even have picked a handsome quarrel with any one who should have challenged his deep acquaintance with those aforesaid eight volumes of Decline and Fall His gravity was unusual portentous and immeasurable not because he admitted any doubt of himself but because he perceived it necessary to forestall any doubt of himself in others And herein he ranged with that very numerous class of impostors who are quite as determined to keep up appearances to themselves as to their neighbours A certain loftiness likewise took possession of mister Wegg a condescending sense of being in request as an official expounder of mysteries It did not move him to commercial greatness but rather to littleness insomuch that if it had been within the possibilities of things for the wooden measure to hold fewer nuts than usual it would have done so that day But when night came and with her veiled eyes beheld him stumping towards Boffin s Bower he was elated too The Bower was as difficult to find as Fair Rosamond s without the clue mister Wegg having reached the quarter indicated inquired for the Bower half a dozen times without the least success until he remembered to ask for Harmony Jail This occasioned a quick change in the spirits of a hoarse gentleman and a donkey whom he had much perplexed Why yer mean Old Harmon s do yer said the hoarse gentleman who was driving his donkey in a truck with a carrot for a whip Why didn t yer niver say so Eddard and me is a goin by HIM Jump in mister Wegg complied and the hoarse gentleman invited his attention to the third person in company thus Now you look at Eddard s ears What was it as you named agin Whisper mister Wegg whispered Boffin s Bower Eddard keep yer hi on his ears cut away to Boffin s Bower Edward with his ears lying back remained immoveable Eddard keep yer hi on his ears cut away to Old Harmon s Edward instantly pricked up his ears to their utmost and rattled off at such a pace that mister Wegg s conversation was jolted out of him in a most dislocated state Was it Ev verajail asked mister Wegg holding on Not a proper jail wot you and me would get committed to returned his escort they giv it the name on accounts of Old Harmon living solitary there And why did they callitharm Ony asked Wegg On accounts of his never agreeing with nobody Like a speeches of chaff Harmon s Jail Harmony Jail Working it round like Doyouknow Mist Erboff in asked Wegg I should think so Everybody do about here Eddard knows him Keep yer hi on his ears Noddy Boffin Eddard The effect of the name was so very alarming in respect of causing a temporary disappearance of Edward s head casting his hind hoofs in the air greatly accelerating the pace and increasing the jolting that mister Wegg was fain to devote his attention exclusively to holding on and to relinquish his desire of ascertaining whether this homage to Boffin was to be considered complimentary or the reverse Presently Edward stopped at a gateway and Wegg discreetly lost no time in slipping out at the back of the truck The moment he was landed his late driver with a wave of the carrot said Supper Eddard and he the hind hoofs the truck and Edward all seemed to fly into the air together in a kind of apotheosis Pushing the gate which stood ajar Wegg looked into an enclosed space where certain tall dark mounds rose high against the sky and where the pathway to the Bower was indicated as the moonlight showed between two lines of broken crockery set in ashes A white figure advancing along this path proved to be nothing more ghostly than mister Boffin easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge in an undress garment of short white smock frock Having received his literary friend with great cordiality he conducted him to the interior of the Bower and there presented him to missus Boffin a stout lady of a rubicund and cheerful aspect dressed to mister Wegg s consternation in a low evening dress of sable satin and a large black velvet hat and feathers missus Boffin Wegg said Boffin is a highflyer at Fashion And her make is such that she does it credit As to myself I ain t yet as Fash nable as I may come to be Henerietty old lady this is the gentleman that s a going to decline and fall off the Rooshan Empire And I am sure I hope it ll do you both good said missus Boffin It was the queerest of rooms fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg There were two wooden settles by the fire one on either side of it with a corresponding table before each On one of these tables the eight volumes were ranged flat in a row like a galvanic battery on the other certain squat case bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange glances with mister Wegg over a front row of tumblers and a basin of white sugar On the hob a kettle steamed on the hearth a cat reposed Facing the fire between the settles a sofa a footstool and a little table formed a centrepiece devoted to missus Boffin They were garish in taste and colour but were expensive articles of drawing room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling There was a flowery carpet on the floor but instead of reaching to the fireside its glowing vegetation stopped short at missus Boffin s footstool and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust mister Wegg also noticed with admiring eyes that while the flowery land displayed such hollow ornamentation as stuffed birds and waxen fruits under glass shades there were in the territory where vegetation ceased compensatory shelves on which the best part of a large pie and likewise of a cold joint were plainly discernible among other solids The room itself was large though low and the heavy frames of its old fashioned windows and the heavy beams in its crooked ceiling seemed to indicate that it had once been a house of some mark standing alone in the country Do you like it Wegg asked mister Boffin in his pouncing manner I admire it greatly sir said Wegg Peculiar comfort at this fireside sir Do you understand it Wegg Why in a general way sir mister Wegg was beginning slowly and knowingly with his head stuck on one side as evasive people do begin when the other cut him short You DON T understand it Wegg and I ll explain it These arrangements is made by mutual consent between missus Boffin and me missus Boffin as I ve mentioned is a highflyer at Fashion at present I m not I don t go higher than comfort and comfort of the sort that I m equal to the enjoyment of Well then Where would be the good of missus Boffin and me quarrelling over it We never did quarrel before we come into Boffin s Bower as a property why quarrel when we HAVE come into Boffin s Bower as a property So missus Boffin she keeps up her part of the room in her way I keep up my part of the room in mine In consequence of which we have at once Sociability I should go melancholy mad without missus Boffin Fashion and Comfort If I get by degrees to be a higher flyer at Fashion then missus Boffin will by degrees come for arder If missus Boffin should ever be less of a dab at Fashion than she is at the present time then missus Boffin s carpet would go back arder If we should both continny as we are why then HERE we are and give us a kiss old lady missus Boffin who perpetually smiling had approached and drawn her plump arm through her lord s most willingly complied Fashion in the form of her black velvet hat and feathers tried to prevent it but got deservedly crushed in the endeavour So now Wegg said mister Boffin wiping his mouth with an air of much refreshment you begin to know us as we are 
497_125118_000135_000001	train-clean-360	This is a charming spot is the Bower but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees 
none	none	It s a spot to find out the merits of little by little and a new un every day There s a serpentining walk up each of the mounds that gives you the yard and neighbourhood changing every moment When you get to the top there s a view of the neighbouring premises not to be surpassed The premises of missus Boffin s late father Canine Provision Trade you look down into as if they was your own And the top of the High Mound is crowned with a lattice work Arbour in which if you don t read out loud many a book in the summer ay and as a friend drop many a time into poetry too it shan t be my fault Now what ll you read on Thank you sir returned Wegg as if there were nothing new in his reading at all I generally do it on gin and water Keeps the organ moist does it Wegg asked mister Boffin with innocent eagerness N no sir replied Wegg coolly I should hardly describe it so sir I should say mellers it Mellers it is the word I should employ mister Boffin His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim The visions rising before his mercenary mind of the many ways in which this connexion was to be turned to account never obscured the foremost idea natural to a dull overreaching man that he must not make himself too cheap missus Boffin s Fashion as a less inexorable deity than the idol usually worshipped under that name did not forbid her mixing for her literary guest or asking if he found the result to his liking On his returning a gracious answer and taking his place at the literary settle mister Boffin began to compose himself as a listener at the opposite settle with exultant eyes
497_125118_000141_000000	train-clean-360	 Sorry to deprive you of a pipe Wegg he said filling his own but you can t do both together 
497_125118_000141_000001	train-clean-360	Oh and another thing I forgot to name 
none	none	When you come in here of an evening and look round you and notice anything on a shelf that happens to catch your fancy mention it Wegg who had been going to put on his spectacles immediately laid them down with the sprightly observation You read my thoughts sir DO my eyes deceive me or is that object up there a a pie It can t be a pie Yes it s a pie Wegg replied mister Boffin with a glance of some little discomfiture at the Decline and Fall HAVE I lost my smell for fruits or is it a apple pie sir asked Wegg It s a veal and ham pie said mister Boffin Is it indeed sir And it would be hard sir to name the pie that is a better pie than a weal and hammer said mister Wegg nodding his head emotionally Have some Wegg Thank you mister Boffin I think I will at your invitation I wouldn t at any other party s at the present juncture but at yours sir And meaty jelly too especially when a little salt which is the case where there s ham is mellering to the organ is very mellering to the organ mister Wegg did not say what organ but spoke with a cheerful generality So the pie was brought down and the worthy mister Boffin exercised his patience until Wegg in the exercise of his knife and fork had finished the dish only profiting by the opportunity to inform Wegg that although it was not strictly Fashionable to keep the contents of a larder thus exposed to view he mister Boffin considered it hospitable for the reason that instead of saying in a comparatively unmeaning manner to a visitor There are such and such edibles down stairs will you have anything up you took the bold practical course of saying Cast your eye along the shelves and if you see anything you like there have it down And now mister Wegg at length pushed away his plate and put on his spectacles and mister Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming eyes into the opening world before him and missus Boffin reclined in a fashionable manner on her sofa as one who would be part of the audience if she found she could and would go to sleep if she found she couldn t Hem began Wegg This mister Boffin and Lady is the first chapter of the first wollume of the Decline and Fall off here he looked hard at the book and stopped What s the matter Wegg Why it comes into my mind do you know sir said Wegg with an air of insinuating frankness having first again looked hard at the book that you made a little mistake this morning which I had meant to set you right in only something put it out of my head I think you said Rooshan Empire sir It is Rooshan ain t it Wegg No sir Roman Roman What s the difference Wegg The difference sir mister Wegg was faltering and in danger of breaking down when a bright thought flashed upon him The difference sir There you place me in a difficulty mister Boffin Suffice it to observe that the difference is best postponed to some other occasion when missus Boffin does not honour us with her company In missus Boffin s presence sir we had better drop it mister Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air and not only that but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy In missus Boffin s presence sir we had better drop it turned the disadvantage on Boffin who felt that he had committed himself in a very painful manner Then mister Wegg in a dry unflinching way entered on his task going straight across country at everything that came before him taking all the hard words biographical and geographical getting rather shaken by Hadrian Trajan and the Antonines stumbling at Polybius pronounced Polly Beeious and supposed by mister Boffin to be a Roman virgin and by missus Boffin to be responsible for that necessity of dropping it heavily unseated by Titus Antoninus Pius up again and galloping smoothly with Augustus finally getting over the ground well with Commodus who under the appellation of Commodious was held by mister Boffin to have been quite unworthy of his English origin and not to have acted up to his name in his government of the Roman people With the death of this personage mister Wegg terminated his first reading long before which consummation several total eclipses of missus Boffin s candle behind her black velvet disc would have been very alarming but for being regularly accompanied by a potent smell of burnt pens when her feathers took fire which acted as a restorative and woke her mister Wegg having read on by rote and attached as few ideas as possible to the text came out of the encounter fresh but mister Boffin who had soon laid down his unfinished pipe and had ever since sat intently staring with his eyes and mind at the confounding enormities of the Romans was so severely punished that he could hardly wish his literary friend Good night and articulate Tomorrow Commodious gasped mister Boffin staring at the moon after letting Wegg out at the gate and fastening it Commodious fights in that wild beast show seven hundred and thirty five times in one character only As if that wasn t stunning enough a hundred lions is turned into the same wild beast show all at once As if that wasn t stunning enough Commodious in another character kills em all off in a hundred goes As if that wasn t stunning enough Vittle us and well named too eats six millions worth English money in seven months Wegg takes it easy but upon my soul to a old bird like myself these are scarers And even now that Commodious is strangled I don t see a way to our bettering ourselves mister Boffin added as he turned his pensive steps towards the Bower and shook his head I didn t think this morning there was half so many Scarers in Print But I m in for it now Chapter six CUT ADRIFT The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters already mentioned as a tavern of a dropsical appearance had long settled down into a state of hale infirmity In its whole constitution it had not a straight floor and hardly a straight line but it had outlasted and clearly would yet outlast many a better trimmed building many a sprucer public house Externally it was a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another as you might heap as many toppling oranges with a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water indeed the whole house inclusive of the complaining flag staff on the roof impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he will never go in at all This description applies to the river frontage of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters The back of the establishment though the chief entrance was there so contracted that it merely represented in its connexion with the front the handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end This handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court and alley which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond its door For this reason in combination with the fact that the house was all but afloat at high water when the Porters had a family wash the linen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines stretched across the reception rooms and bed chambers The wood forming the chimney pieces beams partitions floors and doors of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters seemed in its old age fraught with confused memories of its youth In many places it had become gnarled and riven according to the manner of old trees knots started out of it and here and there it seemed to twist itself into some likeness of boughs In this state of second childhood it had an air of being in its own way garrulous about its early life Not without reason was it often asserted by the regular frequenters of the Porters that when the light shone full upon the grain of certain panels and particularly upon an old corner cupboard of walnut wood in the bar you might trace little forests there and tiny trees like the parent tree in full umbrageous leaf The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters was a bar to soften the human breast The available space in it was not much larger than a hackney coach but no one could have wished the bar bigger that space was so girt in by corpulent little casks and by cordial bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches and by lemons in nets and by biscuits in baskets and by the polite beer pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer and by the cheese in a snug corner and by the landlady s own small table in a snugger corner near the fire with the cloth everlastingly laid This haven was divided from the rough world by a glass partition and a half door with a leaden sill upon it for the convenience of resting your liquor but over this half door the bar s snugness so gushed forth that albeit customers drank there standing in a dark and draughty passage where they were shouldered by other customers passing in and out they always appeared to drink under an enchanting delusion that they were in the bar itself For the rest both the tap and parlour of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters gave upon the river and had red curtains matching the noses of the regular customers and were provided with comfortable fireside tin utensils like models of sugar loaf hats made in that shape that they might with their pointed ends seek out for themselves glowing nooks in the depths of the red coals when they mulled your ale or heated for you those delectable drinks Purl Flip and Dog s Nose The first of these humming compounds was a speciality of the Porters which through an inscription on its door posts gently appealed to your feelings as The Early Purl House For it would seem that Purl must always be taken early though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that as the early bird catches the worm so the early purl catches the customer cannot here be resolved It only remains to add that in the handle of the flat iron and opposite the bar was a very little room like a three cornered hat into which no direct ray of sun moon or star ever penetrated but which was superstitiously regarded as a sanctuary replete with comfort and retirement by gaslight and on the door of which was therefore painted its alluring name Cosy Miss Potterson sole proprietor and manager of the Fellowship Porters reigned supreme on her throne the Bar and a man must have drunk himself mad drunk indeed if he thought he could contest a point with her Being known on her own authority as Miss Abbey Potterson some water side heads which like the water were none of the clearest harboured muddled notions that because of her dignity and firmness she was named after or in some sort related to the Abbey at Westminster But Abbey was only short for Abigail by which name Miss Potterson had been christened at Limehouse Church some sixty and odd years before Now you mind you Riderhood said Miss Abbey Potterson with emphatic forefinger over the half door the Fellowship don t want you at all and would rather by far have your room than your company but if you were as welcome here as you are not you shouldn t even then have another drop of drink here this night after this present pint of beer So make the most of it But you know Miss Potterson this was suggested very meekly though if I behave myself you can t help serving me miss CAN T I said Abbey with infinite expression No Miss Potterson because you see the law I am the law here my man returned Miss Abbey and I ll soon convince you of that if you doubt it at all I never said I did doubt it at all Miss Abbey So much the better for you Abbey the supreme threw the customer s halfpence into the till and seating herself in her fireside chair resumed the newspaper she had been reading She was a tall upright well favoured woman though severe of countenance and had more of the air of a schoolmistress than mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters The man on the other side of the half door was a waterside man with a squinting leer and he eyed her as if he were one of her pupils in disgrace You re cruel hard upon me Miss Potterson Miss Potterson read her newspaper with contracted brows and took no notice until he whispered Miss Potterson Ma am Might I have half a word with you Deigning then to turn her eyes sideways towards the suppliant Miss Potterson beheld him knuckling his low forehead and ducking at her with his head as if he were asking leave to fling himself head foremost over the half door and alight on his feet in the bar Well said Miss Potterson with a manner as short as she herself was long say your half word Bring it out Miss Potterson Ma am Would you sxcuse me taking the liberty of asking is it my character that you take objections to Certainly said Miss Potterson Is it that you re afraid of I am not afraid OF YOU interposed Miss Potterson if you mean that But I humbly don t mean that Miss Abbey Then what do you mean You really are so cruel hard upon me What I was going to make inquiries was no more than might you have any apprehensions leastways beliefs or suppositions that the company s property mightn t be altogether to be considered safe if I used the house too regular What do you want to know for Well Miss Abbey respectfully meaning no offence to you it would be some satisfaction to a man s mind to understand why the Fellowship Porters is not to be free to such as me and is to be free to such as Gaffer The face of the hostess darkened with some shadow of perplexity as she replied Gaffer has never been where you have been Signifying in Quod Miss Perhaps not But he may have merited it He may be suspected of far worse than ever I was Who suspects him Many perhaps One beyond all doubts I do YOU are not much said Miss Abbey Potterson knitting her brows again with disdain But I was his pardner Mind you Miss Abbey I was his pardner As such I know more of the ins and outs of him than any person living does Notice this I am the man that was his pardner and I am the man that suspects him Then suggested Miss Abbey though with a deeper shade of perplexity than before you criminate yourself No I don t Miss Abbey For how does it stand It stands this way When I was his pardner I couldn t never give him satisfaction Why couldn t I never give him satisfaction Because my luck was bad because I couldn t find many enough of em How was his luck Always good Notice this Always good Ah There s a many games Miss Abbey in which there s chance but there s a many others in which there s skill too mixed along with it That Gaffer has a skill in finding what he finds who doubts man asked Miss Abbey A skill in purwiding what he finds perhaps said Riderhood shaking his evil head Miss Abbey knitted her brow at him as he darkly leered at her If you re out upon the river pretty nigh every tide and if you want to find a man or woman in the river you ll greatly help your luck Miss Abbey by knocking a man or woman on the head aforehand and pitching em in Gracious Lud was the involuntary exclamation of Miss Potterson Mind you returned the other stretching forward over the half door to throw his words into the bar for his voice was as if the head of his boat s mop were down his throat I say so Miss Abbey And mind you I ll follow him up Miss Abbey And mind you I ll bring him to hook at last if it s twenty year hence I will Who s he to be favoured along of his daughter Ain t I got a daughter of my own With that flourish and seeming to have talked himself rather more drunk and much more ferocious than he had begun by being mister Riderhood took up his pint pot and swaggered off to the taproom Gaffer was not there but a pretty strong muster of Miss Abbey s pupils were who exhibited when occasion required the greatest docility On the clock s striking ten and Miss Abbey s appearing at the door and addressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket with George Jones your time s up I told your wife you should be punctual Jones submissively rose gave the company good night and retired At half past ten on Miss Abbey s looking in again and saying William Williams Bob Glamour and Jonathan you are all due Williams Bob and Jonathan with similar meekness took their leave and evaporated Greater wonder than these when a bottle nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy and when Miss Abbey instead of sending it appeared in person saying Captain Joey you have had as much as will do you good not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest but the rest of the company murmured Ay ay Captain Miss Abbey s right you be guided by Miss Abbey Captain Nor was Miss Abbey s vigilance in anywise abated by this submission but rather sharpened for looking round on the deferential faces of her school and descrying two other young persons in need of admonition she thus bestowed it Tom Tootle it s time for a young fellow who s going to be married next month to be at home and asleep And you needn t nudge him mister Jack Mullins for I know your work begins early tomorrow and I say the same to you So come Good night like good lads Upon which the blushing Tootle looked to Mullins and the blushing Mullins looked to Tootle on the question who should rise first and finally both rose together and went out on the broad grin followed by Miss Abbey in whose presence the company did not take the liberty of grinning likewise In such an establishment the white aproned pot boy with his shirt sleeves arranged in a tight roll on each bare shoulder was a mere hint of the possibility of physical force thrown out as a matter of state and form Exactly at the closing hour all the guests who were left filed out in the best order Miss Abbey standing at the half door of the bar to hold a ceremony of review and dismissal All wished Miss Abbey good night and Miss Abbey wished good night to all except Riderhood The sapient pot boy looking on officially then had the conviction borne in upon his soul that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters You Bob Gliddery said Miss Abbey to this pot boy run round to Hexam s and tell his daughter Lizzie that I want to speak to her With exemplary swiftness Bob Gliddery departed and returned Lizzie following him arrived as one of the two female domestics of the Fellowship Porters arranged on the snug little table by the bar fire Miss Potterson s supper of hot sausages and mashed potatoes Come in and sit ye down girl said Miss Abbey Can you eat a bit No thank you Miss I have had my supper I have had mine too I think said Miss Abbey pushing away the untasted dish and more than enough of it I am put out Lizzie I am very sorry for it Miss Then why in the name of Goodness quoth Miss Abbey sharply do you do it I do it Miss There there Don t look astonished I ought to have begun with a word of explanation but it s my way to make short cuts at things I always was a pepperer You Bob Gliddery there put the chain upon the door and get ye down to your supper With an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact than to the supper fact Bob obeyed and his boots were heard descending towards the bed of the river Lizzie Hexam Lizzie Hexam then began Miss Potterson how often have I held out to you the opportunity of getting clear of your father and doing well Very often Miss Very often Yes And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of the strongest sea going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters No Miss Lizzie pleaded because that would not be thankful and I am I vow and declare I am half ashamed of myself for taking such an interest in you said Miss Abbey pettishly for I don t believe I should do it if you were not good looking Why ain t you ugly Lizzie merely answered this difficult question with an apologetic glance However you ain t resumed Miss Potterson so it s no use going into that I must take you as I find you Which indeed is what I ve done And you mean to say you are still obstinate Not obstinate Miss I hope Firm I suppose you call it then Yes Miss Fixed like Never was an obstinate person yet who would own to the word remarked Miss Potterson rubbing her vexed nose I m sure I would if I was obstinate but I am a pepperer which is different Lizzie Hexam Lizzie Hexam think again Do you know the worst of your father
1027_125140_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Do I 
none	none	know the worst of father she repeated opening her eyes Do you know the suspicions to which your father makes himself liable Do you know the suspicions that are actually about against him The consciousness of what he habitually did oppressed the girl heavily and she slowly cast down her eyes Say Lizzie Do you know urged Miss Abbey Please to tell me what the suspicions are Miss she asked after a silence with her eyes upon the ground It s not an easy thing to tell a daughter but it must be told It is thought by some then that your father helps to their death a few of those that he finds dead The relief of hearing what she felt sure was a false suspicion in place of the expected real and true one so lightened Lizzie s breast for the moment that Miss Abbey was amazed at her demeanour She raised her eyes quickly shook her head and in a kind of triumph almost laughed They little know father who talk like that She takes it thought Miss Abbey very quietly She takes it with extraordinary quietness And perhaps said Lizzie as a recollection flashed upon her it is some one who has a grudge against father some one who has threatened father Is it Riderhood Miss Well yes it is Yes He was father s partner and father broke with him and now he revenges himself Father broke with him when I was by and he was very angry at it And besides Miss Abbey Will you never without strong reason let pass your lips what I am going to say She bent forward to say it in a whisper I promise said Miss Abbey It was on the night when the Harmon murder was found out through father just above bridge And just below bridge as we were sculling home Riderhood crept out of the dark in his boat And many and many times afterwards when such great pains were taken to come to the bottom of the crime and it never could be come near I thought in my own thoughts could Riderhood himself have done the murder and did he purposely let father find the body It seemed a most wicked and cruel to so much as think such a thing but now that he tries to throw it upon father I go back to it as if it was a truth Can it be a truth That was put into my mind by the dead She asked this question rather of the fire than of the hostess of the Fellowship Porters and looked round the little bar with troubled eyes But Miss Potterson as a ready schoolmistress accustomed to bring her pupils to book set the matter in a light that was essentially of this world You poor deluded girl she said don t you see that you can t open your mind to particular suspicions of one of the two without opening your mind to general suspicions of the other They had worked together Their goings on had been going on for some time Even granting that it was as you have had in your thoughts what the two had done together would come familiar to the mind of one You don t know father Miss when you talk like that Indeed indeed you don t know father Lizzie Lizzie said Miss Potterson Leave him You needn t break with him altogether but leave him Do well away from him not because of what I have told you to night we ll pass no judgment upon that and we ll hope it may not be but because of what I have urged on you before No matter whether it s owing to your good looks or not I like you and I want to serve you Lizzie come under my direction Don t fling yourself away my girl but be persuaded into being respectable and happy In the sound good feeling and good sense of her entreaty Miss Abbey had softened into a soothing tone and had even drawn her arm round the girl s waist But she only replied Thank you thank you I can t I won t I must not think of it The harder father is borne upon the more he needs me to lean on And then Miss Abbey who like all hard people when they do soften felt that there was considerable compensation owing to her underwent reaction and became frigid I have done what I can she said and you must go your way You make your bed and you must lie on it But tell your father one thing he must not come here any more Oh Miss will you forbid him the house where I know he s safe The Fellowships returned Miss Abbey has itself to look to as well as others It has been hard work to establish order here and make the Fellowships what it is and it is daily and nightly hard work to keep it so The Fellowships must not have a taint upon it that may give it a bad name I forbid the house to Riderhood and I forbid the house to Gaffer I forbid both equally I find from Riderhood and you together that there are suspicions against both men and I m not going to take upon myself to decide betwixt them They are both tarred with a dirty brush and I can t have the Fellowships tarred with the same brush That s all I know Good night Miss said Lizzie Hexam sorrowfully Hah Good night returned Miss Abbey with a shake of her head Believe me Miss Abbey I am truly grateful all the same I can believe a good deal returned the stately Abbey so I ll try to believe that too Lizzie No supper did Miss Potterson take that night and only half her usual tumbler of hot Port Negus And the female domestics two robust sisters with staring black eyes shining flat red faces blunt noses and strong black curls like dolls interchanged the sentiment that Missis had had her hair combed the wrong way by somebody And the pot boy afterwards remarked that he hadn t been so rattled to bed since his late mother had systematically accelerated his retirement to rest with a poker The chaining of the door behind her as she went forth disenchanted Lizzie Hexam of that first relief she had felt The night was black and shrill the river side wilderness was melancholy and there was a sound of casting out in the rattling of the iron links and the grating of the bolts and staples under Miss Abbey s hand As she came beneath the lowering sky a sense of being involved in a murky shade of Murder dropped upon her and as the tidal swell of the river broke at her feet without her seeing how it gathered so her thoughts startled her by rushing out of an unseen void and striking at her heart Of her father s being groundlessly suspected she felt sure Sure Sure And yet repeat the word inwardly as often as she would the attempt to reason out and prove that she was sure always came after it and failed Riderhood had done the deed and entrapped her father Riderhood had not done the deed but had resolved in his malice to turn against her father the appearances that were ready to his hand to distort Equally and swiftly upon either putting of the case followed the frightful possibility that her father being innocent yet might come to be believed guilty She had heard of people suffering Death for bloodshed of which they were afterwards proved pure and those ill fated persons were not first in that dangerous wrong in which her father stood Then at the best the beginning of his being set apart whispered against and avoided was a certain fact It dated from that very night And as the great black river with its dreary shores was soon lost to her view in the gloom so she stood on the river s brink unable to see into the vast blank misery of a life suspected and fallen away from by good and bad but knowing that it lay there dim before her stretching away to the great ocean Death One thing only was clear to the girl s mind Accustomed from her very babyhood promptly to do the thing that could be done whether to keep out weather to ward off cold to postpone hunger or what not she started out of her meditation and ran home The room was quiet and the lamp burnt on the table In the bunk in the corner her brother lay asleep She bent over him softly kissed him and came to the table By the time of Miss Abbey s closing and by the run of the tide it must be one Tide s running up Father at Chiswick wouldn t think of coming down till after the turn and that s at half after four I ll call Charley at six I shall hear the church clocks strike as I sit here Very quietly she placed a chair before the scanty fire and sat down in it drawing her shawl about her Charley s hollow down by the flare is not there now Poor Charley The clock struck two and the clock struck three and the clock struck four and she remained there with a woman s patience and her own purpose When the morning was well on between four and five she slipped off her shoes that her going about might not wake Charley trimmed the fire sparingly put water on to boil and set the table for breakfast Then she went up the ladder lamp in hand and came down again and glided about and about making a little bundle Lastly from her pocket and from the chimney piece and from an inverted basin on the highest shelf she brought halfpence a few sixpences fewer shillings and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting them and setting aside one little heap She was still so engaged when she was startled by Hal loa From her brother sitting up in bed You made me jump Charley Jump Didn t you make ME jump when I opened my eyes a moment ago and saw you sitting there like the ghost of a girl miser in the dead of the night It s not the dead of the night Charley It s nigh six in the morning Is it though But

501_125128_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 that s it 
none	none	said the boy What are you putting that little pile of money by itself for For you Charley What do you mean Get out of bed Charley and get washed and dressed and then I ll tell you Her composed manner and her low distinct voice always had an influence over him His head was soon in a basin of water and out of it again and staring at her through a storm of towelling I never towelling at himself as if he were his bitterest enemy saw such a girl as you are What IS the move Liz Are you almost ready for breakfast Charley You can pour it out Hal loa I say And a bundle And a bundle Charley You don t mean it s for me too Yes Charley I do indeed More serious of face and more slow of action than he had been the boy completed his dressing and came and sat down at the little breakfast table with his eyes amazedly directed to her face You see Charley dear I have made up my mind that this is the right time for your going away from us Over and above all the blessed change of by and bye you ll be much happier and do much better even so soon as next month Even so soon as next week How do you know I shall I don t quite know how Charley but I do In spite of her unchanged manner of speaking and her unchanged appearance of composure she scarcely trusted herself to look at him but kept her eyes employed on the cutting and buttering of his bread and on the mixing of his tea and other such little preparations You must leave father to me Charley I will do what I can with him but you must go You don t stand upon ceremony I think grumbled the boy throwing his bread and butter about in an ill humour She made him no answer I tell you what said the boy then bursting out into an angry whimpering you re a selfish jade and you think there s not enough for three of us and you want to get rid of me If you believe so Charley yes then I believe too that I am a selfish jade and that I think there s not enough for three of us and that I want to get rid of you It was only when the boy rushed at her and threw his arms round her neck that she lost her self restraint But she lost it then and wept over him Don t cry don t cry I am satisfied to go Liz I am satisfied to go I know you send me away for my good O Charley Charley Heaven above us knows I do Yes yes Don t mind what I said Don t remember it Kiss me After a silence she loosed him to dry her eyes and regain her strong quiet influence Now listen Charley dear We both know it must be done and I alone know there is good reason for its being done at once Go straight to the school and say that you and I agreed upon it that we can t overcome father s opposition that father will never trouble them but will never take you back You are a credit to the school and you will be a greater credit to it yet and they will help you to get a living Show what clothes you have brought and what money and say that I will send some more money If I can get some in no other way I will ask a little help of those two gentlemen who came here that night I say cried her brother quickly Don t you have it of that chap that took hold of me by the chin Don t you have it of that Wrayburn one Perhaps a slight additional tinge of red flushed up into her face and brow as with a nod she laid a hand upon his lips to keep him silently attentive And above all things mind this Charley Be sure you always speak well of father Be sure you always give father his full due You can t deny that because father has no learning himself he is set against it in you but favour nothing else against him and be sure you say as you know that your sister is devoted to him And if you should ever happen to hear anything said against father that is new to you it will not be true Remember Charley It will not be true The boy looked at her with some doubt and surprise but she went on again without heeding it Above all things remember It will not be true I have nothing more to say Charley dear except be good and get learning and only think of some things in the old life here as if you had dreamed them in a dream last night

none	none	my Darling Though so young she infused in these parting words a love that was far more like a mother s than a sister s and before which the boy was quite bowed down After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry he took up his bundle and darted out at the door with an arm across his eyes The white face of the winter day came sluggishly on veiled in a frosty mist and the shadowy ships in the river slowly changed to black substances and the sun blood red on the eastern marshes behind dark masts and yards seemed filled with the ruins of a forest it had set on fire Lizzie looking for her father saw him coming and stood upon the causeway that he might see her He had nothing with him but his boat and came on apace A knot of those amphibious human creatures who appear to have some mysterious power of extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it were gathered together about the causeway As her father s boat grounded they became contemplative of the mud and dispersed themselves She saw that the mute avoidance had begun Gaffer saw it too in so far as that he was moved when he set foot on shore to stare around him But he promptly set to work to haul up his boat and make her fast and take the sculls and rudder and rope out of her Carrying these with Lizzie s aid he passed up to his dwelling Sit close to the fire father dear while I cook your breakfast It s all ready for cooking and only been waiting for you You must be frozen Well Lizzie I ain t of a glow that s certain And my hands seem nailed through to the sculls See how dead they are Something suggestive in their colour and perhaps in her face struck him as he held them up he turned his shoulder and held them down to the fire You were not out in the perishing night I hope father No my dear Lay aboard a barge by a blazing coal fire Where s that boy There s a drop of brandy for your tea father if you ll put it in while I turn this bit of meat If the river was to get frozen there would be a deal of distress wouldn t there father Ah there s always enough of that said Gaffer dropping the liquor into his cup from a squat black bottle and dropping it slowly that it might seem more distress is for ever a going about like sut in the air Ain t that boy up yet The meat s ready now father Eat it while it s hot and comfortable After you have finished we ll turn round to the fire and talk But he perceived that he was evaded and having thrown a hasty angry glance towards the bunk plucked at a corner of her apron and asked What s gone with that boy Father if you ll begin your breakfast I ll sit by and tell you He looked at her stirred his tea and took two or three gulps then cut at his piece of hot steak with his case knife and said eating Now then What s gone with that boy Don t be angry dear It seems father that he has quite a gift of learning Unnat ral young beggar said the parent shaking his knife in the air And that having this gift and not being equally good at other things he has made shift to get some schooling Unnat ral young beggar said the parent again with his former action And that knowing you have nothing to spare father and not wishing to be a burden on you he gradually made up his mind to go seek his fortune out of learning He went away this morning father and he cried very much at going and he hoped you would forgive him Let him never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness said the father again emphasizing his words with the knife Let him never come within sight of my eyes nor yet within reach of my arm His own father ain t good enough for him He s disowned his own father His own father therefore disowns him for ever and ever as a unnat ral young beggar He had pushed away his plate With the natural need of a strong rough man in anger to do something forcible he now clutched his knife overhand and struck downward with it at the end of every succeeding sentence As he would have struck with his own clenched fist if there had chanced to be nothing in it He s welcome to go He s more welcome to go than to stay But let him never come back Let him never put his head inside that door And let you never speak a word more in his favour or you ll disown your own father likewise and what your father says of him he ll have to come to say of you Now I see why them men yonder held aloof from me They says to one another Here comes the man as ain t good enough for his own son Lizzie But she stopped him with a cry Looking at her he saw her with a face quite strange to him shrinking back against the wall with her hands before her eyes Father don t I can t bear to see you striking with it Put it down He looked at the knife but in his astonishment still held it Father it s too horrible O put it down put it down Confounded by her appearance and exclamation he tossed it away and stood up with his open hands held out before him What s come to you Liz Can you think I would strike at you with a knife No father no you would never hurt me What should I hurt Nothing dear father On my knees I am certain in my heart and soul I am certain nothing But it was too dreadful to bear for it looked her hands covering her face again O it looked What did it look like The recollection of his murderous figure combining with her trial of last night and her trial of the morning caused her to drop at his feet without having answered He had never seen her so before He raised her with the utmost tenderness calling her the best of daughters and my poor pretty creetur and laid her head upon his knee and tried to restore her But failing he laid her head gently down again got a pillow and placed it under her dark hair and sought on the table for a spoonful of brandy There being none left he hurriedly caught up the empty bottle and ran out at the door He returned as hurriedly as he had gone with the bottle still empty He kneeled down by her took her head on his arm and moistened her lips with a little water into which he dipped his fingers saying fiercely as he looked around now over this shoulder now over that Have we got a pest in the house Is there summ at deadly sticking to my clothes What s let loose upon us Who loosed it Chapter seven mister WEGG LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF Silas Wegg being on his road to the Roman Empire approaches it by way of Clerkenwell The time is early in the evening the weather moist and raw mister Wegg finds leisure to make a little circuit by reason that he folds his screen early now that he combines another source of income with it and also that he feels it due to himself to be anxiously expected at the Bower Boffin will get all the eagerer for waiting a bit says Silas screwing up as he stumps along first his right eye and then his left Which is something superfluous in him for Nature has already screwed both pretty tight If I get on with him as I expect to get on Silas pursues stumping and meditating it wouldn t become me to leave it here It wouldn t he respectable Animated by this reflection he stumps faster and looks a long way before him as a man with an ambitious project in abeyance often will do Aware of a working jeweller population taking sanctuary about the church in Clerkenwell mister Wegg is conscious of an interest in and a respect for the neighbourhood But his sensations in this regard halt as to their strict morality as he halts in his gait for they suggest the delights of a coat of invisibility in which to walk off safely with the precious stones and watch cases but stop short of any compunction for the people who would lose the same Not however towards the shops where cunning artificers work in pearls and diamonds and gold and silver making their hands so rich that the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the refiners not towards these does mister Wegg stump but towards the poorer shops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm and of Italian frame makers and of barbers and of brokers and of dealers in dogs and singing birds From these in a narrow and a dirty street devoted to such callings mister Wegg selects one dark shop window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it surrounded by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick but among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct save the candle itself in its old tin candlestick and two preserved frogs fighting a small sword duel Stumping with fresh vigour he goes in at the dark greasy entry pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side door and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop It is so dark that nothing can be made out in it over a little counter but another tallow candle in another old tin candlestick close to the face of a man stooping low in a chair mister Wegg nods to the face Good evening The face looking up is a sallow face with weak eyes surmounted by a tangle of reddish dusty hair The owner of the face has no cravat on and has opened his tumbled shirt collar to work with the more ease For the same reason he has no coat on only a loose waistcoat over his yellow linen His eyes are like the over tried eyes of an engraver but he is not that his expression and stoop are like those of a shoemaker but he is not that Good evening mister Venus Don t you remember With slowly dawning remembrance mister Venus rises and holds his candle over the little counter and holds it down towards the legs natural and artificial of mister Wegg To be SURE he says then How do you do Wegg you know that gentleman explains Yes yes says the other Hospital amputation Just so says mister Wegg Yes yes quoth Venus How do you do Sit down by the fire and warm your your other one The little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the fireplace which would have been behind it if it had been longer accessible mister Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire and inhales a warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop For that mister Wegg inwardly decides as he takes a corrective sniff or two is musty leathery feathery cellary gluey gummy and with another sniff as it might be strong of old pairs of bellows My tea is drawing and my muffin is on the hob mister Wegg will you partake It being one of mister Wegg s guiding rules in life always to partake he says he will But the little shop is so excessively dark is stuck so full of black shelves and brackets and nooks and corners that he sees mister Venus s cup and saucer only because it is close under the candle and does not see from what mysterious recess mister Venus produces another for himself until it is under his nose Concurrently Wegg perceives a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter with its head drooping on one side against the rim of mister Venus s saucer and a long stiff wire piercing its breast As if it were Cock Robin the hero of the ballad and mister Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow and mister Wegg were the fly with his little eye mister Venus dives and produces another muffin yet untoasted taking the arrow out of the breast of Cock Robin he proceeds to toast it on the end of that cruel instrument When it is brown he dives again and produces butter with which he completes his work mister Wegg as an artful man who is sure of his supper by and bye presses muffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind or as one might say to grease his works As the muffins disappear little by little the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear and mister Wegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the chimney piece is a Hindoo baby in a bottle curved up with his big head tucked under him as he would instantly throw a summersault if the bottle were large enough When he deems mister Venus s wheels sufficiently lubricated mister Wegg approaches his object by asking as he lightly taps his hands together to express an undesigning frame of mind And how have I been going on this long time mister Venus Very bad says mister Venus uncompromisingly What Am I still at home asks Wegg with an air of surprise Always at home This would seem to be secretly agreeable to Wegg but he veils his feelings and observes Strange To what do you attribute it I don t know replies Venus who is a haggard melancholy man speaking in a weak voice of querulous complaint to what to attribute it mister Wegg I can t work you into a miscellaneous one no how Do what I will you can t be got to fit Anybody with a passable knowledge would pick you out at a look and say No go Don t match Well but hang it mister Venus Wegg expostulates with some little irritation that can t be personal and peculiar in ME It must often happen with miscellaneous ones With ribs I grant you always But not else When I prepare a miscellaneous one I know beforehand that I can t keep to nature and be miscellaneous with ribs because every man has his own ribs and no other man s will go with them but elseways I can be miscellaneous I have just sent home a Beauty a perfect Beauty to a school of art One leg Belgian one leg English and the pickings of eight other people in it Talk of not being qualified to be miscellaneous By rights you OUGHT to be mister Wegg Silas looks as hard at his one leg as he can in the dim light and after a pause sulkily opines that it must be the fault of the other people Or how do you mean to say it comes about he demands impatiently I don t know how it comes about Stand up a minute Hold the light mister Venus takes from a corner by his chair the bones of a leg and foot beautifully pure and put together with exquisite neatness These he compares with mister Wegg s leg that gentleman looking on as if he were being measured for a riding boot No I don t know how it is but so it is You have got a twist in that bone to the best of my belief I never saw the likes of you mister Wegg having looked distrustfully at his own limb and suspiciously at the pattern with which it has been compared makes the point I ll bet a pound that ain t an English one An easy wager when we run so much into foreign No it belongs to that French gentleman As he nods towards a point of darkness behind mister Wegg the latter with a slight start looks round for that French gentleman whom he at length descries to be represented in a very workmanlike manner by his ribs only standing on a shelf in another corner like a piece of armour or a pair of stays Oh says mister Wegg with a sort of sense of being introduced I dare say you were all right enough in your own country but I hope no objections will be taken to my saying that the Frenchman was never yet born as I should wish to match At this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward and a boy follows it who says after having let it slam Come for the stuffed canary It s three and ninepence returns Venus have you got the money The boy produces four shillings mister Venus always in exceedingly low spirits and making whimpering sounds peers about for the stuffed canary On his taking the candle to assist his search mister Wegg observes that he has a convenient little shelf near his knees exclusively appropriated to skeleton hands which have very much the appearance of wanting to lay hold of him From these mister Venus rescues the canary in a glass case and shows it to the boy There he whimpers There s animation On a twig making up his mind to hop Take care of him he s a lovely specimen And three is four The boy gathers up his change and has pulled the door open by a leather strap nailed to it for the purpose when Venus cries out Stop him Come back you young villain You ve got a tooth among them halfpence How was I to know I d got it You giv it me I don t want none of your teeth I ve got enough of my own So the boy pipes as he selects it from his change and throws it on the counter Don t sauce ME in the wicious pride of your youth mister Venus retorts pathetically Don t hit ME because you see I m down I m low enough without that It dropped into the till I suppose They drop into everything There was two in the coffee pot at breakfast time Molars Very well then argues the boy what do you call names for To which mister Venus only replies shaking his shock of dusty hair and winking his weak eyes Don t sauce ME in the wicious pride of your youth don t hit ME because you see I m down You ve no idea how small you d come out if I had the articulating of you This consideration seems to have its effect on the boy for he goes out grumbling Oh dear me dear me sighs mister Venus heavily snuffing the candle the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow You re casting your eye round the shop mister Wegg Let me show you a light My working bench My young man s bench A Wice Tools Bones warious Skulls warious Preserved Indian baby African ditto Bottled preparations warious Everything within reach of your hand in good preservation The mouldy ones a top What s in those hampers over them again I don t quite remember Say human warious Cats Articulated English baby Dogs Ducks Glass eyes warious Mummied bird Dried cuticle warious Oh dear me That s the general panoramic view Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named and then retire again mister Venus despondently repeats Oh dear me dear me resumes his seat and with drooping despondency upon him falls to pouring himself out more tea Where am I asks mister Wegg You re somewhere in the back shop across the yard sir and speaking quite candidly I wish I d never bought you of the Hospital Porter Now look here what did you give for me Well replies Venus blowing his tea his head and face peering out of the darkness over the smoke of it as if he were modernizing the old original rise in his family you were one of a warious lot and I don t know Silas puts his point in the improved form of What will you take for me Well replies Venus still blowing his tea I m not prepared at a moment s notice to tell you mister Wegg Come According to your own account I m not worth much Wegg reasons persuasively Not for miscellaneous working in I grant you mister Wegg but you might turn out valuable yet as a here mister Venus takes a gulp of tea so hot that it makes him choke and sets his weak eyes watering as a Monstrosity if you ll excuse me Repressing an indignant look indicative of anything but a disposition to excuse him Silas pursues his point I think you know me mister Venus and I think you know I never bargain mister Venus takes gulps of hot tea shutting his eyes at every gulp and opening them again in a spasmodic manner but does not commit himself to assent I have a prospect of getting on in life and elevating myself by my own independent exertions says Wegg feelingly and I shouldn t like I tell you openly I should NOT like under such circumstances to be what I may call dispersed a part of me here and a part of me there but should wish to collect myself like a genteel person It s a prospect at present is it mister Wegg Then you haven t got the money for a deal about you Then I ll tell you what I ll do with you I ll hold you over I am a man of my word and you needn t be afraid of my disposing of you I ll hold you over That s a promise Oh dear me dear me Fain to accept his promise and wishing to propitiate him mister Wegg looks on as he sighs and pours himself out more tea and then says trying to get a sympathetic tone into his voice You seem very low mister Venus Is business bad Never was so good Is your hand out at all Never was so well in mister Wegg I m not only first in the trade but I m THE trade You may go and buy a skeleton at the West End if you like and pay the West End price but it ll be my putting together I ve as much to do as I can possibly do with the assistance of my young man and I take a pride and a pleasure in it mister Venus thus delivers himself his right hand extended his smoking saucer in his left hand protesting as though he were going to burst into a flood of tears That ain t a state of things to make you low mister Venus mister Wegg I know it ain t mister Wegg not to name myself as a workman without an equal I ve gone on improving myself in my knowledge of Anatomy till both by sight and by name I m perfect mister Wegg if you was brought here loose in a bag to be articulated I d name your smallest bones blindfold equally with your largest as fast as I could pick em out and I d sort em all and sort your wertebrae in a manner that would equally surprise and charm you Well remarks Silas though not quite so readily as last time THAT ain t a state of things to be low about Not for YOU to be low about leastways mister Wegg I know it ain t mister Wegg I know it ain t But it s the heart that lowers me it is the heart Be so good as take and read that card out loud Silas receives one from his hand which Venus takes from a wonderful litter in a drawer and putting on his spectacles reads mister Venus Yes Go on Preserver of Animals and Birds Yes Go on Articulator of human bones That s it with a groan That s it mister Wegg I m thirty two and a bachelor mister Wegg I love her mister Wegg she is worthy of being loved by a Potentate Here Silas is rather alarmed by mister Venus s springing to his feet in the hurry of his spirits and haggardly confronting him with his hand on his coat collar but mister Venus begging pardon sits down again saying with the calmness of despair She objects to the business Does she know the profits of it She knows the profits of it but she don t appreciate the art of it and she objects to it I do not wish she writes in her own handwriting to regard myself nor yet to be regarded in that boney light mister Venus pours himself out more tea with a look and in an attitude of the deepest desolation And so a man climbs to the top of the tree mister Wegg only to see that there s no look out when he s up there I sit here of a night surrounded by the lovely trophies of my art and what have they done for me Ruined me Brought me to the pass of being informed that she does not wish to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that boney light Having repeated the fatal expressions mister Venus drinks more tea by gulps and offers an explanation of his doing so It lowers me When I m equally lowered all over lethargy sets in By sticking to it till one or two in the morning I get oblivion Don t let me detain you mister Wegg I m not company for any one It is not on that account says Silas rising but because I ve got an appointment It s time I was at Harmon s Eh said mister Venus Harmon s up Battle Bridge way mister Wegg admits that he is bound for that port You ought to be in a good thing if you ve worked yourself in there There s lots of money going there To think says Silas that you should catch it up so quick and know about it Wonderful Not at all mister Wegg The old gentleman wanted to know the nature and worth of everything that was found in the dust and many s the bone and feather and what not that he s brought to me Really now Yes Oh dear me dear me And he s buried quite in this neighbourhood you know Over yonder mister Wegg does not know but he makes as if he did by responsively nodding his head He also follows with his eyes the toss of Venus s head as if to seek a direction to over yonder I took an interest in that discovery in the river says Venus She hadn t written her cutting refusal at that time I ve got up there never mind though He had raised the candle at arm s length towards one of the dark shelves and mister Wegg had turned to look when he broke off The old gentleman was well known all round here There used to be stories about his having hidden all kinds of property in those dust mounds I suppose there was nothing in em Probably you know mister Wegg Nothing in em says Wegg who has never heard a word of this before Don t let me detain you Good night The unfortunate mister Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of his own head and drooping down in his chair proceeds to pour himself out more tea mister Wegg looking back over his shoulder as he pulls the door open by the strap notices that the movement so shakes the crazy shop and so shakes a momentary flare out of the candle as that the babies Hindoo African and British the human warious the French gentleman the green glass eyed cats the dogs the ducks and all the rest of the collection show for an instant as if paralytically animated while even poor little Cock Robin at mister Venus s elbow turns over on his innocent side Next moment mister Wegg is stumping under the gaslights and through the mud Chapter eight mister BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION Whosoever had gone out of Fleet Street into the Temple at the date of this history and had wandered disconsolate about the Temple until he stumbled on a dismal churchyard and had looked up at the dismal windows commanding that churchyard until at the most dismal window of them all he saw a dismal boy would in him have beheld at one grand comprehensive swoop of the eye the managing clerk junior clerk common law clerk conveyancing clerk chancery clerk every refinement and department of clerk of mister Mortimer Lightwood erewhile called in the newspapers eminent solicitor mister Boffin having been several times in communication with this clerkly essence both on its own ground and at the Bower had no difficulty in identifying it when he saw it up in its dusty eyrie To the second floor on which the window was situated he ascended much pre occupied in mind by the uncertainties besetting the Roman Empire and much regretting the death of the amiable Pertinax who only last night had left the Imperial affairs in a state of great confusion by falling a victim to the fury of the praetorian guards Morning morning morning said mister Boffin with a wave of his hand as the office door was opened by the dismal boy whose appropriate name was Blight Governor in mister Lightwood gave you an appointment sir I think I don t want him to give it you know returned mister Boffin I ll pay my way my boy No doubt sir Would you walk in mister Lightwood ain t in at the present moment but I expect him back very shortly Would you take a seat in mister Lightwood s room sir while I look over our Appointment Book Young Blight made a great show of fetching from his desk a long thin manuscript volume with a brown paper cover and running his finger down the day s appointments murmuring mister Aggs mister Baggs mister Caggs mister Daggs mister Faggs mister Gaggs mister Boffin Yes sir quite right You are a little before your time sir mister Lightwood will be in directly I m not in a hurry said mister Boffin Thank you sir I ll take the opportunity if you please of entering your name in our Callers Book for the day Young Blight made another great show of changing the volume taking up a pen sucking it dipping it and running over previous entries before he wrote As mister Alley mister Balley mister Calley mister Dalley mister Falley mister Galley mister Halley mister Lalley mister Malley And mister Boffin Strict system here eh my lad said mister Boffin as he was booked Yes sir returned the boy I couldn t get on without it By which he probably meant that his mind would have been shattered to pieces without this fiction of an occupation Wearing in his solitary confinement no fetters that he could polish and being provided with no drinking cup that he could carve he had fallen on the device of ringing alphabetical changes into the two volumes in question or of entering vast numbers of persons out of the Directory as transacting business with mister Lightwood It was the more necessary for his spirits because being of a sensitive temperament he was apt to consider it personally disgraceful to himself that his master had no clients How long have you been in the law now asked mister Boffin with a pounce in his usual inquisitive way I ve been in the law now sir about three years Must have been as good as born in it said mister Boffin with admiration Do you like it I don t mind it much returned Young Blight heaving a sigh as if its bitterness were past What wages do you get Half what I could wish replied young Blight What s the whole that you could wish Fifteen shillings a week said the boy About how long might it take you now at a average rate of going to be a Judge asked mister Boffin after surveying his small stature in silence The boy answered that he had not yet quite worked out that little calculation I suppose there s nothing to prevent your going in for it said mister Boffin The boy virtually replied that as he had the honour to be a Briton who never never never there was nothing to prevent his going in for it Yet he seemed inclined to suspect that there might be something to prevent his coming out with it Would a couple of pound help you up at all asked mister Boffin On this head young Blight had no doubt whatever so mister Boffin made him a present of that sum of money and thanked him for his attention to his mister Boffin s affairs which he added were now he believed as good as settled Then mister Boffin with his stick at his ear like a Familiar Spirit explaining the office to him sat staring at a little bookcase of Law Practice and Law Reports and at a window and at an empty blue bag and at a stick of sealing wax and a pen and a box of wafers and an apple and a writing pad all very dusty and at a number of inky smears and blots and at an imperfectly disguised gun case pretending to be something legal and at an iron box labelled HARMON ESTATE until mister Lightwood appeared mister Lightwood explained that he came from the proctor s with whom he had been engaged in transacting mister Boffin s affairs And they seem to have taken a deal out of you said mister Boffin with commiseration mister Lightwood without explaining that his weariness was chronic proceeded with his exposition that all forms of law having been at length complied with will of Harmon deceased having been proved death of Harmon next inheriting having been proved c and so forth Court of Chancery having been moved c and so forth he mister Lightwood had now the gratification honour and happiness again c and so forth of congratulating mister Boffin on coming into possession as residuary legatee of upwards of one hundred thousand pounds standing in the books of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England again c and so forth And what is particularly eligible in the property mister Boffin is that it involves no trouble There are no estates to manage no rents to return so much per cent upon in bad times which is an extremely dear way of getting your name into the newspapers no voters to become parboiled in hot water with no agents to take the cream off the milk before it comes to table You could put the whole in a cash box to morrow morning and take it with you to say to the Rocky Mountains Inasmuch as every man concluded mister Lightwood with an indolent smile appears to be under a fatal spell which obliges him sooner or later to mention the Rocky Mountains in a tone of extreme familiarity to some other man I hope you ll excuse my pressing you into the service of that gigantic range of geographical bores Without following this last remark very closely mister Boffin cast his perplexed gaze first at the ceiling and then at the carpet Well he remarked I don t know what to say about it I am sure I was a most as well as I was It s a great lot to take care of My dear mister Boffin then DON T take care of it Eh said that gentleman Speaking now returned Mortimer with the irresponsible imbecility of a private individual and not with the profundity of a professional adviser I should say that if the circumstance of its being too much weighs upon your mind you have the haven of consolation open to you that you can easily make it less And if you should be apprehensive of the trouble of doing so there is the further haven of consolation that any number of people will take the trouble off your hands Well I don t quite see it retorted mister Boffin still perplexed That s not satisfactory you know what you re a saying Is Anything satisfactory mister Boffin asked Mortimer raising his eyebrows I used to find it so answered mister Boffin with a wistful look While I was foreman at the Bower afore it WAS the Bower I considered the business very satisfactory The old man was a awful Tartar saying it I m sure without disrespect to his memory but the business was a pleasant one to look after from before daylight to past dark It s a most a pity said mister Boffin rubbing his ear that he ever went and made so much money It would have been better for him if he hadn t so given himself up to it You may depend upon it making the discovery all of a sudden that HE found it a great lot to take care of mister Lightwood coughed not convinced And speaking of satisfactory pursued mister Boffin why Lord save us when we come to take it to pieces bit by bit where s the satisfactoriness of the money as yet When the old man does right the poor boy after all the poor boy gets no good of it He gets made away with at the moment when he s lifting as one may say the cup and sarser to his lips mister Lightwood I will now name to you that on behalf of the poor dear boy me and missus Boffin have stood out against the old man times out of number till he has called us every name he could lay his tongue to I have seen him after missus Boffin has given him her mind respecting the claims of the nat ral affections catch off missus Boffin s bonnet she wore in general a black straw perched as a matter of convenience on the top of her head and send it spinning across the yard I have indeed And once when he did this in a manner that amounted to personal I should have given him a rattler for himself if missus Boffin hadn t thrown herself betwixt us and received flush on the temple Which dropped her mister Lightwood Dropped her mister Lightwood murmured Equal honour missus Boffin s head and heart You understand I name this pursued mister Boffin to show you now the affairs are wound up that me and missus Boffin have ever stood as we were in Christian honour bound the children s friend Me and missus Boffin stood the poor girl s friend me and missus Boffin stood the poor boy s friend me and missus Boffin up and faced the old man when we momently expected to be turned out for our pains As to missus Boffin said mister Boffin lowering his voice she mightn t wish it mentioned now she s Fashionable but she went so far as to tell him in my presence he was a flinty hearted rascal mister Lightwood murmured Vigorous Saxon spirit missus Boffin s ancestors bowmen Agincourt and Cressy The last time me and missus Boffin saw the poor boy said mister Boffin warming as fat usually does with a tendency to melt he was a child of seven year old For when he came back to make intercession for his sister me and missus Boffin were away overlooking a country contract which was to be sifted before carted and he was come and gone in a single hour I say he was a child of seven year old He was going away all alone and forlorn to that foreign school and he come into our place situate up the yard of the present Bower to have a warm at our fire There was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him There was his little scanty box outside in the shivering wind which I was going to carry for him down to the steamboat as the old man wouldn t hear of allowing a sixpence coach money missus Boffin then quite a young woman and pictur of a full blown rose stands him by her kneels down at the fire warms her two open hands and falls to rubbing his cheeks but seeing the tears come into the child s eyes the tears come fast into her own and she holds him round the neck like as if she was protecting him and cries to me I d give the wide wide world I would to run away with him I don t say but what it cut me and but what it at the same time heightened my feelings of admiration for missus Boffin The poor child clings to her for awhile as she clings to him and then when the old man calls he says I must go God bless you and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom and looks up at both of us as if it was in pain in agony Such a look I went aboard with him I gave him first what little treat I thought he d like and I left him when he had fallen asleep in his berth and I came back to missus Boffin But tell her what I would of how I had left him it all went for nothing for according to her thoughts he never changed that look that he had looked up at us two But it did one piece of good missus Boffin and me had no child of our own and had sometimes wished that how we had one But not now We might both of us die says missus Boffin and other eyes might see that lonely look in our child So of a night when it was very cold or when the wind roared or the rain dripped heavy she would wake sobbing and call out in a fluster Don t you see the poor child s face O shelter the poor child till in course of years it gently wore out as many things do My dear mister Boffin everything wears to rags said Mortimer with a light laugh I won t go so far as to say everything returned mister Boffin on whom his manner seemed to grate because there s some things that I never found among the dust Well sir So missus Boffin and me grow older and older in the old man s service living and working pretty hard in it till the old man is discovered dead in his bed Then missus Boffin and me seal up his box always standing on the table at the side of his bed and having frequently heerd tell of the Temple as a spot where lawyer s dust is contracted for I come down here in search of a lawyer to advise and I see your young man up at this present elevation chopping at the flies on the window sill with his penknife and I give him a Hoy not then having the pleasure of your acquaintance and by that means come to gain the honour Then you and the gentleman in the uncomfortable neck cloth under the little archway in Saint Paul s Churchyard Doctors Commons observed Lightwood I understood it was another name said mister Boffin pausing but you know best Then you and Doctor Scommons you go to work and you do the thing that s proper and you and Doctor S take steps for finding out the poor boy and at last you do find out the poor boy and me and missus Boffin often exchange the observation We shall see him again under happy circumstances But it was never to be and the want of satisfactoriness is that after all the money never gets to him But it gets remarked Lightwood with a languid inclination of the head into excellent hands It gets into the hands of me and missus Boffin only this very day and hour and that s what I am working round to having waited for this day and hour a purpose mister Lightwood here has been a wicked cruel murder By that murder me and missus Boffin mysteriously profit For the apprehension and conviction of the murderer we offer a reward of one tithe of the property a reward of Ten Thousand Pound mister Boffin it s too much mister Lightwood me and missus Boffin have fixed the sum together and we stand to it But let me represent to you returned Lightwood speaking now with professional profundity and not with individual imbecility that the offer of such an immense reward is a temptation to forced suspicion forced construction of circumstances strained accusation a whole tool box of edged tools Well said mister Boffin a little staggered that s the sum we put o one side for the purpose Whether it shall be openly declared in the new notices that must now be put about in our names In your name mister Boffin in your name Very well in my name which is the same as missus Boffin s and means both of us is to be considered in drawing em up But this is the first instruction that I as the owner of the property give to my lawyer on coming into it Your lawyer mister Boffin returned Lightwood making a very short note of it with a very rusty pen has the gratification of taking the instruction There is another There is just one other and no more Make me as compact a little will as can be reconciled with tightness leaving the whole of the property to my beloved wife Henerietty Boffin sole executrix Make it as short as you can using those words but make it tight At some loss to fathom mister Boffin s notions of a tight will Lightwood felt his way I beg your pardon but professional profundity must be exact When you say tight I mean tight mister Boffin explained Exactly so And nothing can be more laudable But is the tightness to bind missus Boffin to any and what conditions Bind missus Boffin interposed her husband No What are you thinking of What I want is to make it all hers so tight as that her hold of it can t be loosed Hers freely to do what she likes with Hers absolutely Absolutely repeated mister Boffin with a short sturdy laugh Hah I should think so It would be handsome in me to begin to bind missus Boffin at this time of day So that instruction too was taken by mister Lightwood and mister Lightwood having taken it was in the act of showing mister Boffin out when mister Eugene Wrayburn almost jostled him in the door way Consequently mister Lightwood said in his cool manner Let me make you two known to one another and further signified that mister Wrayburn was counsel learned in the law and that partly in the way of business and partly in the way of pleasure he had imparted to mister Wrayburn some of the interesting facts of mister Boffin s biography Delighted said Eugene though he didn t look so to know mister Boffin Thankee sir thankee returned that gentleman And how do YOU like the law A not particularly returned Eugene Too dry for you eh Well I suppose it wants some years of sticking to before you master it But there s nothing like work Look at the bees I beg your pardon returned Eugene with a reluctant smile but will you excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to the bees Do you said mister Boffin I object on principle said Eugene as a biped As a what asked mister Boffin As a two footed creature I object on principle as a two footed creature to being constantly referred to insects and four footed creatures I object to being required to model my proceedings according to the proceedings of the bee or the dog or the spider or the camel I fully admit that the camel for instance is an excessively temperate person but he has several stomachs to entertain himself with and I have only one Besides I am not fitted up with a convenient cool cellar to keep my drink in But I said you know urged mister Boffin rather at a loss for an answer the bee Exactly And may I represent to you that it s injudicious to say the bee For the whole case is assumed Conceding for a moment that there is any analogy between a bee and a man in a shirt and pantaloons which I deny and that it is settled that the man is to learn from the bee which I also deny the question still remains what is he to learn To imitate Or to avoid When your friends the bees worry themselves to that highly fluttered extent about their sovereign and become perfectly distracted touching the slightest monarchical movement are we men to learn the greatness of Tuft hunting or the littleness of the Court Circular I am not clear mister Boffin but that the hive may be satirical At all events they work said mister Boffin Ye es returned Eugene disparagingly they work but don t you think they overdo it They work so much more than they need they make so much more than they can eat they are so incessantly boring and buzzing at their one idea till Death comes upon them that don t you think they overdo it And are human labourers to have no holidays because of the bees And am I never to have change of air because the bees don t mister Boffin I think honey excellent at breakfast but regarded in the light of my conventional schoolmaster and moralist I protest against the tyrannical humbug of your friend the bee With the highest respect for you Thankee said mister Boffin Morning morning But the worthy mister Boffin jogged away with a comfortless impression he could have dispensed with that there was a deal of unsatisfactoriness in the world besides what he had recalled as appertaining to the Harmon property And he was still jogging along Fleet Street in this condition of mind when he became aware that he was closely tracked and observed by a man of genteel appearance Now then said mister Boffin stopping short with his meditations brought to an abrupt check what s the next article I beg your pardon mister Boffin My name too eh How did you come by it I don t know you No sir you don t know me mister Boffin looked full at the man and the man looked full at him No said mister Boffin after a glance at the pavement as if it were made of faces and he were trying to match the man s I DON T know you I am nobody said the stranger and not likely to be known but mister Boffin s wealth Oh that s got about already has it muttered mister Boffin And his romantic manner of acquiring it make him conspicuous You were pointed out to me the other day Well said mister Boffin I should say I was a disappintment to you when I WAS pinted out if your politeness would allow you to confess it for I am well aware I am not much to look at What might you want with me Not in the law are you No sir No information to give for a reward No sir There may have been a momentary mantling in the face of the man as he made the last answer but it passed directly If I don t mistake you have followed me from my lawyer s and tried to fix my attention Say out Have you Or haven t you demanded mister Boffin rather angry Yes Why have you If you will allow me to walk beside you mister Boffin I will tell you Would you object to turn aside into this place I think it is called Clifford s Inn where we can hear one another better than in the roaring street Now thought mister Boffin if he proposes a game at skittles or meets a country gentleman just come into property or produces any article of jewellery he has found I ll knock him down With this discreet reflection and carrying his stick in his arms much as Punch carries his mister Boffin turned into Clifford s Inn aforesaid mister Boffin I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning when I saw you going along before me I took the liberty of following you trying to make up my mind to speak to you till you went into your lawyer s Then I waited outside till you came out Don t quite sound like skittles nor yet country gentleman nor yet jewellery thought mister Boffin but there s no knowing I am afraid my object is a bold one I am afraid it has little of the usual practical world about it but I venture it If you ask me or if you ask yourself which is more likely what emboldens me I answer I have been strongly assured that you are a man of rectitude and plain dealing with the soundest of sound hearts and that you are blessed in a wife distinguished by the same qualities Your information is true of missus Boffin anyhow was mister Boffin s answer as he surveyed his new friend again There was something repressed in the strange man s manner and he walked with his eyes on the ground though conscious for all that of mister Boffin s observation and he spoke in a subdued voice But his words came easily and his voice was agreeable in tone albeit constrained When I add I can discern for myself what the general tongue says of you that you are quite unspoiled by Fortune and not uplifted I trust you will not as a man of an open nature suspect that I mean to flatter you but will believe that all I mean is to excuse myself these being my only excuses for my present intrusion How much thought mister Boffin It must be coming to money How much You will probably change your manner of living mister Boffin in your changed circumstances You will probably keep a larger house have many matters to arrange and be beset by numbers of correspondents If you would try me as your Secretary As WHAT cried mister Boffin with his eyes wide open Your Secretary Well said mister Boffin under his breath that s a queer thing Or pursued the stranger wondering at mister Boffin s wonder if you would try me as your man of business under any name I know you would find me faithful and grateful and I hope you would find me useful You may naturally think that my immediate object is money Not so for I would willingly serve you a year two years any term you might appoint before that should begin to be a consideration between us Where do you come from asked mister Boffin I come returned the other meeting his eye from many countries Boffin s acquaintances with the names and situations of foreign lands being limited in extent and somewhat confused in quality he shaped his next question on an elastic model From any particular place I have been in many places What have you been asked mister Boffin Here again he made no great advance for the reply was I have been a student and a traveller But if it ain t a liberty to plump it out said mister Boffin what do you do for your living I have mentioned returned the other with another look at him and a smile what I aspire to do I have been superseded as to some slight intentions I had and I may say that I have now to begin life Not very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant and feeling the more embarrassed because his manner and appearance claimed a delicacy in which the worthy mister Boffin feared he himself might be deficient that gentleman glanced into the mouldy little plantation or cat preserve of Clifford s Inn as it was that day in search of a suggestion Sparrows were there cats were there dry rot and wet rot were there but it was not otherwise a suggestive spot All this time said the stranger producing a little pocket book and taking out a card I have not mentioned my name My name is Rokesmith I lodge at one mister Wilfer s at Holloway mister Boffin stared again Father of Miss Bella Wilfer said he My landlord has a daughter named Bella Yes no doubt Now this name had been more or less in mister Boffin s thoughts all the morning and for days before therefore he said That s singular too unconsciously staring again past all bounds of good manners with the card in his hand Though by the bye I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out No I have never been in the streets with one of them Heard me talked of among em though No I occupy my own rooms and have held scarcely any communication with them Odder and odder said mister Boffin Well sir to tell you the truth I don t know what to say to you Say nothing returned mister Rokesmith allow me to call on you in a few days I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would accept me on trust at first sight and take me out of the very street Let me come to you for your further opinion at your leisure That s fair and I don t object said mister Boffin but it must be on condition that it s fully understood that I no more know that I shall ever be in want of any gentleman as Secretary it WAS Secretary you said wasn t it Yes Again mister Boffin s eyes opened wide and he stared at the applicant from head to foot repeating Queer You re sure it was Secretary Are you I am sure I said so As Secretary repeated mister Boffin meditating upon the word I no more know that I may ever want a Secretary or what not than I do that I shall ever be in want of the man in the moon Me and missus Boffin have not even settled that we shall make any change in our way of life missus Boffin s inclinations certainly do tend towards Fashion but being already set up in a fashionable way at the Bower she may not make further alterations However sir as you don t press yourself I wish to meet you so far as saying by all means call at the Bower if you like Call in the course of a week or two At the same time I consider that I ought to name in addition to what I have already named that I have in my employment a literary man WITH a wooden leg as I have no thoughts of parting from I regret to hear I am in some sort anticipated mister Rokesmith answered evidently having heard it with surprise but perhaps other duties might arise You see returned mister Boffin with a confidential sense of dignity as to my literary man s duties they re clear Professionally he declines and he falls and as a friend he drops into poetry Without observing that these duties seemed by no means clear to mister Rokesmith s astonished comprehension mister Boffin went on And now sir I ll wish you good day You can call at the Bower any time in a week or two It s not above a mile or so from you and your landlord can direct you to it But as he may not know it by its new name of Boffin s Bower say when you inquire of him it s Harmon s will you Harmoon s repeated mister Rokesmith seeming to have caught the sound imperfectly Harmarn s How do you spell it Why as to the spelling of it returned mister Boffin with great presence of mind that s YOUR look out Harmon s is all you ve got to say to HIM Morning morning morning And so departed without looking back Chapter nine mister AND missus BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION Betaking himself straight homeward mister Boffin without further let or hindrance arrived at the Bower and gave missus Boffin in a walking dress of black velvet and feathers like a mourning coach horse an account of all he had said and done since breakfast This brings us round my dear he then pursued to the question we left unfinished namely whether there s to be any new go in for Fashion Now I ll tell you what I want Noddy said missus Boffin smoothing her dress with an air of immense enjoyment I want Society Fashionable Society my dear Yes cried missus Boffin laughing with the glee of a child Yes It s no good my being kept here like Wax Work is it now People have to pay to see Wax Work my dear returned her husband whereas though you d be cheap at the same money the neighbours is welcome to see YOU for nothing But it don t answer said the cheerful missus Boffin When we worked like the neighbours we suited one another Now we have left work off we have left off suiting one another What do you think of beginning work again mister Boffin hinted Out of the question We have come into a great fortune and we must do what s right by our fortune we must act up to it mister Boffin who had a deep respect for his wife s intuitive wisdom replied though rather pensively I suppose we must It s never been acted up to yet and consequently no good has come of it said missus Boffin True to the present time mister Boffin assented with his former pensiveness as he took his seat upon his settle I hope good may be coming of it in the future time Towards which what s your views old lady missus Boffin a smiling creature broad of figure and simple of nature with her hands folded in her lap and with buxom creases in her throat proceeded to expound her views I say a good house in a good neighbourhood good things about us good living and good society I say live like our means without extravagance and be happy Yes I say be happy too assented the still pensive mister Boffin Lor a mussy exclaimed missus Boffin laughing and clapping her hands and gaily rocking herself to and fro when I think of me in a light yellow chariot and pair with silver boxes to the wheels Oh you was thinking of that was you my dear Yes cried the delighted creature And with a footman up behind with a bar across to keep his legs from being poled And with a coachman up in front sinking down into a seat big enough for three of him all covered with upholstery in green and white And with two bay horses tossing their heads and stepping higher than they trot long ways And with you and me leaning back inside as grand as ninepence Oh h h h My Ha ha ha ha ha missus Boffin clapped her hands again rocked herself again beat her feet upon the floor and wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes And what my old lady inquired mister Boffin when he also had sympathetically laughed what s your views on the subject of the Bower Shut it up Don t part with it but put somebody in it to keep it Any other views Noddy said missus Boffin coming from her fashionable sofa to his side on the plain settle and hooking her comfortable arm through his Next I think and I really have been thinking early and late of the disappointed girl her that was so cruelly disappointed you know both of her husband and his riches Don t you think we might do something for her Have her to live with us Or something of that sort Ne ver once thought of the way of doing it cried mister Boffin smiting the table in his admiration What a thinking steam ingein this old lady is And she don t know how she does it Neither does the ingein missus Boffin pulled his nearest ear in acknowledgment of this piece of philosophy and then said gradually toning down to a motherly strain Last and not least I have taken a fancy You remember dear little John Harmon before he went to school Over yonder across the yard at our fire Now that he is past all benefit of the money and it s come to us I should like to find some orphan child and take the boy and adopt him and give him John s name and provide for him Somehow it would make me easier I fancy Say it s only a whim But I don t say so interposed her husband No but deary if you did I should be a Beast if I did her husband interposed again That s as much as to say you agree Good and kind of you and like you deary And don t you begin to find it pleasant now said missus Boffin once more radiant in her comely way from head to foot and once more smoothing her dress with immense enjoyment don t you begin to find it pleasant already to think that a child will be made brighter and better and happier because of that poor sad child that day And isn t it pleasant to know that the good will be done with the poor sad child s own money Yes and it s pleasant to know that you are missus Boffin said her husband and it s been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a year It was ruin to missus Boffin s aspirations but having so spoken they sat side by side a hopelessly Unfashionable pair These two ignorant and unpolished people had guided themselves so far on in their journey of life by a religious sense of duty and desire to do right Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both ten thousand vanities additional possibly in the breast of the woman But the hard wrathful and sordid nature that had wrung as much work out of them as could be got in their best days for as little money as could be paid to hurry on their worst had never been so warped but that it knew their moral straightness and respected it In its own despite in a constant conflict with itself and them it had done so And this is the eternal law For Evil often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it but Good never Through his most inveterate purposes the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had known these two faithful servants to be honest and true While he raged at them and reviled them for opposing him with the speech of the honest and true it had scratched his stony heart and he had perceived the powerlessness of all his wealth to buy them if he had addressed himself to the attempt So even while he was their griping taskmaster and never gave them a good word he had written their names down in his will So even while it was his daily declaration that he mistrusted all mankind and sorely indeed he did mistrust all who bore any resemblance to himself he was as certain that these two people surviving him would be trustworthy in all things from the greatest to the least as he was that he must surely die mister and missus Boffin sitting side by side with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan missus Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers requesting orphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain day but mister Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring thoroughfares by orphan swarms this course was negatived missus Boffin next suggested application to their clergyman for a likely orphan mister Boffin thinking better of this scheme they resolved to call upon the reverend gentleman at once and to take the same opportunity of making acquaintance with Miss Bella Wilfer In order that these visits might be visits of state missus Boffin s equipage was ordered out This consisted of a long hammer headed old horse formerly used in the business attached to a four wheeled chaise of the same period which had long been exclusively used by the Harmony Jail poultry as the favourite laying place of several discreet hens An unwonted application of corn to the horse and of paint and varnish to the carriage when both fell in as a part of the Boffin legacy had made what mister Boffin considered a neat turn out of the whole and a driver being added in the person of a long hammer headed young man who was a very good match for the horse left nothing to be desired He too had been formerly used in the business but was now entombed by an honest jobbing tailor of the district in a perfect Sepulchre of coat and gaiters sealed with ponderous buttons Behind this domestic mister and missus Boffin took their seats in the back compartment of the vehicle which was sufficiently commodious but had an undignified and alarming tendency in getting over a rough crossing to hiccup itself away from the front compartment On their being descried emerging from the gates of the Bower the neighbourhood turned out at door and window to salute the Boffins Among those who were ever and again left behind staring after the equipage were many youthful spirits who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as Nod dy Bof fin Bof fin s mon ey Down with the dust Bof fin and other similar compliments These the hammer headed young man took in such ill part that he often impaired the majesty of the progress by pulling up short and making as though he would alight to exterminate the offenders a purpose from which he only allowed himself to be dissuaded after long and lively arguments with his employers At length the Bower district was left behind and the peaceful dwelling of the Reverend Frank Milvey was gained The Reverend Frank Milvey s abode was a very modest abode because his income was a very modest income He was officially accessible to every blundering old woman who had incoherence to bestow upon him and readily received the Boffins He was quite a young man expensively educated and wretchedly paid with quite a young wife and half a dozen quite young children He was under the necessity of teaching and translating from the classics to eke out his scanty means yet was generally expected to have more time to spare than the idlest person in the parish and more money than the richest He accepted the needless inequalities and inconsistencies of his life with a kind of conventional submission that was almost slavish and any daring layman who would have adjusted such burdens as his more decently and graciously would have had small help from him With a ready patient face and manner and yet with a latent smile that showed a quick enough observation of missus Boffin s dress mister Milvey in his little book room charged with sounds and cries as though the six children above were coming down through the ceiling and the roasting leg of mutton below were coming up through the floor listened to missus Boffin s statement of her want of an orphan I think said mister Milvey that you have never had a child of your own mister and missus Boffin Never But like the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales I suppose you have wished for one In a general way yes mister Milvey smiled again as he remarked to himself Those kings and queens were always wishing for children It occurring to him perhaps that if they had been Curates their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction I think he pursued we had better take missus Milvey into our Council She is indispensable to me If you please I ll call her So mister Milvey called Margaretta my dear and missus Milvey came down A pretty bright little woman something worn by anxiety who had repressed many pretty tastes and bright fancies and substituted in their stead schools soup flannel coals and all the week day cares and Sunday coughs of a large population young and old As gallantly had mister Milvey repressed much in himself that naturally belonged to his old studies and old fellow students and taken up among the poor and their children with the hard crumbs of life mister and missus Boffin my dear whose good fortune you have heard of missus Milvey with the most unaffected grace in the world congratulated them and was glad to see them Yet her engaging face being an open as well as a perceptive one was not without her husband s latent smile missus Boffin wishes to adopt a little boy my dear missus Milvey looking rather alarmed her husband added An orphan my dear Oh said missus Milvey reassured for her own little boys And I was thinking Margaretta that perhaps old missus Goody s grandchild might answer the purpose Oh my DEAR Frank I DON T think that would do No Oh NO The smiling missus Boffin feeling it incumbent on her to take part in the conversation and being charmed with the emphatic little wife and her ready interest here offered her acknowledgments and inquired what there was against him I DON T think said missus Milvey glancing at the Reverend Frank and I believe my husband will agree with me when he considers it again that you could possibly keep that orphan clean from snuff Because his grandmother takes so MANY ounces and drops it over him But he would not be living with his grandmother then Margaretta said mister Milvey No Frank but it would be impossible to keep her from missus Boffin s house and the MORE there was to eat and drink there the oftener she would go And she IS an inconvenient woman I HOPE it s not uncharitable to remember that last Christmas Eve she drank eleven cups of tea and grumbled all the time And she is NOT a grateful woman Frank You recollect her addressing a crowd outside this house about her wrongs when one night after we had gone to bed she brought back the petticoat of new flannel that had been given her because it was too short That s true said mister Milvey I don t think that would do Would little Harrison Oh FRANK remonstrated his emphatic wife He has no grandmother my dear No but I DON T think missus Boffin would like an orphan who squints so MUCH That s true again said mister Milvey becoming haggard with perplexity If a little girl would do But my DEAR Frank missus Boffin wants a boy That s true again said mister Milvey Tom Bocker is a nice boy thoughtfully But I DOUBT Frank missus Milvey hinted after a little hesitation if missus Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen who drives a cart and waters the roads mister Milvey referred the point to missus Boffin in a look on that smiling lady s shaking her black velvet bonnet and bows he remarked in lower spirits that s true again I am sure said missus Boffin concerned at giving so much trouble that if I had known you would have taken so much pains sir and you too ma am I don t think I would have come PRAY don t say that urged missus Milvey No don t say that assented mister Milvey because we are so much obliged to you for giving us the preference Which missus Milvey confirmed and really the kind conscientious couple spoke as if they kept some profitable orphan warehouse and were personally patronized But it is a responsible trust added mister Milvey and difficult to discharge At the same time we are naturally very unwilling to lose the chance you so kindly give us and if you could afford us a day or two to look about us you know Margaretta we might carefully examine the workhouse and the Infant School and your District To be SURE said the emphatic little wife We have orphans I know pursued mister Milvey quite with the air as if he might have added in stock and quite as anxiously as if there were great competition in the business and he were afraid of losing an order over at the clay pits but they are employed by relations or friends and I am afraid it would come at last to a transaction in the way of barter And even if you exchanged blankets for the child or books and firing it would be impossible to prevent their being turned into liquor Accordingly it was resolved that mister and missus Milvey should search for an orphan likely to suit and as free as possible from the foregoing objections and should communicate again with missus Boffin Then mister Boffin took the liberty of mentioning to mister Milvey that if mister Milvey would do him the kindness to be perpetually his banker to the extent of a twenty pound note or so to be expended without any reference to him he would be heartily obliged At this both mister Milvey and missus Milvey were quite as much pleased as if they had no wants of their own but only knew what poverty was in the persons of other people and so the interview terminated with satisfaction and good opinion on all sides Now old lady said mister Boffin as they resumed their seats behind the hammer headed horse and man having made a very agreeable visit there we ll try Wilfer s It appeared on their drawing up at the family gate that to try Wilfer s was a thing more easily projected than done on account of the extreme difficulty of getting into that establishment three pulls at the bell producing no external result though each was attended by audible sounds of scampering and rushing within At the fourth tug vindictively administered by the hammer headed young man Miss Lavinia appeared emerging from the house in an accidental manner with a bonnet and parasol as designing to take a contemplative walk The young lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate and expressed her feelings in appropriate action Here s mister and missus Boffin growled the hammer headed young man through the bars of the gate and at the same time shaking it as if he were on view in a Menagerie they ve been here half an hour Who did you say asked Miss Lavinia mister and missus BOFFIN returned the young man rising into a roar Miss Lavinia tripped up the steps to the house door tripped down the steps with the key tripped across the little garden and opened the gate Please to walk in said Miss Lavinia haughtily Our servant is out mister and missus Boffin complying and pausing in the little hall until Miss Lavinia came up to show them where to go next perceived three pairs of listening legs upon the stairs above missus Wilfer s legs Miss Bella s legs mister George Sampson s legs mister and missus Boffin I think said Lavinia in a warning voice Strained attention on the part of missus Wilfer s legs of Miss Bella s legs of mister George Sampson s legs Yes Miss If you ll step this way down these stairs I ll let Ma know Excited flight of missus Wilfer s legs of Miss Bella s legs of mister George Sampson s legs After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting room which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors or cleared for blindman s buff mister and missus Boffin became aware of the entrance of missus Wilfer majestically faint and with a condescending stitch in her side which was her company manner Pardon me said missus Wilfer after the first salutations and as soon as she had adjusted the handkerchief under her chin and waved her gloved hands to what am I indebted for this honour To make short of it ma am returned mister Boffin perhaps you may be acquainted with the names of me and missus Boffin as having come into a certain property I have heard sir returned missus Wilfer with a dignified bend of her head of such being the case And I dare say ma am pursued mister Boffin while missus Boffin added confirmatory nods and smiles you are not very much inclined to take kindly to us Pardon me said missus Wilfer Twere unjust to visit upon mister and missus Boffin a calamity which was doubtless a dispensation These words were rendered the more effective by a serenely heroic expression of suffering That s fairly meant I am sure remarked the honest mister Boffin missus Boffin and me ma am are plain people and we don t want to pretend to anything nor yet to go round and round at anything because there s always a straight way to everything Consequently we make this call to say that we shall be glad to have the honour and pleasure of your daughter s acquaintance and that we shall be rejoiced if your daughter will come to consider our house in the light of her home equally with this In short we want to cheer your daughter and to give her the opportunity of sharing such pleasures as we are a going to take ourselves We want to brisk her up and brisk her about and give her a change That s it said the open hearted missus Boffin Lor Let s be comfortable missus Wilfer bent her head in a distant manner to her lady visitor and with majestic monotony replied to the gentleman Pardon me I have several daughters Which of my daughters am I to understand is thus favoured by the kind intentions of mister Boffin and his lady Don t you see the ever smiling missus Boffin put in Naturally Miss Bella you know Oh h said missus Wilfer with a severely unconvinced look My daughter Bella is accessible and shall speak for herself Then opening the door a little way simultaneously with a sound of scuttling outside it the good lady made the proclamation Send Miss Bella to me which proclamation though grandly formal and one might almost say heraldic to hear was in fact enunciated with her maternal eyes reproachfully glaring on that young lady in the flesh and in so much of it that she was retiring with difficulty into the small closet under the stairs apprehensive of the emergence of mister and missus Boffin The avocations of R W my husband missus Wilfer explained on resuming her seat keep him fully engaged in the City at this time of the day or he would have had the honour of participating in your reception beneath our humble roof Very pleasant premises said mister Boffin cheerfully Pardon me sir returned missus Wilfer correcting him it is the abode of conscious though independent Poverty Finding it rather difficult to pursue the conversation down this road mister and missus Boffin sat staring at mid air and missus Wilfer sat silently giving them to understand that every breath she drew required to be drawn with a self denial rarely paralleled in history until Miss Bella appeared whom missus Wilfer presented and to whom she explained the purpose of the visitors I am much obliged to you I am sure said Miss Bella coldly shaking her curls but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all Bella missus Wilfer admonished her Bella you must conquer this Yes do what your Ma says and conquer it my dear urged missus Boffin because we shall be so glad to have you and because you are much too pretty to keep yourself shut up With that the pleasant creature gave her a kiss and patted her on her dimpled shoulders missus Wilfer sitting stiffly by like a functionary presiding over an interview previous to an execution We are going to move into a nice house said missus Boffin who was woman enough to compromise mister Boffin on that point when he couldn t very well contest it and we are going to set up a nice carriage and we ll go everywhere and see everything And you mustn t seating Bella beside her and patting her hand you mustn t feel a dislike to us to begin with because we couldn t help it you know my dear With the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper Miss Bella was so touched by the simplicity of this address that she frankly returned missus Boffin s kiss Not at all to the satisfaction of that good woman of the world her mother who sought to hold the advantageous ground of obliging the Boffins instead of being obliged My youngest daughter Lavinia said missus Wilfer glad to make a diversion as that young lady reappeared mister George Sampson a friend of the family The friend of the family was in that stage of tender passion which bound him to regard everybody else as the foe of the family He put the round head of his cane in his mouth like a stopper when he sat down As if he felt himself full to the throat with affronting sentiments And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes If you like to bring your sister with you when you come to stay with us said missus Boffin of course we shall be glad The better you please yourself Miss Bella the better you ll please us Oh my consent is of no consequence at all I suppose cried Miss Lavinia Lavvy said her sister in a low voice have the goodness to be seen and not heard No I won t replied the sharp Lavinia I m not a child to be taken notice of by strangers You ARE a child I m not a child and I won t be taken notice of Bring your sister indeed Lavinia said missus Wilfer Hold I will not allow you to utter in my presence the absurd suspicion that any strangers I care not what their names can patronize my child Do you dare to suppose you ridiculous girl that mister and missus Boffin would enter these doors upon a patronizing errand or if they did would remain within them only for one single instant while your mother had the strength yet remaining in her vital frame to request them to depart You little know your mother if you presume to think so It s all very fine Lavinia began to grumble when missus Wilfer repeated Hold I will not allow this Do you not know what is due to guests Do you not comprehend that in presuming to hint that this lady and gentleman could have any idea of patronizing any member of your family I care not which you accuse them of an impertinence little less than insane Never mind me and missus Boffin ma am said mister Boffin smilingly we don t care Pardon me but I do returned missus Wilfer Miss Lavinia laughed a short laugh as she muttered Yes to be sure And I require my audacious child proceeded missus Wilfer with a withering look at her youngest on whom it had not the slightest effect to please to be just to her sister Bella to remember that her sister Bella is much sought after and that when her sister Bella accepts an attention she considers herself to be conferring qui i ite as much honour this with an indignant shiver as she receives But here Miss Bella repudiated and said quietly I can speak for myself you know ma You needn t bring ME in please And it s all very well aiming at others through convenient me said the irrepressible Lavinia spitefully but I should like to ask George Sampson what he says to it mister Sampson proclaimed missus Wilfer seeing that young gentleman take his stopper out and so darkly fixing him with her eyes as that he put it in again mister Sampson as a friend of this family and a frequenter of this house is I am persuaded far too well bred to interpose on such an invitation This exaltation of the young gentleman moved the conscientious missus Boffin to repentance for having done him an injustice in her mind and consequently to saying that she and mister Boffin would at any time be glad to see him an attention which he handsomely acknowledged by replying with his stopper unremoved Much obliged to you but I m always engaged day and night However Bella compensating for all drawbacks by responding to the advances of the Boffins in an engaging way that easy pair were on the whole well satisfied and proposed to the said Bella that as soon as they should be in a condition to receive her in a manner suitable to their desires missus Boffin should return with notice of the fact This arrangement missus Wilfer sanctioned with a stately inclination of her head and wave of her gloves as who should say Your demerits shall be overlooked and you shall be mercifully gratified poor people By the bye ma am said mister Boffin turning back as he was going you have a lodger A gentleman missus Wilfer answered qualifying the low expression undoubtedly occupies our first floor I may call him Our Mutual Friend said mister Boffin What sort of a fellow IS Our Mutual Friend now Do you like him mister Rokesmith is very punctual very quiet a very eligible inmate Because mister Boffin explained you must know that I m not particularly well acquainted with Our Mutual Friend for I have only seen him once You give a good account of him Is he at home mister Rokesmith is at home said missus Wilfer indeed pointing through the window there he stands at the garden gate Waiting for you perhaps Perhaps so replied mister Boffin Saw me come in maybe Bella had closely attended to this short dialogue Accompanying missus Boffin to the gate she as closely watched what followed How are you sir how are you said mister Boffin This is missus Boffin mister Rokesmith that I told you of my dear She gave him good day and he bestirred himself and helped her to her seat and the like with a ready hand Good bye for the present Miss Bella said missus Boffin calling out a hearty parting We shall meet again soon And then I hope I shall have my little John Harmon to show you mister Rokesmith who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of her dress suddenly looked behind him and around him and then looked up at her with a face so pale that missus Boffin cried Gracious And after a moment What s the matter sir How can you show her the Dead returned mister Rokesmith It s only an adopted child One I have told her of One I m going to give the name to You took me by surprise said mister Rokesmith and it sounded like an omen that you should speak of showing the Dead to one so young and blooming Now Bella suspected by this time that mister Rokesmith admired her Whether the knowledge for it was rather that than suspicion caused her to incline to him a little more or a little less than she had done at first whether it rendered her eager to find out more about him because she sought to establish reason for her distrust or because she sought to free him from it was as yet dark to her own heart But at most times he occupied a great amount of her attention and she had set her attention closely on this incident That he knew it as well as she she knew as well as he when they were left together standing on the path by the garden gate Those are worthy people Miss Wilfer Do you know them well asked Bella He smiled reproaching her and she coloured reproaching herself both with the knowledge that she had meant to entrap him into an answer not true when he said I know OF them Truly he told us he had seen you but once Truly I supposed he did Bella was nervous now and would have been glad to recall her question You thought it strange that feeling much interested in you I should start at what sounded like a proposal to bring you into contact with the murdered man who lies in his grave I might have known of course in a moment should have known that it could not have that meaning But my interest remains Re entering the

your Boffins You can have as much flirting as you like at your Boffins But you won t take ME to your Boffins I can tell you you and your Boffins too If quoth mister George Sampson moodily pulling his stopper out Miss Bella s mister Boffin comes any more of his nonsense to ME I only wish him to understand as betwixt man and man that he does it at his per and was going to say peril but Miss Lavinia having no confidence in his mental powers and feeling his oration to have no definite application to any circumstances jerked his stopper in again with a sharpness that made his eyes water And now the worthy missus Wilfer having used her youngest daughter as a lay figure for the edification of these Boffins became bland to her and proceeded to develop her last instance of force of character which was still in reserve This was to illuminate the family with her remarkable powers as a physiognomist powers that terrified R W when ever let loose as being always fraught with gloom and evil which no inferior prescience was aware of And this missus Wilfer now did be it observed in jealousy of these Boffins in the very same moments when she was already reflecting how she would flourish these very same Boffins and the state they kept over the heads of her Boffinless friends Of their manners said missus Wilfer I say nothing Of their appearance I say nothing Of the disinterestedness of their intentions towards Bella I say nothing But the craft the secrecy the dark deep underhanded plotting written in missus Boffin s countenance make me shudder As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there missus Wilfer shuddered on the spot

500_125123_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Wards of his perhaps 
500_125123_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Yet that can scarcely be for they are older than himself Veneering has been in their confidence throughout and has done much to lure them to the altar 
500_125123_000005_000004	train-clean-360	He has mentioned to Twemlow how he said to missus Veneering Anastatia this must be a match He has mentioned to Twemlow how he regards Sophronia Akershem the mature young lady in the light of a sister and Alfred Lammle the mature young gentleman in the light of a brother 
1027_125147_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Lammle

500_125123_000005_000006	train-clean-360	He has answered Not exactly Whether Sophronia was adopted by his mother 
500_125123_000005_000007	train-clean-360	He has answered Not precisely so Twemlow s hand has gone to his forehead with a lost air 
none	none	But two or three weeks ago Twemlow sitting over his newspaper and over his dry toast and weak tea and over the stable yard in Duke Street saint James s received a highly perfumed cocked hat and monogram from missus Veneering entreating her dearest mister T if not particularly engaged that day to come like a charming soul and make a fourth at dinner with dear mister Podsnap for the discussion of an interesting family topic the last three words doubly underlined and pointed with a note of admiration And Twemlow replying Not engaged and more than delighted goes and this takes place
500_125123_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Twemlow says Veneering your ready response to Anastatia s unceremonious invitation is truly kind and like an old old friend 
none	none	You know our dear friend Podsnap Twemlow ought to know the dear friend Podsnap who covered him with so much confusion and he says he does know him and Podsnap reciprocates Apparently Podsnap has been so wrought upon in a short time as to believe that he has been intimate in the house many many many years In the friendliest manner he is making himself quite at home with his back to the fire executing a statuette of the Colossus at Rhodes Twemlow has before noticed in his feeble way how soon the Veneering guests become infected with the Veneering fiction 
500_125123_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Not however that he has the least notion of its being his own case 
500_125123_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Our friends Alfred and Sophronia pursues Veneering the veiled prophet our friends Alfred and Sophronia you will be glad to hear my dear fellows are going to be married 
500_125123_000009_000001	train-clean-360	As my wife and I make it a family affair the entire direction of which we take upon ourselves of course our first step is to communicate the fact to our family friends 
500_125123_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh thinks Twemlow with his eyes on Podsnap then there are only two of us and he s the other 
500_125123_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I did hope Veneering goes on to have had Lady Tippins to meet you but she is always in request and is unfortunately engaged 
none	none	Oh thinks Twemlow with his eyes wandering then there are three of us and SHE S the other
500_125123_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Mortimer Lightwood resumes Veneering whom you both know is out of town but he writes in his whimsical manner that as we ask him to be bridegroom s best man when the ceremony takes place he will not refuse though he doesn t see what he has to do with it 
500_125123_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh thinks Twemlow with his eyes rolling then there are four of us and HE S the other 
none	none	Boots and Brewer observes Veneering whom you also know I have not asked to day but I reserve them for the occasion
500_125123_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Then thinks Twemlow with his eyes shut there are si But here collapses and does not completely recover until dinner is over and the Analytical has been requested to withdraw 
500_125123_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 We now come says Veneering to the point the real point of our little family consultation 
500_125123_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Sophronia having lost both father and mother has no one to give her away 
none	none	Give her away yourself says Podsnap
500_125123_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Podsnap no 
none	none	For three reasons 
500_125123_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Firstly because I couldn t take so much upon myself when I have respected family friends to remember 
500_125123_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Secondly because I am not so vain as to think that I look the part 
500_125123_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Thirdly because Anastatia is a little superstitious on the subject and feels averse to my giving away anybody until baby is old enough to be married 
none	none	What would happen if he did Podsnap inquires of missus Veneering
500_125123_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear mister Podsnap it s very foolish I know but I have an instinctive presentiment that if Hamilton gave away anybody else first he would never give away baby Thus missus Veneering with her open hands pressed together and each of her eight aquiline fingers looking so very like her one aquiline nose that the bran new jewels on them seem necessary for distinction s sake 
500_125123_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear Podsnap quoth Veneering there IS a tried friend of our family who I think and hope you will agree with me Podsnap is the friend on whom this agreeable duty almost naturally devolves 
500_125123_000022_000001	train-clean-360	That friend saying the words as if the company were about a hundred and fifty in number is now among us 
500_125123_000022_000002	train-clean-360	That friend is Twemlow 
500_125123_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly From Podsnap 
500_125123_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 That friend Veneering repeats with greater firmness is our dear good Twemlow 
none	none	And I cannot sufficiently express to you my dear Podsnap the pleasure I feel in having this opinion of mine and Anastatia s so readily confirmed by you that other equally familiar and tried friend who stands in the proud position I mean who proudly stands in the position or I ought rather to say who places Anastatia and myself in the proud position of himself standing in the simple position of baby s godfather And indeed Veneering is much relieved in mind to find that Podsnap betrays no jealousy of Twemlow s elevation So it has come to pass that the spring van is strewing flowers on the rosy hours and on the staircase and that Twemlow is surveying the ground on which he is to play his distinguished part to morrow He has already been to the church and taken note of the various impediments in the aisle under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the pews and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism but is in fact voluntarily doubled up to act as a money box And now Veneering shoots out of the Study wherein he is accustomed when contemplative to give his mind to the carving and gilding of the Pilgrims going to Canterbury in order to show Twemlow the little flourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion describing how that on the seventeenth instant at saint James s Church the Reverend Blank Blank assisted by the Reverend Dash Dash united in the bonds of matrimony
1027_125147_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 Alfred Lammle Esquire 
none	none	of Sackville Street Piccadilly to Sophronia only daughter of the late Horatio Akershem Esquire of Yorkshire 
500_125123_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Also how the fair bride was married from the house of Hamilton Veneering Esquire of Stucconia and was given away by Melvin Twemlow Esquire of Duke Street saint James s second cousin to Lord Snigsworth of Snigsworthy Park 
500_125123_000026_000002	train-clean-360	While perusing which composition Twemlow makes some opaque approach to perceiving that if the Reverend Blank Blank and the Reverend Dash Dash fail after this introduction to become enrolled in the list of Veneering s dearest and oldest friends they will have none but themselves to thank for it 
none	none	After which appears Sophronia whom Twemlow has seen twice in his lifetime to thank Twemlow for counterfeiting the late Horatio Akershem Esquire broadly of Yorkshire 
500_125123_000027_000001	train-clean-360	And after her appears Alfred whom Twemlow has seen once in his lifetime to do the same and to make a pasty sort of glitter as if he were constructed for candle light only and had been let out into daylight by some grand mistake 
none	none	And after that comes missus Veneering in a pervadingly aquiline state of figure and with transparent little knobs on her temper like the little transparent knob on the bridge of her nose Worn out by worry and excitement as she tells her dear mister Twemlow and reluctantly revived with curacoa by the Analytical And after that the bridesmaids begin to come by rail road from various parts of the country and to come like adorable recruits enlisted by a sergeant not present for on arriving at the Veneering depot they are in a barrack of strangers So Twemlow goes home to Duke Street saint James s to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it and a look at the marriage service in order that he may cut in at the right place to morrow and he is low and feels it dull over the livery stable yard and is distinctly aware of a dint in his heart made by the most adorable of the adorable bridesmaids For the poor little harmless gentleman once had his fancy like the rest of us and she didn t answer as she often does not and he thinks the adorable bridesmaid is like the fancy as she was then which she is not at all and that if the fancy had not married some one else for money but had married him for love he and she would have been happy which they wouldn t have been and that she has a tenderness for him still whereas her toughness is a proverb Brooding over the fire with his dried little head in his dried little hands and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees Twemlow is melancholy No Adorable to bear me company here thinks he No Adorable at the club 
500_125123_000028_000005	train-clean-360	A waste a waste a waste my Twemlow And so drops asleep and has galvanic starts all over him 
none	none	Betimes next morning that horrible old Lady Tippins relict of the late Sir Thomas Tippins knighted in mistake for somebody else by His Majesty King George the Third who while performing the ceremony was graciously pleased to observe What what what 
500_125123_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Who who who Why why why begins to be dyed and varnished for the interesting occasion

500_125123_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Whereabout in the bonnet and drapery announced by her name any fragment of the real woman may be concealed is perhaps known to her maid but you could easily buy all you see of her in Bond Street or you might scalp her and peel her and scrape her and make two Lady Tippinses out of her and yet not penetrate to the genuine article 
500_125123_000029_000004	train-clean-360	She has a large gold eye glass has Lady Tippins to survey the proceedings with 
none	none	If she had one in each eye it might keep that other drooping lid up and look more uniform But perennial youth is in her artificial flowers and her list of lovers is full
500_125123_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Mortimer you wretch says Lady Tippins turning the eyeglass about and about where is your charge the bridegroom 
none	none	Give you my honour returns Mortimer I don t know and I don t care Miserable 
500_125123_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Is that the way you do your duty 
none	none	Beyond an impression that he is to sit upon my knee and be seconded at some point of the solemnities like a principal at a prizefight I assure you I have no notion what my duty is returns Mortimer 
500_125123_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Eugene is also in attendance with a pervading air upon him of having presupposed the ceremony to be a funeral and of being disappointed 
none	none	The scene is the Vestry room of saint James s Church with a number of leathery old registers on shelves that might be bound in Lady Tippinses 
500_125123_000035_000000	train-clean-360	But hark 
500_125123_000035_000001	train-clean-360	A carriage at the gate and Mortimer s man arrives looking rather like a spurious Mephistopheles and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman s family 
500_125123_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Whom Lady Tippins surveying through her eye glass considers a fine man and quite a catch and of whom Mortimer remarks in the lowest spirits as he approaches I believe this is my fellow confound him More carriages at the gate and lo the rest of the characters 
500_125123_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Whom Lady Tippins standing on a cushion surveying through the eye glass thus checks off

500_125123_000035_000007	train-clean-360	missus Veneering never saw such velvet say two thousand pounds as she stands absolute jeweller s window father must have been a pawnbroker or how could these people do it 
500_125123_000035_000008	train-clean-360	Attendant unknowns pokey 
500_125123_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Ceremony performed register signed Lady Tippins escorted out of sacred edifice by Veneering carriages rolling back to Stucconia servants with favours and flowers Veneering s house reached drawing rooms most magnificent

none	none	Here too are Boots and Brewer and the two other Buffers each Buffer with a flower in his button hole his hair curled and his gloves buttoned on tight apparently come prepared if anything had happened to the bridegroom to be married instantly Here too the bride s aunt and next relation a widowed female of a Medusa sort in a stoney cap glaring petrifaction at her fellow creatures Here too the bride s trustee an oilcake fed style of business gentleman with mooney spectacles and an object of much interest 
500_125123_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Veneering launching himself upon this trustee as his oldest friend which makes seven Twemlow thought and confidentially retiring with him into the conservatory it is understood that Veneering is his company trustee and that they are arranging about the fortune

500_125123_000036_000006	train-clean-360	Pokey unknowns amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering pluck up spirit fold their arms and begin to contradict him before breakfast 
500_125123_000036_000007	train-clean-360	What time missus Veneering carrying baby dressed as a bridesmaid flits about among the company emitting flashes of many coloured lightning from diamonds emeralds and rubies 
500_125123_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The Analytical in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to himself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on hand with the pastrycook s men announces breakfast 
none	none	Dining room no less magnificent than drawing room tables superb all the camels out and all laden 
500_125123_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Splendid cake covered with Cupids silver and true lovers knots 
500_125123_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Splendid bracelet produced by Veneering before going down and clasped upon the arm of bride 
none	none	Yet nobody seems to think much more of the Veneerings than if they were a tolerable landlord and landlady doing the thing in the way of business at so much a head The bride and bridegroom talk and laugh apart as has always been their manner and the Buffers work their way through the dishes with systematic perseverance as has always been THEIR manner and the pokey unknowns are exceedingly benevolent to one another in invitations to take glasses of champagne but missus Podsnap arching her mane and rocking her grandest has a far more deferential audience than missus Veneering and Podsnap all but does the honours 
500_125123_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Another dismal circumstance is that Veneering having the captivating Tippins on one side of him and the bride s aunt on the other finds it immensely difficult to keep the peace 
none	none	For Medusa besides unmistakingly glaring petrifaction at the fascinating Tippins follows every lively remark made by that dear creature with an audible snort which may be referable to a chronic cold in the head but may also be referable to indignation and contempt 
500_125123_000038_000002	train-clean-360	And this snort being regular in its reproduction at length comes to be expected by the company who make embarrassing pauses when it is falling due and by waiting for it render it more emphatic when it comes 
none	none	The stoney aunt has likewise an injurious way of rejecting all dishes whereof Lady Tippins partakes saying aloud when they are proffered to her No no no not for me Take it away As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if nourished upon similar meats she might come to be like that charmer which would be a fatal consummation 
500_125123_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Aware of her enemy Lady Tippins tries a youthful sally or two and tries the eye glass but from the impenetrable cap and snorting armour of the stoney aunt all weapons rebound powerless 
500_125123_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Another objectionable circumstance is that the pokey unknowns support each other in being unimpressible 
500_125123_000039_000001	train-clean-360	They persist in not being frightened by the gold and silver camels and they are banded together to defy the elaborately chased ice pails 
500_125123_000039_000002	train-clean-360	They even seem to unite in some vague utterance of the sentiment that the landlord and landlady will make a pretty good profit out of this and they almost carry themselves like customers 
none	none	Nor is there compensating influence in the adorable bridesmaids for having very little interest in the bride and none at all in one another those lovely beings become each one of her own account depreciatingly contemplative of the millinery present while the bridegroom s man exhausted in the back of his chair appears to be improving the occasion by penitentially contemplating all the wrong he has ever done the difference between him and his friend Eugene being that the latter in the back of HIS chair appears to be contemplating all the wrong he would like to do particularly to the present company 
500_125123_000040_000000	train-clean-360	In which state of affairs the usual ceremonies rather droop and flag and the splendid cake when cut by the fair hand of the bride has but an indigestible appearance 
none	none	However all the things indispensable to be said are said and all the things indispensable to be done are done including Lady Tippins s yawning falling asleep and waking insensible and there is hurried preparation for the nuptial journey to the Isle of Wight and the outer air teems with brass bands and spectators In full sight of whom the malignant star of the Analytical has pre ordained that pain and ridicule shall befall him For he standing on the doorsteps to grace the departure is suddenly caught a most prodigious thump on the side of his head with a heavy shoe which a Buffer in the hall champagne flushed and wild of aim has borrowed on the spur of the moment from the pastrycook s porter to cast after the departing pair as an auspicious omen So they all go up again into the gorgeous drawing rooms all of them flushed with breakfast as having taken scarlatina sociably and there the combined unknowns do malignant things with their legs to ottomans and take as much as possible out of the splendid furniture And so Lady Tippins quite undetermined whether today is the day before yesterday or the day after to morrow or the week after next fades away and Mortimer Lightwood and Eugene fade away and Twemlow fades away and the stoney aunt goes away she declines to fade proving rock to the last and even the unknowns are slowly strained off and it is all over 
500_125123_000042_000000	train-clean-360	All over that is to say for the time being 
500_125123_000042_000001	train-clean-360	But there is another time to come and it comes in about a fortnight and it comes to mister and missus Lammle on the sands at Shanklin in the Isle of Wight 
none	none	mister and missus Lammle have walked for some time on the Shanklin sands and one may see by their footprints that they have not walked arm in arm and that they have not walked in a straight track and that they have walked in a moody humour for the lady has prodded little spirting holes in the damp sand before her with her parasol and the gentleman has trailed his stick after him 
500_125123_000043_000001	train-clean-360	As if he were of the Mephistopheles family indeed and had walked with a drooping tail

500_125123_000047_000000	train-clean-360	mister Lammle falls silent again and they walk as before

500_125123_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 The face too replied missus Lammle staring at him with cold scorn Pray how dare you sir utter the word to me 
none	none	I never did As this happens to be true missus Lammle is thrown on the feminine resource of saying I don t care what you uttered or did not utter 
500_125123_000059_000000	train-clean-360	After a little more walking and a little more silence mister Lammle breaks the latter 
none	none	You shall proceed in your own way 
500_125123_000060_000001	train-clean-360	You claim a right to ask me do I mean to tell you 
500_125123_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Do I mean to tell you what 
500_125123_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 That you are a man of property 
none	none	No
500_125123_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you married me on false pretences 
none	none	So be it Next comes what you mean to say Do you mean to say you are a woman of property No Then you married me on false pretences
500_125123_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 If you were so dull a fortune hunter that you deceived yourself or if you were so greedy and grasping that you were over willing to be deceived by appearances is it my fault you adventurer the lady demands with great asperity 
500_125123_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 I asked Veneering 
500_125123_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I asked Veneering and he told me you were rich 
500_125123_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Veneering with great contempt And what does Veneering know about me 
500_125123_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Was he not your trustee 
none	none	No 
500_125123_000071_000001	train-clean-360	I have no trustee but the one you saw on the day when you fraudulently married me 
none	none	And his trust is not a very difficult one for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds I think there are some odd shillings or pence if you are very particular 
500_125123_000072_000000	train-clean-360	mister Lammle bestows a by no means loving look upon the partner of his joys and sorrows and he mutters something but checks himself 
500_125123_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Question for question 
none	none	It is my turn again missus Lammle What made you suppose me a man of property
500_125123_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 You made me suppose you so 
none	none	Perhaps you will deny that you always presented yourself to me in that character
500_125123_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 But you asked somebody too 
none	none	Come missus Lammle admission for admission You asked somebody I asked Veneering And Veneering knew as much of me as he knew of you or as anybody knows of him After more silent walking the bride stops short to say in a passionate manner I never will forgive the Veneerings for this
500_125123_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Neither will I returns the bridegroom 
500_125123_000081_000000	train-clean-360	With that they walk again she making those angry spirts in the sand he dragging that dejected tail 
none	none	The tide is low and seems to have thrown them together high on the bare shore A gull comes sweeping by their heads and flouts them There was a golden surface on the brown cliffs but now and behold they are only damp earth 
500_125123_000081_000004	train-clean-360	A taunting roar comes from the sea and the far out rollers mount upon one another to look at the entrapped impostors and to join in impish and exultant gambols 
500_125123_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you pretend to believe missus Lammle resumes sternly when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself 
none	none	Again there are two sides to the question missus Lammle 
500_125123_000083_000001	train-clean-360	What do you pretend to believe 
none	none	So you first deceive me and then insult me cries the lady with a heaving bosom Not at all 
500_125123_000085_000001	train-clean-360	I have originated nothing 
none	none	The double edged question was yours
500_125123_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Was mine the bride repeats and her parasol breaks in her angry hand 
none	none	His colour has turned to a livid white and ominous marks have come to light about his nose as if the finger of the very devil himself had within the last few moments touched it here and there But he has repressive power and she has none
500_125123_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Throw it away he coolly recommends as to the parasol you have made it useless you look ridiculous with it 
500_125123_000089_000000	train-clean-360	Whereupon she calls him in her rage A deliberate villain and so casts the broken thing from her as that it strikes him in falling 
none	none	The finger marks are something whiter for the instant but he walks on at her side She bursts into tears declaring herself the wretchedest the most deceived the worst used of women 
500_125123_000090_000001	train-clean-360	Then she says that if she had the courage to kill herself she would do it 
500_125123_000090_000002	train-clean-360	Then she calls him vile impostor 
500_125123_000090_000003	train-clean-360	Then she asks him why in the disappointment of his base speculation he does not take her life with his own hand under the present favourable circumstances 
500_125123_000090_000004	train-clean-360	Then she cries again 
none	none	Then she is enraged again and makes some mention of swindlers Finally she sits down crying on a block of stone and is in all the known and unknown humours of her sex at once Pending her changes those aforesaid marks in his face have come and gone now here now there like white steps of a pipe on which the diabolical performer has played a tune 
500_125123_000090_000008	train-clean-360	Also his livid lips are parted at last as if he were breathless with running Yet he is not 
none	none	Now 
500_125123_000096_000003	train-clean-360	get up 
none	none	missus Lammle and let us speak reasonably 
500_125123_000092_000000	train-clean-360	She sits upon her stone and takes no heed of him 
500_125123_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Get up I tell you 
500_125123_000094_000000	train-clean-360	Raising her head she looks contemptuously in his face and repeats You tell me 
500_125123_000094_000001	train-clean-360	Tell me forsooth 
none	none	She affects not to know that his eyes are fastened on her as she droops her head again but her whole figure reveals that she knows it uneasily Enough of this Come 
500_125123_000096_000002	train-clean-360	Do you hear 
none	none	Get up Yielding to his hand she rises and they walk again but this time with their faces turned towards their place of residence missus Lammle we have both been deceiving and we have both been deceived We have both been biting and we have both been bitten 
500_125123_000098_000002	train-clean-360	In a nut shell there s the state of the case 
500_125123_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 You sought me out 
none	none	Tut Let us have done with that WE know very well how it was Why should you and I talk about it when you and I can t disguise it To proceed 
500_125123_000100_000005	train-clean-360	I am disappointed and cut a poor figure 
500_125123_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Am I no one 
none	none	Some one and I was coming to you if you had waited a moment 
500_125123_000102_000001	train-clean-360	You too are disappointed and cut a poor figure 
500_125123_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 An injured figure 
500_125123_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 You are now cool enough Sophronia to see that you can t be injured without my being equally injured and that therefore the mere word is not to the purpose 
500_125123_000104_000001	train-clean-360	When I look back I wonder how I can have been such a fool as to take you to so great an extent upon trust 
500_125123_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 And when I look back the bride cries interrupting 
500_125123_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 And when you look back you wonder how you can have been you ll excuse the word 
none	none	Most certainly with so much reason Such a fool as to take ME to so great an extent upon trust But the folly is committed on both sides 
500_125123_000108_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot get rid of you you cannot get rid of me 
none	none	What follows Shame and misery the bride bitterly replies I don t know 
500_125123_000110_000001	train-clean-360	A mutual understanding follows and I think it may carry us through 
500_125123_000110_000002	train-clean-360	Here I split my discourse give me your arm Sophronia into three heads to make it shorter and plainer 
500_125123_000110_000003	train-clean-360	Firstly it s enough to have been done without the mortification of being known to have been done 
500_125123_000110_000004	train-clean-360	So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves 
none	none	You agree If it is possible I do Possible 
500_125123_000112_000001	train-clean-360	We have pretended well enough to one another 
none	none	Can t we united pretend to the world Agreed 
500_125123_000112_000004	train-clean-360	Secondly we owe the Veneerings a grudge and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in as we ourselves have been taken in 
none	none	Agreed Yes Agreed
500_125123_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 We come smoothly to thirdly 
none	none	You have called me an adventurer Sophronia So I am In plain uncomplimentary English so I am 
500_125123_000114_000004	train-clean-360	So are you my dear 
500_125123_000114_000005	train-clean-360	So are many people 
500_125123_000114_000006	train-clean-360	We agree to keep our own secret and to work together in furtherance of our own schemes 
500_125123_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 What schemes 
none	none	Any scheme that will bring us money By our own schemes I mean our joint interest Agreed 
500_125123_000117_000000	train-clean-360	She answers after a little hesitation I suppose so 
none	none	Agreed Carried at once you see 
500_125123_000118_000001	train-clean-360	Now Sophronia only half a dozen words more We know one another perfectly 
none	none	Don t be tempted into twitting me with the past knowledge that you have of me because it is identical with the past knowledge that I have of you and in twitting me you twit yourself and I don t want to hear you do it With this good understanding established between us it is better never done 
500_125123_000118_000004	train-clean-360	To wind up all You have shown temper today Sophronia 
none	none	Don t be betrayed into doing so again because I have a Devil of a temper myself 
500_125123_000119_000000	train-clean-360	So the happy pair with this hopeful marriage contract thus signed sealed and delivered repair homeward 
500_125123_000119_000001	train-clean-360	If when those infernal finger marks were on the white and breathless countenance of Alfred Lammle Esquire they denoted that he conceived the purpose of subduing his dear wife missus Alfred Lammle by at once divesting her of any lingering reality or pretence of self respect the purpose would seem to have been presently executed 
500_125123_000119_000002	train-clean-360	The mature young lady has mighty little need of powder now for her downcast face as he escorts her in the light of the setting sun to their abode of bliss 
none	none	Chapter eleven PODSNAPPERY mister Podsnap was well to do and stood very high in mister Podsnap s opinion Beginning with a good inheritance he had married a good inheritance and had thriven exceedingly in the Marine Insurance way and was quite satisfied He never could make out why everybody was not quite satisfied and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example in being particularly well satisfied with most things and above all other things with himself Thus happily acquainted with his own merit and importance mister Podsnap settled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence There was a dignified conclusiveness not to add a grand convenience in this way of getting rid of disagreeables which had done much towards establishing mister Podsnap in his lofty place in mister Podsnap s satisfaction I don t want to know about it I don t choose to discuss it I don t admit it mister Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish of his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems by sweeping them behind him and consequently sheer away with those words and a flushed face For they affronted him mister Podsnap s world was not a very large world morally no nor even geographically seeing that although his business was sustained upon commerce with other countries he considered other countries with that important reservation a mistake and of their manners and customs would conclusively observe Not English when PRESTO with a flourish of the arm and a flush of the face they were swept away Elsewhere the world got up at eight shaved close at a quarter past breakfasted at nine went to the City at ten came home at half past five and dined at seven mister Podsnap s notions of the Arts in their integrity might have been stated thus Literature large print respectfully descriptive of getting up at eight shaving close at a quarter past breakfasting at nine going to the City at ten coming home at half past five and dining at seven Painting and Sculpture models and portraits representing Professors of getting up at eight shaving close at a quarter past breakfasting at nine going to the City at ten coming home at half past five and dining at seven Music a respectable performance without variations on stringed and wind instruments sedately expressive of getting up at eight shaving close at a quarter past breakfasting at nine going to the City at ten coming home at half past five and dining at seven Nothing else to be permitted to those same vagrants the Arts on pain of excommunication Nothing else To Be anywhere As a so eminently respectable man mister Podsnap was sensible of its being required of him to take Providence under his protection Consequently he always knew exactly what Providence meant Inferior and less respectable men might fall short of that mark but mister Podsnap was always up to it And it was very remarkable and must have been very comfortable that what Providence meant was invariably what mister Podsnap meant These may be said to have been the articles of a faith and school which the present chapter takes the liberty of calling after its representative man Podsnappery They were confined within close bounds as mister Podsnap s own head was confined by his shirt collar and they were enunciated with a sounding pomp that smacked of the creaking of mister Podsnap s own boots There was a Miss Podsnap And this young rocking horse was being trained in her mother s art of prancing in a stately manner without ever getting on But the high parental action was not yet imparted to her and in truth she was but an undersized damsel with high shoulders low spirits chilled elbows and a rasped surface of nose who seemed to take occasional frosty peeps out of childhood into womanhood and to shrink back again overcome by her mother s head dress and her father from head to foot crushed by the mere dead weight of Podsnappery A certain institution in mister Podsnap s mind which he called the young person may be considered to have been embodied in Miss Podsnap his daughter It was an inconvenient and exacting institution as requiring everything in the universe to be filed down and fitted to it The question about everything was would it bring a blush into the cheek of the young person And the inconvenience of the young person was that according to mister Podsnap she seemed always liable to burst into blushes when there was no need at all There appeared to be no line of demarcation between the young person s excessive innocence and another person s guiltiest knowledge Take mister Podsnap s word for it and the soberest tints of drab white lilac and grey were all flaming red to this troublesome Bull of a young person The Podsnaps lived in a shady angle adjoining Portman Square They were a kind of people certain to dwell in the shade wherever they dwelt Miss Podsnap s life had been from her first appearance on this planet altogether of a shady order for mister Podsnap s young person was likely to get little good out of association with other young persons and had therefore been restricted to companionship with not very congenial older persons and with massive furniture Miss Podsnap s early views of life being principally derived from the reflections of it in her father s boots and in the walnut and rosewood tables of the dim drawing rooms and in their swarthy giants of looking glasses were of a sombre cast and it was not wonderful that now when she was on most days solemnly tooled through the Park by the side of her mother in a great tall custard coloured phaeton she showed above the apron of that vehicle like a dejected young person sitting up in bed to take a startled look at things in general and very strongly desiring to get her head under the counterpane again Said mister Podsnap to missus Podsnap Georgiana is almost eighteen Said missus Podsnap to mister Podsnap assenting Almost eighteen Said mister Podsnap then to missus Podsnap Really I think we should have some people on Georgiana s birthday Said missus Podsnap then to mister Podsnap Which will enable us to clear off all those people who are due So it came to pass that mister and missus Podsnap requested the honour of the company of seventeen friends of their souls at dinner and that they substituted other friends of their souls for such of the seventeen original friends of their souls as deeply regretted that a prior engagement prevented their having the honour of dining with mister and missus Podsnap in pursuance of their kind invitation and that missus Podsnap said of all these inconsolable personages as she checked them off with a pencil in her list Asked at any rate and got rid of and that they successfully disposed of a good many friends of their souls in this way and felt their consciences much lightened There were still other friends of their souls who were not entitled to be asked to dinner but had a claim to be invited to come and take a haunch of mutton vapour bath at half past nine For the clearing off of these worthies missus Podsnap added a small and early evening to the dinner and looked in at the music shop to bespeak a well conducted automaton to come and play quadrilles for a carpet dance mister and missus Veneering and mister and missus Veneering s bran new bride and bridegroom were of the dinner company but the Podsnap establishment had nothing else in common with the Veneerings mister Podsnap could tolerate taste in a mushroom man who stood in need of that sort of thing but was far above it himself Hideous solidity was the characteristic of the Podsnap plate Everything was made to look as heavy as it could and to take up as much room as possible Everything said boastfully Here you have as much of me in my ugliness as if I were only lead but I am so many ounces of precious metal worth so much an ounce wouldn t you like to melt me down A corpulent straddling epergne blotched all over as if it had broken out in an eruption rather than been ornamented delivered this address from an unsightly silver platform in the centre of the table Four silver wine coolers each furnished with four staring heads each head obtrusively carrying a big silver ring in each of its ears conveyed the sentiment up and down the table and handed it on to the pot bellied silver salt cellars All the big silver spoons and forks widened the mouths of the company expressly for the purpose of thrusting the sentiment down their throats with every morsel they ate The majority of the guests were like the plate and included several heavy articles weighing ever so much But there was a foreign gentleman among them whom mister Podsnap had invited after much debate with himself believing the whole European continent to be in mortal alliance against the young person and there was a droll disposition not only on the part of mister Podsnap but of everybody else to treat him as if he were a child who was hard of hearing As a delicate concession to this unfortunately born foreigner mister Podsnap in receiving him had presented his wife as Madame Podsnap also his daughter as Mademoiselle Podsnap with some inclination to add ma fille in which bold venture however he checked himself The Veneerings being at that time the only other arrivals he had added in a condescendingly explanatory manner Monsieur Vey nair reeng and had then subsided into English How Do You Like London mister Podsnap now inquired from his station of host as if he were administering something in the nature of a powder or potion to the deaf child London Londres London The foreign gentleman admired it You find it Very Large said mister Podsnap spaciously The foreign gentleman found it very large And Very Rich The foreign gentleman found it without doubt enormement riche Enormously Rich We say returned mister Podsnap in a condescending manner Our English adverbs do Not terminate in Mong and We Pronounce the ch as if there were a t before it We say Ritch Reetch remarked the foreign gentleman And Do You Find Sir pursued mister Podsnap with dignity Many Evidences that Strike You of our British Constitution in the Streets Of The World s Metropolis London Londres London The foreign gentleman begged to be pardoned but did not altogether understand The Constitution Britannique mister Podsnap explained as if he were teaching in an infant school We Say British But You Say Britannique You Know forgivingly as if that were not his fault The Constitution Sir The foreign gentleman said Mais yees I know eem A youngish sallowish gentleman in spectacles with a lumpy forehead seated in a supplementary chair at a corner of the table here caused a profound sensation by saying in a raised voice ESKER and then stopping dead Mais oui said the foreign gentleman turning towards him Est ce que Quoi donc But the gentleman with the lumpy forehead having for the time delivered himself of all that he found behind his lumps spake for the time no more I Was Inquiring said mister Podsnap resuming the thread of his discourse Whether You Have Observed in our Streets as We should say Upon our Pavvy as You would say any Tokens The foreign gentleman with patient courtesy entreated pardon But what was tokenz Marks said mister Podsnap Signs you know Appearances Traces Ah Of a Orse inquired the foreign gentleman We call it Horse said mister Podsnap with forbearance In England Angleterre England We Aspirate the H and We Say Horse Only our Lower Classes Say Orse Pardon said the foreign gentleman I am alwiz wrong Our Language said mister Podsnap with a gracious consciousness of being always right is Difficult Ours is a Copious Language and Trying to Strangers I will not Pursue my Question But the lumpy gentleman unwilling to give it up again madly said ESKER and again spake no more It merely referred mister Podsnap explained with a sense of meritorious proprietorship to Our Constitution Sir We Englishmen are Very Proud of our Constitution Sir It Was Bestowed Upon Us By Providence No Other Country is so Favoured as This Country And ozer countries the foreign gentleman was beginning when mister Podsnap put him right again We do not say Ozer we say Other the letters are T and H You say Tay and Aish You Know still with clemency The sound is th th And OTHER countries said the foreign gentleman They do how They do Sir returned mister Podsnap gravely shaking his head they do I am sorry to be obliged to say it AS they do It was a little particular of Providence said the foreign gentleman laughing for the frontier is not large Undoubtedly assented mister Podsnap But So it is It was the Charter of the Land This Island was Blest Sir to the Direct Exclusion of such Other Countries as as there may happen to be And if we were all Englishmen present I would say added mister Podsnap looking round upon his compatriots and sounding solemnly with his theme that there is in the Englishman a combination of qualities a modesty an independence a responsibility a repose combined with an absence of everything calculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person which one would seek in vain among the Nations of the Earth Having delivered this little summary mister Podsnap s face flushed as he thought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by any prejudiced citizen of any other country and with his favourite right arm flourish he put the rest of Europe and the whole of Asia Africa and America nowhere The audience were much edified by this passage of words and mister Podsnap feeling that he was in rather remarkable force to day became smiling and conversational Has anything more been heard Veneering he inquired of the lucky legatee Nothing more returned Veneering than that he has come into possession of the property I am told people now call him The Golden Dustman I mentioned to you some time ago I think that the young lady whose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine Yes you told me that said Podsnap and by the bye I wish you would tell it again here for it s a curious coincidence curious that the first news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your table when I was there and curious that one of your people should have been so nearly interested in it Just relate that will you Veneering was more than ready to do it for he had prospered exceedingly upon the Harmon Murder and had turned the social distinction it conferred upon him to the account of making several dozen of bran new bosom friends Indeed such another lucky hit would almost have set him up in that way to his satisfaction So addressing himself to the most desirable of his neighbours while missus Veneering secured the next most desirable he plunged into the case and emerged from it twenty minutes afterwards with a Bank Director in his arms In the mean time missus Veneering had dived into the same waters for a wealthy Ship Broker and had brought him up safe and sound by the hair Then missus Veneering had to relate to a larger circle how she had been to see the girl and how she was really pretty and considering her station presentable And this she did with such a successful display of her eight aquiline fingers and their encircling jewels that she happily laid hold of a drifting General Officer his wife and daughter and not only restored their animation which had become suspended but made them lively friends within an hour Although mister Podsnap would in a general way have highly disapproved of Bodies in rivers as ineligible topics with reference to the cheek of the young person he had as one may say a share in this affair which made him a part proprietor As its returns were immediate too in the way of restraining the company from speechless contemplation of the wine coolers it paid and he was satisfied And now the haunch of mutton vapour bath having received a gamey infusion and a few last touches of sweets and coffee was quite ready and the bathers came but not before the discreet automaton had got behind the bars of the piano music desk and there presented the appearance of a captive languishing in a rose wood jail And who now so pleasant or so well assorted as mister and missus Alfred Lammle he all sparkle she all gracious contentment both at occasional intervals exchanging looks like partners at cards who played a game against All England There was not much youth among the bathers but there was no youth the young person always excepted in the articles of Podsnappery Bald bathers folded their arms and talked to mister Podsnap on the hearthrug sleek whiskered bathers with hats in their hands lunged at missus Podsnap and retreated prowling bathers went about looking into ornamental boxes and bowls as if they had suspicions of larceny on the part of the Podsnaps and expected to find something they had lost at the bottom bathers of the gentler sex sat silently comparing ivory shoulders All this time and always poor little Miss Podsnap whose tiny efforts if she had made any were swallowed up in the magnificence of her mother s rocking kept herself as much out of sight and mind as she could and appeared to be counting on many dismal returns of the day It was somehow understood as a secret article in the state proprieties of Podsnappery that nothing must be said about the day Consequently this young damsel s nativity was hushed up and looked over as if it were agreed on all hands that it would have been better that she had never been born The Lammles were so fond of the dear Veneerings that they could not for some time detach themselves from those excellent friends but at length either a very open smile on mister Lammle s part or a very secret elevation of one of his gingerous eyebrows certainly the one or the other seemed to say to missus Lammle Why don t you play And so looking about her she saw Miss Podsnap and seeming to say responsively That card and to be answered Yes went and sat beside Miss Podsnap missus Lammle was overjoyed to escape into a corner for a little quiet talk It promised to be a very quiet talk for Miss Podsnap replied in a flutter Oh Indeed it s very kind of you but I am afraid I DON T talk Let us make a beginning said the insinuating missus Lammle with her best smile Oh I am afraid you ll find me very dull But Ma talks That was plainly to be seen for Ma was talking then at her usual canter with arched head and mane opened eyes and nostrils Fond of reading perhaps Yes At least I don t mind that so much returned Miss Podsnap M m m m music So insinuating was missus Lammle that she got half a dozen ms into the word before she got it out I haven t nerve to play even if I could Ma plays At exactly the same canter and with a certain flourishing appearance of doing something Ma did in fact occasionally take a rock upon the instrument Of course you like dancing Oh no I don t said Miss Podsnap No With your youth and attractions Truly my dear you surprise me I can t say observed Miss Podsnap after hesitating considerably and stealing several timid looks at missus Lammle s carefully arranged face how I might have liked it if I had been a you won t mention it WILL you My dear Never No I am sure you won t I can t say then how I should have liked it if I had been a chimney sweep on May day Gracious was the exclamation which amazement elicited from missus Lammle There I knew you d wonder But you won t mention it will you Upon my word my love said missus Lammle you make me ten times more desirous now I talk to you to know you well than I was when I sat over yonder looking at you How I wish we could be real friends Try me as a real friend Come Don t fancy me a frumpy old married woman my dear I was married but the other day you know I am dressed as a bride now you see About the chimney sweeps Hush Ma ll hear She can t hear from where she sits Don t you be too sure of that said Miss Podsnap in a lower voice Well what I mean is that they seem to enjoy it And that perhaps you would have enjoyed it if you had been one of them Miss Podsnap nodded significantly Then you don t enjoy it now How is it possible said Miss Podsnap Oh it is such a dreadful thing If I was wicked enough and strong enough to kill anybody it should be my partner This was such an entirely new view of the Terpsichorean art as socially practised that missus Lammle looked at her young friend in some astonishment Her young friend sat nervously twiddling her fingers in a pinioned attitude as if she were trying to hide her elbows But this latter Utopian object in short sleeves always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence It sounds horrid don t it said Miss Podsnap with a penitential face missus Lammle not very well knowing what to answer resolved herself into a look of smiling encouragement But it is and it always has been pursued Miss Podsnap such a trial to me I so dread being awful And it is so awful No one knows what I suffered at Madame Sauteuse s where I learnt to dance and make presentation curtseys and other dreadful things or at least where they tried to teach me Ma can do it At any rate my love said missus Lammle soothingly that s over Yes it s over returned Miss Podsnap but there s nothing gained by that It s worse here than at Madame Sauteuse s Ma was there and Ma s here but Pa wasn t there and company wasn t there and there were not real partners there Oh there s Ma speaking to the man at the piano Oh there s Ma going up to somebody Oh I know she s going to bring him to me Oh please don t please don t please don t Oh keep away keep away keep away These pious ejaculations Miss Podsnap uttered with her eyes closed and her head leaning back against the wall But the Ogre advanced under the pilotage of Ma and Ma said Georgiana mister Grompus and the Ogre clutched his victim and bore her off to his castle in the top couple Then the discreet automaton who had surveyed his ground played a blossomless tuneless set and sixteen disciples of Podsnappery went through the figures of one Getting up at eight and shaving close at a quarter past two Breakfasting at nine three Going to the City at ten four Coming home at half past five five Dining at seven and the grand chain While these solemnities were in progress mister Alfred Lammle most loving of husbands approached the chair of missus Alfred Lammle most loving of wives and bending over the back of it trifled for some few seconds with missus Lammle s bracelet Slightly in contrast with this brief airy toying one might have noticed a certain dark attention in missus Lammle s face as she said some words with her eyes on mister Lammle s waistcoat and seemed in return to receive some lesson But it was all done as a breath passes from a mirror And now the grand chain riveted to the last link the discreet automaton ceased and the sixteen two and two took a walk among the furniture And herein the unconsciousness of the Ogre Grompus was pleasantly conspicuous for that complacent monster believing that he was giving Miss Podsnap a treat prolonged to the utmost stretch of possibility a peripatetic account of an archery meeting while his victim heading the procession of sixteen as it slowly circled about like a revolving funeral never raised her eyes except once to steal a glance at missus Lammle expressive of intense despair At length the procession was dissolved by the violent arrival of a nutmeg before which the drawing room door bounced open as if it were a cannon ball and while that fragrant article dispersed through several glasses of coloured warm water was going the round of society Miss Podsnap returned to her seat by her new friend Oh my goodness said Miss Podsnap THAT S over I hope you didn t look at me My dear why not Oh I know all about myself said Miss Podsnap I ll tell you something I know about you my dear returned missus Lammle in her winning way and that is you are most unnecessarily shy Ma ain t said Miss Podsnap I detest you Go along This shot was levelled under her breath at the gallant Grompus for bestowing an insinuating smile upon her in passing Pardon me if I scarcely see my dear Miss Podsnap missus Lammle was beginning when the young lady interposed If we are going to be real friends and I suppose we are for you are the only person who ever proposed it don t let us be awful It s awful enough to BE Miss Podsnap without being called so Call me Georgiana Dearest Georgiana missus Lammle began again Thank you said Miss Podsnap Dearest Georgiana pardon me if I scarcely see my love why your mamma s not being shy is a reason why you should be Don t you really see that asked Miss Podsnap plucking at her fingers in a troubled manner and furtively casting her eyes now on missus Lammle now on the ground Then perhaps it isn t My dearest Georgiana you defer much too readily to my poor opinion Indeed it is not even an opinion darling for it is only a confession of my dullness Oh YOU are not dull returned Miss Podsnap I am dull but you couldn t have made me talk if you were Some little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having gained a purpose called bloom enough into missus Lammle s face to make it look brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear Georgiana and shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness Not that it meant anything but that Georgiana seemed to like it What I mean is pursued Georgiana that Ma being so endowed with awfulness and Pa being so endowed with awfulness and there being so much awfulness everywhere I mean at least everywhere where I am perhaps it makes me who am so deficient in awfulness and frightened at it I say it very badly I don t know whether you can understand what I mean Perfectly dearest Georgiana missus Lammle was proceeding with every reassuring wile when the head of that young lady suddenly went back against the wall again and her eyes closed Oh there s Ma being awful with somebody with a glass in his eye Oh I know she s going to bring him here Oh don t bring him don t bring him Oh he ll be my partner with his glass in his eye Oh what shall I do This time Georgiana accompanied her ejaculations with taps of her feet upon the floor and was altogether in quite a desperate condition But there was no escape from the majestic missus Podsnap s production of an ambling stranger with one eye screwed up into extinction and the other framed and glazed who having looked down out of that organ as if he descried Miss Podsnap at the bottom of some perpendicular shaft brought her to the surface and ambled off with her And then the captive at the piano played another set expressive of his mournful aspirations after freedom and other sixteen went through the former melancholy motions and the ambler took Miss Podsnap for a furniture walk as if he had struck out an entirely original conception In the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour who had wandered to the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in conference with mister Podsnap eliminated mister Podsnap s flush and flourish by a highly unpolite remark no less than a reference to the circumstance that some half dozen people had lately died in the streets of starvation It was clearly ill timed after dinner It was not adapted to the cheek of the young person It was not in good taste I don t believe it said mister Podsnap putting it behind him The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved because there were the Inquests and the Registrar s returns Then it was their own fault said mister Podsnap Veneering and other elders of tribes commended this way out of it At once a short cut and a broad road The man of meek demeanour intimated that truly it would seem from the facts as if starvation had been forced upon the culprits in question as if in their wretched manner they had made their weak protests against it as if they would have taken the liberty of staving it off if they could as if they would rather not have been starved upon the whole if perfectly agreeable to all parties There is not said mister Podsnap flushing angrily there is not a country in the world sir where so noble a provision is made for the poor as in this country The meek man was quite willing to concede that but perhaps it rendered the matter even worse as showing that there must be something appallingly wrong somewhere Where said mister Podsnap The meek man hinted Wouldn t it be well to try very seriously to find out where Ah said mister Podsnap Easy to say somewhere not so easy to say where But I see what you are driving at I knew it from the first Centralization No Never with my consent Not English An approving murmur arose from the heads of tribes as saying There you have him Hold him He was not aware the meek man submitted of himself that he was driving at any ization He had no favourite ization that he knew of But he certainly was more staggered by these terrible occurrences than he was by names of howsoever so many syllables Might he ask was dying of destitution and neglect necessarily English You know what the population of London is I suppose said mister Podsnap The meek man supposed he did but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it if its laws were well administered And you know at least I hope you know said mister Podsnap with severity that Providence has declared that you shall have the poor always with you The meek man also hoped he knew that I am glad to hear it said mister Podsnap with a portentous air I am glad to hear it It will render you cautious how you fly in the face of Providence In reference to that absurd and irreverent conventional phrase the meek man said for which mister Podsnap was not responsible he the meek man had no fear of doing anything so impossible but But mister Podsnap felt that the time had come for flushing and flourishing this meek man down for good So he said I must decline to pursue this painful discussion It is not pleasant to my feelings it is repugnant to my feelings I have said that I do not admit these things I have also said that if they do occur not that I admit it the fault lies with the sufferers themselves It is not for ME mister Podsnap pointed me forcibly as adding by implication though it may be all very well for YOU it is not for me to impugn the workings of Providence I know better than that I trust and I have mentioned what the intentions of Providence are Besides said mister Podsnap flushing high up among his hair brushes with a strong consciousness of personal affront the subject is a very disagreeable one I will go so far as to say it is an odious one It is not one to be introduced among our wives and young persons and I He finished with that flourish of his arm which added more expressively than any words And I remove it from the face of the earth Simultaneously with this quenching of the meek man s ineffectual fire Georgiana having left the ambler up a lane of sofa in a No Thoroughfare of back drawing room to find his own way out came back to missus Lammle And who should be with missus Lammle but mister Lammle So fond of her Alfred my love here is my friend Georgiana dearest girl you must like my husband next to me mister Lammle was proud to be so soon distinguished by this special commendation to Miss Podsnap s favour But if mister Lammle were prone to be jealous of his dear Sophronia s friendships he would be jealous of her feeling towards Miss Podsnap Say Georgiana darling interposed his wife Towards shall I Georgiana mister Lammle uttered the name with a delicate curve of his right hand from his lips outward For never have I known Sophronia who is not apt to take sudden likings so attracted and so captivated as she is by shall I once more Georgiana The object of this homage sat uneasily enough in receipt of it and then said turning to missus Lammle much embarrassed I wonder what you like me for I am sure I can t think Dearest Georgiana for yourself For your difference from all around you Well That may be For I think I like you for your difference from all around me said Georgiana with a smile of relief We must be going with the rest observed missus Lammle rising with a show of unwillingness amidst a general dispersal We are real friends Georgiana dear Real Good night dear girl She had established an attraction over the shrinking nature upon which her smiling eyes were fixed for Georgiana held her hand while she answered in a secret and half frightened tone Don t forget me when you are gone away And come again soon Good night Charming to see mister and missus Lammle taking leave so gracefully and going down the stairs so lovingly and sweetly Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage But to be sure that was a sight behind the scenes which nobody saw and which nobody was meant to see Certain big heavy vehicles built on the model of the Podsnap plate took away the heavy articles of guests weighing ever so much and the less valuable articles got away after their various manners and the Podsnap plate was put to bed As mister Podsnap stood with his back to the drawing room fire pulling up his shirtcollar like a veritable cock of the walk literally pluming himself in the midst of his possessions nothing would have astonished him more than an intimation that Miss Podsnap or any other young person properly born and bred could not be exactly put away like the plate brought out like the plate polished like the plate counted weighed and valued like the plate That such a young person could possibly have a morbid vacancy in the heart for anything younger than the plate or less monotonous than the plate or that such a young person s thoughts could try to scale the region bounded on the north south east and west by the plate was a monstrous imagination which he would on the spot have flourished into space This perhaps in some sort arose from mister Podsnap s blushing young person being so to speak all cheek whereas there is a possibility that there may be young persons of a rather more complex organization If mister Podsnap pulling up his shirt collar could only have heard himself called that fellow in a certain short dialogue which passed between mister and missus Lammle in their opposite corners of their little carriage rolling home Sophronia are you awake Am I likely to be asleep sir Very likely I should think after that fellow s company Attend to what I am going to say I have attended to what you have already said have I not What else have I been doing all to night Attend I tell you in a raised voice to what I am going to say Keep close to that idiot girl Keep her under your thumb You have her fast and you are not to let her go Do you hear I hear you I foresee there is money to be made out of this besides taking that fellow down a peg We owe each other money you know missus Lammle winced a little at the reminder but only enough to shake her scents and essences anew into the atmosphere of the little carriage as she settled herself afresh in her own dark corner Chapter twelve THE SWEAT OF AN HONEST MAN S BROW mister Mortimer Lightwood and mister Eugene Wrayburn took a coffee house dinner together in mister Lightwood s office They had newly agreed to set up a joint establishment together They had taken a bachelor cottage near Hampton on the brink of the Thames with a lawn and a boat house and all things fitting and were to float with the stream through the summer and the Long Vacation It was not summer yet but spring and it was not gentle spring ethereally mild as in Thomson s Seasons but nipping spring with an easterly wind as in Johnson s Jackson s Dickson s Smith s and Jones s Seasons The grating wind sawed rather than blew and as it sawed the sawdust whirled about the sawpit Every street was a sawpit and there were no top sawyers every passenger was an under sawyer with the sawdust blinding him and choking him That mysterious paper currency which circulates in London when the wind blows gyrated here and there and everywhere Whence can it come whither can it go It hangs on every bush flutters in every tree is caught flying by the electric wires haunts every enclosure drinks at every pump cowers at every grating shudders upon every plot of grass seeks rest in vain behind the legions of iron rails In Paris where nothing is wasted costly and luxurious city though it be but where wonderful human ants creep out of holes and pick up every scrap there is no such thing There it blows nothing but dust There sharp eyes and sharp stomachs reap even the east wind and get something out of it The wind sawed and the sawdust whirled The shrubs wrung their many hands bemoaning that they had been over persuaded by the sun to bud the young leaves pined the sparrows repented of their early marriages like men and women the colours of the rainbow were discernible not in floral spring but in the faces of the people whom it nibbled and pinched And ever the wind sawed and the sawdust whirled When the spring evenings are too long and light to shut out and such weather is rife the city which mister Podsnap so explanatorily called London Londres London is at its worst Such a black shrill city combining the qualities of a smoky house and a scolding wife such a gritty city such a hopeless city with no rent in the leaden canopy of its sky such a beleaguered city invested by the great Marsh Forces of Essex and Kent So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be as their dinner done they turned towards the fire to smoke Young Blight was gone the coffee house waiter was gone the plates and dishes were gone the wine was going but not in the same direction The wind sounds up here quoth Eugene stirring the fire as if we were keeping a lighthouse I wish we were Don t you think it would bore us Lightwood asked Not more than any other place And there would be no Circuit to go But that s a selfish consideration personal to me And no clients to come added Lightwood Not that that s a selfish consideration at all personal to ME If we were on an isolated rock in a stormy sea said Eugene smoking with his eyes on the fire Lady Tippins couldn t put off to visit us or better still might put off and get swamped People couldn t ask one to wedding breakfasts There would be no Precedents to hammer at except the plain sailing Precedent of keeping the light up It would be exciting to look out for wrecks But otherwise suggested Lightwood there might be a degree of sameness in the life I have thought of that also said Eugene as if he really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business but it would be a defined and limited monotony It would not extend beyond two people Now it s a question with me Mortimer whether a monotony defined with that precision and limited to that extent might not be more endurable than the unlimited monotony of one s fellow creatures As Lightwood laughed and passed the wine he remarked We shall have an opportunity in our boating summer of trying the question An imperfect one Eugene acquiesced with a sigh but so we shall I hope we may not prove too much for one another Now regarding your respected father said Lightwood bringing him to a subject they had expressly appointed to discuss always the most slippery eel of eels of subjects to lay hold of Yes regarding my respected father assented Eugene settling himself in his arm chair I would rather have approached my respected father by candlelight as a theme requiring a little artificial brilliancy but we will take him by twilight enlivened with a glow of Wallsend He stirred the fire again as he spoke and having made it blaze resumed My respected father has found down in the parental neighbourhood a wife for his not generally respected son With some money of course With some money of course or he would not have found her My respected father let me shorten the dutiful tautology by substituting in future M R F which sounds military and rather like the Duke of Wellington What an absurd fellow you are Eugene Not at all I assure you M R F having always in the clearest manner provided as he calls it for his children by pre arranging from the hour of the birth of each and sometimes from an earlier period what the devoted little victim s calling and course in life should be M R F pre arranged for myself that I was to be the barrister I am with the slight addition of an enormous practice which has not accrued and also the married man I am not The first you have often told me The first I have often told you Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny You know M R F but not as well as I do If you knew him as well as I do he would amuse you Filially spoken Eugene Perfectly so believe me and with every sentiment of affectionate deference towards M R F But if he amuses me I can t help it When my eldest brother was born of course the rest of us knew I mean the rest of us would have known if we had been in existence that he was heir to the Family Embarrassments we call it before the company the Family Estate But when my second brother was going to be born by and by this says M R F is a little pillar of the church WAS born and became a pillar of the church a very shaky one My third brother appeared considerably in advance of his engagement to my mother but M R F not at all put out by surprise instantly declared him a Circumnavigator Was pitch forked into the Navy but has not circumnavigated I announced myself and was disposed of with the highly satisfactory results embodied before you When my younger brother was half an hour old it was settled by M R F that he should have a mechanical genius And so on Therefore I say that M R F amuses me Touching the lady Eugene There M R F ceases to be amusing because my intentions are opposed to touching the lady Do you know her Not in the least Hadn t you better see her My dear Mortimer you have studied my character Could I possibly go down there labelled ELIGIBLE ON VIEW and meet the lady similarly labelled Anything to carry out M R F s arrangements I am sure with the greatest pleasure except matrimony Could I possibly support it I so soon bored so constantly so fatally But you are not a consistent fellow Eugene In susceptibility to boredom returned that worthy I assure you I am the most consistent of mankind Why it was but now that you were dwelling in the advantages of a monotony of two In a lighthouse Do me the justice to remember the condition In a lighthouse Mortimer laughed again and Eugene having laughed too for the first time as if he found himself on reflection rather entertaining relapsed into his usual gloom and drowsily said as he enjoyed his cigar No there is no help for it one of the prophetic deliveries of M R F must for ever remain unfulfilled With every disposition to oblige him he must submit to a failure It had grown darker as they talked and the wind was sawing and the sawdust was whirling outside paler windows The underlying churchyard was already settling into deep dim shade and the shade was creeping up to the housetops among which they sat As if said Eugene as if the churchyard ghosts were rising He had walked to the window with his cigar in his mouth to exalt its flavour by comparing the fireside with the outside when he stopped midway on his return to his arm chair and said Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way and dropped in to be directed Look at this phantom Lightwood whose back was towards the door turned his head and there in the darkness of the entry stood a something in the likeness of a man to whom he addressed the not irrelevant inquiry Who the devil are you I ask your pardons Governors replied the ghost in a hoarse double barrelled whisper but might either on you be Lawyer Lightwood What do you mean by not knocking at the door demanded Mortimer I ask your pardons Governors replied the ghost as before but probable you was not aware your door stood open What do you want Hereunto the ghost again hoarsely replied in its double barrelled manner I ask your pardons Governors but might one on you be Lawyer Lightwood One of us is said the owner of that name All right Governors Both returned the ghost carefully closing the room door tickler business Mortimer lighted the candles They showed the visitor to be an ill looking visitor with a squinting leer who as he spoke fumbled at an old sodden fur cap formless and mangey that looked like a furry animal dog or cat puppy or kitten drowned and decaying Now said Mortimer what is it Governors Both returned the man in what he meant to be a wheedling tone which on you might be Lawyer Lightwood I am Lawyer Lightwood ducking at him with a servile air I am a man as gets my living and as seeks to get my living by the sweat of my brow Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow by any chances I should wish afore going further to be swore in I am not a swearer in of people man The visitor clearly anything but reliant on this assurance doggedly muttered Alfred David Is that your name asked Lightwood My name returned the man No I want to take a Alfred David Which Eugene smoking and contemplating him interpreted as meaning Affidavit I tell you my good fellow said Lightwood with his indolent laugh that I have nothing to do with swearing He can swear AT you Eugene explained and so can I But we can t do more for you Much discomfited by this information the visitor turned the drowned dog or cat puppy or kitten about and about and looked from one of the Governors Both to the other of the Governors Both while he deeply considered within himself At length he decided Then I must be took down Where asked Lightwood Here said the man In pen and ink First let us know what your business is about It s about said the man taking a step forward dropping his hoarse voice and shading it with his hand it s about from five to ten thousand pound reward That s what it s about It s about Murder That s what it s about Come nearer the table Sit down Will you have a glass of wine Yes I will said the man and I don t deceive you Governors It was given him Making a stiff arm to the elbow he poured the wine into his mouth tilted it into his right cheek as saying What do you think of it tilted it into his left cheek as saying What do YOU think of it jerked it into his stomach as saying What do YOU think of it To conclude smacked his lips as if all three replied We think well of it Will you have another Yes I will he repeated and I don t deceive you Governors And also repeated the other proceedings Now began Lightwood what s your name Why there you re rather fast Lawyer Lightwood he replied in a remonstrant manner Don t you see Lawyer Lightwood There you re a little bit fast I m going to earn from five to ten thousand pound by the sweat of my brow and as a poor man doing justice to the sweat of my brow is it likely I can afford to part with so much as my name without its being took down Deferring to the man s sense of the binding powers of pen and ink and paper Lightwood nodded acceptance of Eugene s nodded proposal to take those spells in hand Eugene bringing them to the table sat down as clerk or notary Now said Lightwood what s your name But further precaution was still due to the sweat of this honest fellow s brow I should wish Lawyer Lightwood he stipulated to have that T other Governor as my witness that what I said I said Consequent will the T other Governor be so good as chuck me his name and where he lives Eugene cigar in mouth and pen in hand tossed him his card After spelling it out slowly the man made it into a little roll and tied it up in an end of his neckerchief still more slowly Now said Lightwood for the third time if you have quite completed your various preparations my friend and have fully ascertained that your spirits are cool and not in any way hurried what s your name Roger Riderhood Dwelling place Lime us Hole Calling or occupation Not quite so glib with this answer as with the previous two mister Riderhood gave in the definition Waterside character Anything against you Eugene quietly put in as he wrote Rather baulked mister Riderhood evasively remarked with an innocent air that he believed the T other Governor had asked him summa t Ever in trouble said Eugene Once Might happen to any man mister Riderhood added incidentally On suspicion of Of seaman s pocket said mister Riderhood Whereby I was in reality the man s best friend and tried to take care of him With the sweat of your brow asked Eugene Till it poured down like rain said Roger Riderhood Eugene leaned back in his chair and smoked with his eyes negligently turned on the informer and his pen ready to reduce him to more writing Lightwood also smoked with his eyes negligently turned on the informer Now let me be took down again said Riderhood when he had turned the drowned cap over and under and had brushed it the wrong way if it had a right way with his sleeve I give information that the man that done the Harmon Murder is Gaffer Hexam the man that found the body The hand of Jesse Hexam commonly called Gaffer on the river and along shore is the hand that done that deed His hand and no other The two friends glanced at one another with more serious faces than they had shown yet Tell us on what grounds you make this accusation said Mortimer Lightwood On the grounds answered Riderhood wiping his face with his sleeve that I was Gaffer s pardner and suspected of him many a long day and many a dark night On the grounds that I knowed his ways On the grounds that I broke the pardnership because I see the danger which I warn you his daughter may tell you another story about that for anythink I can say but you know what it ll be worth for she d tell you lies the world round and the heavens broad to save her father On the grounds that it s well understood along the cause ays and the stairs that he done it On the grounds that he s fell off from because he done it On the grounds that I will swear he done it On the grounds that you may take me where you will and get me sworn to it I don t want to back out of the consequences I have made up MY mind Take me anywheres All this is nothing said Lightwood Nothing repeated Riderhood indignantly and amazedly Merely nothing It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of the crime You may do so with some reason or you may do so with no reason but he cannot be convicted on your suspicion Haven t I said I appeal to the T other Governor as my witness haven t I said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here world without end everlasting chair he evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit that I was willing to swear that he done it Haven t I said Take me and get me sworn to it Don t I say so now You won t deny it Lawyer Lightwood Surely not but you only offer to swear to your suspicion and I tell you it is not enough to swear to your suspicion Not enough ain t it Lawyer Lightwood he cautiously demanded Positively not And did I say it WAS enough Now I appeal to the T other Governor Now fair Did I say so He certainly has not said that he had no more to tell Eugene observed in a low voice without looking at him whatever he seemed to imply Hah cried the informer triumphantly perceiving that the remark was generally in his favour though apparently not closely understanding it Fort nate for me I had a witness Go on then said Lightwood Say out what you have to say No after thought Let me be took down then cried the informer eagerly and anxiously Let me be took down for by George and the Draggin I m a coming to it now Don t do nothing to keep back from a honest man the fruits of the sweat of his brow I give information then that he told me that he done it Is THAT enough Take care what you say my friend returned Mortimer Lawyer Lightwood take care you what I say for I judge you ll be answerable for follering it up Then slowly and emphatically beating it all out with his open right hand on the palm of his left I Roger Riderhood Lime us Hole Waterside character tell you Lawyer Lightwood that the man Jesse Hexam commonly called upon the river and along shore Gaffer told me that he done the deed What s more he told me with his own lips that he done the deed What s more he said that he done the deed And I ll swear it Where did he tell you so Outside replied Riderhood always beating it out with his head determinedly set askew and his eyes watchfully dividing their attention between his two auditors outside the door of the Six Jolly Fellowships towards a quarter after twelve o clock at midnight but I will not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as five minutes on the night when he picked up the body The Six Jolly Fellowships won t run away If it turns out that he warn t at the Six Jolly Fellowships that night at midnight I m a liar What did he say I ll tell you take me down T other Governor I ask no better He come out first I come out last I might be a minute arter him I might be half a minute I might be a quarter of a minute I cannot swear to that and therefore I won t That s knowing the obligations of a Alfred David ain t it Go on I found him a waiting to speak to me He says to me Rogue Riderhood for that s the name I m mostly called by not for any meaning in it for meaning it has none but because of its being similar to Roger Never mind that Scuse ME Lawyer Lightwood it s a part of the truth and as such I do mind it and I must mind it and I will mind it Rogue Riderhood he says words passed betwixt us on the river tonight Which they had ask his daughter I threatened you he says to chop you over the fingers with my boat s stretcher or take a aim at your brains with my boathook I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow as if you was suspicious and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat I says to him Gaffer I know it He says to me Rogue Riderhood you are a man in a dozen I think he said in a score but of that I am not positive so take the lowest figure for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David And he says when your fellow men is up be it their lives or be it their watches sharp is ever the word with you Had you suspicions I says Gaffer I had and what s more I have He falls a shaking and he says Of what I says Of foul play He falls a shaking worse and he says There WAS foul play then I done it for his money Don t betray me Those were the words as ever he used There was a silence broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate An opportunity which the informer improved by smearing himself all over the head and neck and face with his drowned cap and not at all improving his own appearance What more asked Lightwood Of him d ye mean Lawyer Lightwood Of anything to the purpose Now I m blest if I understand you Governors Both said the informer in a creeping manner propitiating both though only one had spoken What Ain t THAT enough Did you ask him how he did it where he did it when he did it Far be it from me Lawyer Lightwood I was so troubled in my mind that I wouldn t have knowed more no not for the sum as I expect to earn from you by the sweat of my brow twice told I had put an end to the pardnership I had cut the connexion I couldn t undo what was done and when he begs and prays Old pardner on my knees don t split upon me I only makes answer Never speak another word to Roger Riderhood nor look him in the face and I shuns that man Having given these words a swing to make them mount the higher and go the further Rogue Riderhood poured himself out another glass of wine unbidden and seemed to chew it as with the half emptied glass in his hand he stared at the candles Mortimer glanced at Eugene but Eugene sat glowering at his paper and would give him no responsive glance Mortimer again turned to the informer to whom he said You have been troubled in your mind a long time man Giving his wine a final chew and swallowing it the informer answered in a single word Hages When all that stir was made when the Government reward was offered when the police were on the alert when the whole country rang with the crime said Mortimer impatiently Hah mister Riderhood very slowly and hoarsely chimed in with several retrospective nods of his head Warn t I troubled in my mind then When conjecture ran wild when the most extravagant suspicions were afloat when half a dozen innocent people might have been laid by the heels any hour in the day said Mortimer almost warming Hah mister Riderhood chimed in as before Warn t I troubled in my mind through it all But he hadn t said Eugene drawing a lady s head upon his writing paper and touching it at intervals the opportunity then of earning so much money you see The T other Governor hits the nail Lawyer Lightwood It was that as turned me I had many times and again struggled to relieve myself of the trouble on my mind but I couldn t get it off I had once very nigh got it off to Miss Abbey Potterson which keeps the Six Jolly Fellowships there is the ouse it won t run away there lives the lady she ain t likely to be struck dead afore you get there ask her but I couldn t do it At last out comes the new bill with your own lawful name Lawyer Lightwood printed to it and then I asks the question of my own intellects Am I to have this trouble on my mind for ever Am I never to throw it off Am I always to think more of Gaffer than of my own self If he s got a daughter ain t I got a daughter And echo answered Eugene suggested You have said mister Riderhood in a firm tone Incidentally mentioning at the same time her age inquired Eugene Yes governor Two and twenty last October And then I put it to myself Regarding the money It is a pot of money For it IS a pot said mister Riderhood with candour and why deny it Hear from Eugene as he touched his drawing It is a pot of money but is it a sin for a labouring man that moistens every crust of bread he earns with his tears or if not with them with the colds he catches in his head is it a sin for that man to earn it Say there is anything again earning it This I put to myself strong as in duty bound how can it be said without blaming Lawyer Lightwood for offering it to be earned And was it for ME to blame Lawyer Lightwood No No said Eugene
501_125128_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not 
none	none	Governor mister Riderhood acquiesced So I made up my mind to get my trouble off my mind and to earn by the sweat of my brow what was held out to me And what s more he added suddenly turning bloodthirsty I mean to have it And now I tell you once and away Lawyer Lightwood that Jesse Hexam commonly called Gaffer his hand and no other done the deed on his own confession to me And I give him up to you and I want him took This night After another silence broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate which attracted the informer s attention as if it were the chinking of money Mortimer Lightwood leaned over his friend and said in a whisper I suppose I must go with this fellow to our imperturbable friend at the police station I suppose said Eugene there is no help for it Do you believe him I believe him to be a thorough rascal But he may tell the truth for his own purpose and for this occasion only It doesn t look like it HE doesn t said Eugene But neither is his late partner whom he denounces a prepossessing person The firm are cut throat Shepherds both in appearance I should like to ask him one thing The subject of this conference sat leering at the ashes trying with all his might to overhear what was said but feigning abstraction as the Governors Both glanced at him You mentioned twice I think a daughter of this Hexam s said Eugene aloud You don t mean to imply that she had any guilty knowledge of the crime The honest man after considering perhaps considering how his answer might affect the fruits of the sweat of his brow replied unreservedly No I don t And you implicate no other person It ain t what I implicate it s what Gaffer implicated was the dogged and determined answer I don t pretend to know more than that his words to me was I done it Those was his words I must see this out Mortimer whispered Eugene rising How shall we go Let us walk whispered Lightwood and give this fellow time to think of it Having exchanged the question and answer they prepared themselves for going out and mister Riderhood rose While extinguishing the candles Lightwood quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk and coolly tossed it under the grate where it fell shivering into fragments Now if you will take the lead said Lightwood mister Wrayburn and I will follow You know where to go I suppose I suppose I do Lawyer Lightwood Take the lead then The waterside character pulled his drowned cap over his ears with both hands and making himself more round shouldered than nature had made him by the sullen and persistent slouch with which he went went down the stairs round by the Temple Church across the Temple into Whitefriars and so on by the waterside streets Look at his hang dog air said Lightwood following It strikes me rather as a hang MAN air returned Eugene He has undeniable intentions that way They said little else as they followed He went on before them as an ugly Fate might have done and they kept him in view and would have been glad enough to lose sight of him But on he went before them always at the same distance and the same rate Aslant against the hard implacable weather and the rough wind he was no more to be driven back than hurried forward but held on like an advancing Destiny There came when they were about midway on their journey a heavy rush of hail which in a few minutes pelted the streets clear and whitened them It made no difference to him A man s life being to be taken and the price of it got the hailstones to arrest the purpose must lie larger and deeper than those He crashed through them leaving marks in the fast melting slush that were mere shapeless holes one might have fancied following that the very fashion of humanity had departed from his feet The blast went by and the moon contended with the fast flying clouds and the wild disorder reigning up there made the pitiful little tumults in the streets of no account It was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky and the night were all in the air If he has had time to think of it said Eugene he has not had time to think better of it or differently of it if that s better There is no sign of drawing back in him and as I recollect this place we must be close upon the corner where we alighted that night In fact a few abrupt turns brought them to the river side where they had slipped about among the stones and where they now slipped more the wind coming against them in slants and flaws across the tide and the windings of the river in a furious way With that habit of getting under the lee of any shelter which waterside characters acquire the waterside character at present in question led the way to the leeside of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters before he spoke Look round here Lawyer Lightwood at them red curtains It s the Fellowships the ouse as I told you wouldn t run away And has it run away Not showing himself much impressed by this remarkable confirmation of the informer s evidence Lightwood inquired what other business they had there I wished you to see the Fellowships for yourself Lawyer Lightwood that you might judge whether I m a liar and now I ll see Gaffer s window for myself that we may know whether he s at home With that he crept away He ll come back I suppose murmured Lightwood Ay and go through with it murmured Eugene He came back after a very short interval indeed Gaffer s out and his boat s out His daughter s at home sitting a looking at the fire But there s some supper getting ready so Gaffer s expected I can find what move he s upon easy enough presently Then he beckoned and led the way again and they came to the police station still as clean and cool and steady as before saving that the flame of its lamp being but a lamp flame and only attached to the Force as an outsider flickered in the wind Also within doors mister Inspector was at his studies as of yore He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared but their reappearance had no effect on his composure Not even the circumstance that Riderhood was their conductor moved him otherwise than that as he took a dip of ink he seemed by a settlement of his chin in his stock to propound to that personage without looking at him the question What have YOU been up to last Mortimer Lightwood asked him would he be so good as look at those notes Handing him Eugene s Having read the first few lines mister Inspector mounted to that for him extraordinary pitch of emotion that he said Does either of you two gentlemen happen to have a pinch of snuff about him Finding that neither had he did quite as well without it and read on Have you heard these read he then demanded of the honest man No said Riderhood Then you had better hear them And so read them aloud in an official manner Are these notes correct now as to the information you bring here and the evidence you mean to give he asked when he had finished reading They are They are as correct returned mister Riderhood as I am I can t say more than that for em I ll take this man myself sir said mister Inspector to Lightwood Then to Riderhood Is he at home Where is he What s he doing You have made it your business to know all about him no doubt Riderhood said what he did know and promised to find out in a few minutes what he didn t know Stop said mister Inspector not till I tell you We mustn t look like business Would you two gentlemen object to making a pretence of taking a glass of something in my company at the Fellowships Well conducted house and highly respectable landlady They replied that they would be happy to substitute a reality for the pretence which in the main appeared to be as one with mister Inspector s meaning Very good said he taking his hat from its peg and putting a pair of handcuffs in his pocket as if they were his gloves Reserve Reserve saluted You know where to find me Reserve again saluted Riderhood when you have found out concerning his coming home come round to the window of Cosy tap twice at it and wait for me Now gentlemen As the three went out together and Riderhood slouched off from under the trembling lamp his separate way Lightwood asked the officer what he thought of this mister Inspector replied with due generality and reticence that it was always more likely that a man had done a bad thing than that he hadn t That he himself had several times reckoned up Gaffer but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total That if this story was true it was only in part true That the two men very shy characters would have been jointly and pretty equally in it but that this man had spotted the other to save himself and get the money And I think added mister Inspector in conclusion that if all goes well with him he s in a tolerable way of getting it But as this is the Fellowships gentlemen where the lights are I recommend dropping the subject You can t do better than be interested in some lime works anywhere down about Northfleet and doubtful whether some of your lime don t get into bad company as it comes up in barges You hear Eugene said Lightwood over his shoulder You are deeply interested in lime Without lime returned that unmoved barrister at law my existence would be unilluminated by a ray of hope Chapter thirteen TRACKING THE BIRD OF PREY The two lime merchants with their escort entered the dominions of Miss Abbey Potterson to whom their escort presenting them and their pretended business over the half door of the bar in a confidential way preferred his figurative request that a mouthful of fire might be lighted in Cosy 
483-125126-0000	train-other-500	Always well disposed to assist the constituted authorities Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to that retreat and promptly enliven it with fire and gaslight
483-125126-0001	train-other-500	Of this commission the bare armed Bob leading the way with a flaming wisp of paper so speedily acquitted himself that Cosy seemed to leap out of a dark sleep and embrace them warmly the moment they passed the lintels of its hospitable door
483-125126-0002	train-other-500	They burn sherry very well here said mister Inspector as a piece of local intelligence Perhaps you gentlemen might like a bottle The answer being By all means
483-125126-0003	train-other-500	Bob Gliddery received his instructions from mister Inspector and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law It s a certain fact said mister Inspector that this man we have received our information from
none	none	 indicating Riderhood with his thumb over his shoulder 
483-125126-0004	train-other-500	has for some time past given the other man a bad name arising out of your lime barges and that the other man has been avoided in consequence I don t say what it means or proves but it s a certain fact
483-125126-0005	train-other-500	I had it first from one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance vaguely indicating Miss Abbey with his thumb over his shoulder down away at a distance over yonder Then probably mister Inspector was not quite unprepared for their visit that evening
483-125126-0006	train-other-500	Lightwood hinted Well you see said mister Inspector it was a question of making a move It s of no use moving if you don t know what your move is You had better by far keep still
483-125126-0007	train-other-500	In the matter of this lime I certainly had an idea that it might lie betwixt the two men I always had that idea Still I was forced to wait for a start and I wasn t so lucky as to get a start
none	none	 This man that we have received our information from has got a start and if he don t meet with a check he may make the running and come in first 
483-125126-0008	train-other-500	There may turn out to be something considerable for him that comes in second and I don t mention who may or who may not try for that place
none	none	 There s duty to do and I shall do it under any circumstances to the best of my judgment and ability Speaking as a shipper of lime 
483-125126-0009	train-other-500	began Eugene Which no man has a better right to do than yourself you know said mister Inspector I hope not said Eugene my father having been a shipper of lime before me and my grandfather before him
483-125126-0010	train-other-500	in fact we having been a family immersed to the crowns of our heads in lime during several generations
none	none	 I beg to observe that if this missing lime could be got hold of without any young female relative of any distinguished gentleman engaged in the lime trade 
483-125126-0011	train-other-500	which I cherish next to my life being present I think it might be a more agreeable proceeding to the assisting bystanders that is to say lime burners I also said Lightwood pushing his friend aside with a laugh should much prefer that
483-125126-0012	train-other-500	It shall be done gentlemen if it can be done conveniently said mister Inspector with coolness There is no wish on my part to cause any distress in that quarter Indeed I am sorry for that quarter There was a boy in that quarter
483-125126-0013	train-other-500	remarked Eugene He is still there No said mister Inspector He has quitted those works He is otherwise disposed of Will she be left alone then asked Eugene She will be left said mister Inspector
483-125126-0014	train-other-500	alone Bob s reappearance with a steaming jug broke off the conversation But although the jug steamed forth a delicious perfume its contents had not received that last happy touch which the surpassing finish of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters imparted on such momentous occasions
483-125126-0015	train-other-500	Bob carried in his left hand one of those iron models of sugar loaf hats before mentioned into which he emptied the jug and the pointed end of which he thrust deep down into the fire so leaving it for a few moments while he disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking glasses
483-125126-0016	train-other-500	Placing these on the table and bending over the fire meritoriously sensible of the trying nature of his duty he watched the wreaths of steam
none	none	 until at the special instant of projection he caught up the iron vessel and gave it one delicate twirl 
483-125126-0017	train-other-500	causing it to send forth one gentle hiss Then he restored the contents to the jug held over the steam of the jug each of the three bright glasses in succession finally filled them all and with a clear conscience awaited the applause of his fellow creatures It was bestowed
483-125126-0018	train-other-500	mister Inspector having proposed as an appropriate sentiment The lime trade and Bob withdrew to report the commendations of the guests to Miss Abbey in the bar
none	none	 It may be here in confidence admitted that the room being close shut in his absence there had not appeared to be the slightest reason for the elaborate maintenance of this same lime fiction 
483-125126-0019	train-other-500	Only it had been regarded by mister Inspector as so uncommonly satisfactory and so fraught with mysterious virtues that neither of his clients had presumed to question it Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window
483-125126-0020	train-other-500	mister Inspector hastily fortifying himself with another glass strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies This is becoming grim Mortimer said Eugene in a low voice
483-125126-0021	train-other-500	I don t like this Nor I said Lightwood Shall we go Being here let us stay You ought to see it out and I won t leave you Besides that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head
none	none	 It was little more than a glimpse we had of her that last time and yet I almost see her waiting by the fire to night 
483-125126-0022	train-other-500	Do you feel like a dark combination of traitor and pickpocket when you think of that girl Rather returned Lightwood Do you Very much so Their escort strolled back again and reported
483-125126-0023	train-other-500	Divested of its various lime lights and shadows his report went to the effect that Gaffer was away in his boat supposed to be on his old look out that he had been expected last high water
483-125126-0024	train-other-500	that having missed it for some reason or other he was not according to his usual habits at night to be counted on before next high water or it might be an hour or so later that his daughter surveyed through the window would seem to be so expecting him for the supper was not cooking but set out ready to be cooked
483-125126-0025	train-other-500	that it would be high water at about one and that it was now barely ten that there was nothing to be done but watch and wait that the informer was keeping watch at the instant of that present reporting but that two heads were better than one especially when the second was mister Inspector s
none	none	 and that the reporter meant to share the watch 
483-125126-0026	train-other-500	And forasmuch as crouching under the lee of a hauled up boat on a night when it blew cold and strong and when the weather was varied with blasts of hail at times
none	none	 might be wearisome to amateurs the reporter closed with the recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain for a while at any rate in their present quarters which were weather tight and warm 
483-125126-0027	train-other-500	They were not inclined to dispute this recommendation but they wanted to know where they could join the watchers when so disposed Rather than trust to a verbal description of the place which might mislead
483-125126-0028	train-other-500	Eugene with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had would go out with mister Inspector note the spot and come back On the shelving bank of the river among the slimy stones of a causeway
483-125126-0029	train-other-500	not the special causeway of the Six Jolly Fellowships which had a landing place of its own but another a little removed and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man s dwelling place were a few boats some moored and already beginning to float others hauled up above the reach of the tide
483-125126-0030	train-other-500	Under one of these latter Eugene s companion disappeared
none	none	 And when Eugene had observed its position with reference to the other boats and had made sure that he could not miss it he turned his eyes upon the building where as he had been told the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire 
483-125126-0031	train-other-500	He could see the light of the fire shining through the window Perhaps it drew him on to look in Perhaps he had come out with the express intention
483-125126-0032	train-other-500	That part of the bank having rank grass growing on it there was no difficulty in getting close without any noise of footsteps it was but to scramble up a ragged face of pretty hard mud some three or four feet high and come upon the grass and to the window He came to the window by that means
483-125126-0033	train-other-500	She had no other light than the light of the fire The unkindled lamp stood on the table She sat on the ground looking at the brazier with her face leaning on her hand
483-125126-0034	train-other-500	There was a kind of film or flicker on her face which at first he took to be the fitful firelight but on a second look he saw that she was weeping A sad and solitary spectacle as shown him by the rising and the falling of the fire
483-125126-0035	train-other-500	It was a little window of but four pieces of glass and was not curtained he chose it because the larger window near it was It showed him the room and the bills upon the wall respecting the drowned people starting out and receding by turns
483-125126-0036	train-other-500	But he glanced slightly at them though he looked long and steadily at her
none	none	 A deep rich piece of colour with the brown flush of her cheek and the shining lustre of her hair though sad and solitary weeping by the rising and the falling of the fire 
483-125126-0037	train-other-500	She started up He had been so very still that he felt sure it was not he who had disturbed her so merely withdrew from the window and stood near it in the shadow of the wall She opened the door and said in an alarmed tone Father was that you calling me
501_125127_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Father was that you calling me 
501_125127_000046_000007	train-clean-360	Father was that you calling me 
483-125126-0038	train-other-500	And again Father And once again after listening Father I thought I heard you call me twice before
501_125127_000046_000002	train-clean-360	I thought I heard you call me twice before 
483-125126-0039	train-other-500	No response As she re entered at the door he dropped over the bank and made his way back among the ooze and near the hiding place to Mortimer Lightwood to whom he told what he had seen of the girl and how this was becoming very grim indeed
483-125126-0040	train-other-500	If the real man feels as guilty as I do said Eugene he is remarkably uncomfortable Influence of secrecy suggested Lightwood
none	none	 I am not at all obliged to it for making me Guy Fawkes in the vault and a Sneak in the area both at once said Eugene 
483-125126-0041	train-other-500	Give me some more of that stuff
none	none	 Lightwood helped him to some more of that stuff but it had been cooling and didn t answer now Pooh said Eugene spitting it out among the ashes 
483-125126-0042	train-other-500	Tastes like the wash of the river Are you so familiar with the flavour of the wash of the river I seem to be to night I feel as if I had been half drowned and swallowing a gallon of it Influence of locality suggested Lightwood
483-125126-0043	train-other-500	You are mighty learned to night you and your influences returned Eugene How long shall we stay here How long do you think If I could choose I should say a minute replied Eugene
483-125126-0044	train-other-500	for the Jolly Fellowship Porters are not the jolliest dogs I have known But I suppose we are best here until they turn us out with the other suspicious characters at midnight
none	none	 Thereupon he stirred the fire and sat down on one side of it It struck eleven and he made believe to compose himself patiently But gradually he took the fidgets in one leg and then in the other leg and then in one arm and then in the other arm and then in his chin and then in his back and then in his forehead and then in his hair and then in his nose and then he stretched himself recumbent on two chairs and groaned and then he started up Invisible insects of diabolical activity swarm in this place I am tickled and twitched all over Mentally I have now committed a burglary under the meanest circumstances and the myrmidons of justice are at my heels 
483-125126-0045	train-other-500	I am quite as bad said Lightwood sitting up facing him with a tumbled head after going through some wonderful evolutions in which his head had been the lowest part of him This restlessness began with me long ago
none	none	 All the time you were out I felt like Gulliver with the Lilliputians firing upon him 
483-125126-0046	train-other-500	It won t do Mortimer We must get into the air we must join our dear friend and brother Riderhood
none	none	 And let us tranquillize ourselves by making a compact 
483-125126-0047	train-other-500	Next time with a view to our peace of mind we ll commit the crime instead of taking the criminal You swear it Certainly Sworn Let Tippins look to it Her life s in danger
483-125126-0048	train-other-500	Mortimer rang the bell to pay the score and Bob appeared to transact that business with him whom Eugene in his careless extravagance asked if he would like a situation in the lime trade Thankee sir no sir said Bob I ve a good sitiwation here sir
483-125126-0049	train-other-500	If you change your mind at any time returned Eugene come to me at my works and you ll always find an opening in the lime kiln Thankee sir said Bob This is my partner
483-125126-0050	train-other-500	said Eugene who keeps the books and attends to the wages A fair day s wages for a fair day s work is ever my partner s motto And a very good un it is gentlemen
none	none	 said Bob receiving his fee and drawing a bow out of his head with his right hand very much as he would have drawn a pint of beer out of the beer engine Eugene 
483-125126-0051	train-other-500	Mortimer apostrophized him laughing quite heartily when they were alone again how CAN you be so ridiculous I am in a ridiculous humour quoth Eugene I am a ridiculous fellow Everything is ridiculous Come along
483-125126-0052	train-other-500	It passed into Mortimer Lightwood s mind that a change of some sort best expressed perhaps as an intensification of all that was wildest and most negligent and reckless in his friend had come upon him in the last half hour or so
483-125126-0053	train-other-500	Thoroughly used to him as he was he found something new and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing This passed into his mind and passed out again but he remembered it afterwards
none	none	 There s where she sits you see 
483-125126-0054	train-other-500	said Eugene when they were standing under the bank roared and riven at by the wind There s the light of her fire I ll take a peep through the window
none	none	 said Mortimer No don t Eugene caught him by the arm Best not make a show of her 
483-125126-0055	train-other-500	Come to our honest friend He led him to the post of watch and they both dropped down and crept under the lee of the boat
none	none	 a better shelter than it had seemed before being directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night mister Inspector at home whispered Eugene 
483-125126-0056	train-other-500	Here I am sir And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there Good Anything happened His daughter has been out thinking she heard him calling unless it was a sign to him to keep out of the way It might have been
483-125126-0057	train-other-500	It might have been Rule Britannia muttered Eugene but it wasn t Mortimer Here On the other side of mister Inspector Two burglaries now and a forgery
483-125126-0058	train-other-500	With this indication of his depressed state of mind Eugene fell silent They were all silent for a long while As it got to be flood tide and the water came nearer to them noises on the river became more frequent and they listened more
483-125126-0059	train-other-500	To the turning of steam paddles to the clinking of iron chain to the creaking of blocks to the measured working of oars to the occasional violent barking of some passing dog on shipboard who seemed to scent them lying in their hiding place
483-125126-0060	train-other-500	The night was not so dark but that besides the lights at bows and mastheads gliding to and fro they could discern some shadowy bulk attached and now and then a ghostly lighter with a large dark sail like a warning arm would start up very near them pass on and vanish
483-125126-0061	train-other-500	At this time of their watch the water close to them would be often agitated by some impulsion given it from a distance
none	none	 Often they believed this beat and plash to be the boat they lay in wait for running in ashore and again and again they would have started up 
483-125126-0062	train-other-500	but for the immobility with which the informer well used to the river kept quiet in his place
none	none	 The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city church clocks for those lay to leeward of them 
483-125126-0063	train-other-500	but there were bells to windward that told them of its being One Two Three Without that aid they would have known how the night wore by the falling of the tide recorded in the appearance of an ever widening black wet strip of shore
none	none	 and the emergence of the paved causeway from the river foot by foot 
483-125126-0064	train-other-500	As the time so passed this slinking business became a more and more precarious one
none	none	 It would seem as if the man had had some intimation of what was in hand against him or had taken fright 
483-125126-0065	train-other-500	His movements might have been planned to gain for him in getting beyond their reach twelve hours advantage The honest man who had expended the sweat of his brow became uneasy and began to complain with bitterness of the proneness of mankind to cheat him him invested with the dignity of Labour
483-125126-0066	train-other-500	Their retreat was so chosen that while they could watch the river they could watch the house No one had passed in or out since the daughter thought she heard the father calling No one could pass in or out without being seen But it will be light at five said mister Inspector
483-125126-0067	train-other-500	and then WE shall be seen Look here said Riderhood what do you say to this He may have been lurking in and out and just holding his own betwixt two or three bridges for hours back What do you make of that said mister Inspector
483-125126-0068	train-other-500	Stoical but contradictory He may be doing so at this present time What do you make of that said mister Inspector My boat s among them boats here at the cause ay
483-125126-0069	train-other-500	And what do you make of your boat said mister Inspector What if I put off in her and take a look round
none	none	 I know his ways and the likely nooks he favours I know where he d be at such a time of the tide and where he d be at such another time Ain t I been his pardner None of you need show None of you need stir I can shove her off without help and as to me being seen I m about at all times 
483-125126-0070	train-other-500	You might have given a worse opinion said mister Inspector after brief consideration Try it Stop a bit Let s work it out If I want you I ll drop round under the Fellowships and tip you a whistle
483-125126-0071	train-other-500	If I might so far presume as to offer a suggestion to my honourable and gallant friend whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach Eugene struck in with great deliberation
none	none	 it would be that to tip a whistle is to advertise mystery and invite speculation 
483-125126-0072	train-other-500	My honourable and gallant friend will I trust excuse me as an independent member for throwing out a remark which I feel to be due to this house and the country Was that the T other Governor or Lawyer Lightwood asked Riderhood
483-125126-0073	train-other-500	For they spoke as they crouched or lay without seeing one another s faces In reply to the question put by my honourable and gallant friend said Eugene who was lying on his back with his hat on his face
none	none	 as an attitude highly expressive of watchfulness 
483-125126-0074	train-other-500	I can have no hesitation in replying it not being inconsistent with the public service that those accents were the accents of the T other Governor You ve tolerable good eyes ain t you Governor You ve all tolerable good eyes ain t you
483-125126-0075	train-other-500	demanded the informer All
none	none	 Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there no need to whistle 
483-125126-0076	train-other-500	You ll make out that there s a speck of something or another there and you ll know it s me and you ll come down that cause ay to me Understood all Understood all Off she goes then In a moment with the wind cutting keenly at him sideways he was staggering down to his boat
483-125126-0077	train-other-500	in a few moments he was clear and creeping up the river under their own shore Eugene had raised himself on his elbow to look into the darkness after him I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend he murmured lying down again and speaking into his hat
483-125126-0078	train-other-500	may be endowed with philanthropy enough to turn bottom upward and extinguish him Mortimer My honourable friend Three burglaries two forgeries and a midnight assassination
483-125126-0079	train-other-500	Yet in spite of having those weights on his conscience Eugene was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs So were his two companions Its being a change was everything The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease and to have begun afresh from a recent date
483-125126-0080	train-other-500	There was something additional to look for They were all three more sharply on the alert and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time More than an hour had passed and they were even dozing when one of the three each said it was he and he had NOT dozed
483-125126-0081	train-other-500	made out Riderhood in his boat at the spot agreed on They sprang up came out from their shelter and went down to him When he saw them coming he dropped alongside the causeway so that they standing on the causeway could speak with him in whispers under the shadowy mass of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters fast asleep
483-125126-0082	train-other-500	Blest if I can make it out said he staring at them Make what out Have you seen him No What HAVE you seen asked Lightwood
none	none	 For he was staring at them in the strangest way I ve seen his boat Not empty Yes empty And what s more adrift And what s more with one scull gone And what s more with t other scull jammed in the thowels and broke short off And what s more the boat s drove tight by the tide atwixt two tiers of barges And what s more he s in luck again by George if he ain t Chapter fourteen THE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN Cold on the shore in the raw cold of that leaden crisis in the four and twenty hours when the vital force of all the noblest and prettiest things that live is at its lowest the three watchers looked each at the blank faces of the other two and all at the blank face of Riderhood in his boat
501_125127_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Gaffer s boat Gaffer in luck again and yet no Gaffer So spake Riderhood staring disconsolate 
none	none	As if with one accord they all turned their eyes towards the light of the fire shining through the window It was fainter and duller 
501_125127_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps fire like the higher animal and vegetable life it helps to sustain has its greatest tendency towards death when the night is dying and the day is not yet born 
none	none	If it was me that had the law of this here job in hand growled Riderhood with a threatening shake of his head blest if I wouldn t lay hold of HER at any rate Ay but it is not you said Eugene With something so suddenly fierce in him that the informer returned submissively Well well well t other governor I didn t say it was A man may speak And vermin may be silent said Eugene Hold your tongue you water rat 
501_125127_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Astonished by his friend s unusual heat Lightwood stared too and then said What can have become of this man 
501_125127_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t imagine 
none	none	Unless he dived overboard The informer wiped his brow ruefully as he said it sitting in his boat and always staring disconsolate Did you make his boat fast
501_125127_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 She s fast enough till the tide runs back 
none	none	I couldn t make her faster than she is Come aboard of mine and see for your own selves There was a little backwardness in complying for the freight looked too much for the boat but on Riderhood s protesting that he had had half a dozen dead and alive in her afore now and she was nothing deep in the water nor down in the stern even then to speak of they carefully took their places and trimmed the crazy thing 
501_125127_000012_000001	train-clean-360	While they were doing so Riderhood still sat staring disconsolate 
none	none	All right Give way said Lightwood Give way by George repeated Riderhood before shoving off If he s gone and made off any how Lawyer Lightwood it s enough to make me give way in a different manner But he always WAS a cheat con found him He always was a infernal cheat was Gaffer Nothing straightfor ard nothing on the square So mean so underhanded Never going through with a thing nor carrying it out like a man Hallo 
501_125127_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Steady cried Eugene he had recovered immediately on embarking as they bumped heavily against a pile and then in a lower voice reversed his late apostrophe by remarking I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend may be endowed with philanthropy enough not to turn bottom upward and extinguish us Steady steady 
501_125127_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Sit close Mortimer 
501_125127_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Here s the hail again 
none	none	See how it flies like a troop of wild cats at mister Riderhood s eyes 
501_125127_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed he had the full benefit of it and it so mauled him though he bent his head low and tried to present nothing but the mangy cap to it that he dropped under the lee of a tier of shipping and they lay there until it was over 
501_125127_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The squall had come up like a spiteful messenger before the morning there followed in its wake a ragged tear of light which ripped the dark clouds until they showed a great grey hole of day 
501_125127_000017_000000	train-clean-360	They were all shivering and everything about them seemed to be shivering the river itself craft rigging sails such early smoke as there yet was on the shore 
501_125127_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Black with wet and altered to the eye by white patches of hail and sleet the huddled buildings looked lower than usual as if they were cowering and had shrunk with the cold 
none	none	Very little life was to be seen on either bank windows and doors were shut and the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses looked said Eugene to Mortimer like inscriptions over the graves of dead businesses As they glided slowly on keeping under the shore and sneaking in and out among the shipping by back alleys of water in a pilfering way that seemed to be their boatman s normal manner of progression all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat as to threaten to crush it Not a ship s hull with its rusty iron links of cable run out of hawse holes long discoloured with the iron s rusty tears but seemed to be there with a fell intention Not a figure head but had the menacing look of bursting forward to run them down Not a sluice gate or a painted scale upon a post or wall showing the depth of water but seemed to hint like the dreadfully facetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma s cottage That s to drown YOU in my dears Not a lumbering black barge with its cracked and blistered side impending over them but seemed to suck at the river with a thirst for sucking them under 
501_125127_000018_000003	train-clean-360	And everything so vaunted the spoiling influences of water discoloured copper rotten wood honey combed stone green dank deposit that the after consequences of being crushed sucked under and drawn down looked as ugly to the imagination as the main event 
none	none	Some half hour of this work and Riderhood unshipped his sculls stood holding on to a barge and hand over hand long wise along the barge s side gradually worked his boat under her head into a secret little nook of scummy water And driven into that nook and wedged as he had described was Gaffer s boat that boat with the stain still in it bearing some resemblance to a muffled human form Now tell me I m a liar said the honest man
501_125127_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 With a morbid expectation murmured Eugene to Lightwood that somebody is always going to tell him the truth 
501_125127_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 This is Hexam s boat said mister Inspector I know her well 
501_125127_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Look at the broken scull 
none	none	Look at the t other scull gone NOW tell me I am a liar said the honest man 
501_125127_000024_000000	train-clean-360	mister Inspector stepped into the boat 
none	none	Eugene and Mortimer looked on And see now added Riderhood creeping aft and showing a stretched rope made fast there and towing overboard Didn t I tell you he was in luck again Haul in said mister Inspector Easy to say haul in answered Riderhood Not so easy done 
501_125127_000027_000001	train-clean-360	His luck s got fouled under the keels of the barges 
none	none	I tried to haul in last time but I couldn t See how taut the line is
501_125127_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I must have it up said mister Inspector I am going to take this boat ashore and his luck along with it 
none	none	Try easy now 
501_125127_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He tried easy now but the luck resisted wouldn t come 
501_125127_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I mean to have it and the boat too said mister Inspector playing the line 
501_125127_000031_000000	train-clean-360	But still the luck resisted wouldn t come 
501_125127_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Take care said Riderhood 
501_125127_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll disfigure 
none	none	Or pull asunder perhaps
501_125127_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not going to do either not even to your Grandmother said mister Inspector but I mean to have it 
none	none	Come he added at once persuasively and with authority to the hidden object in the water as he played the line again it s no good this sort of game you know 
501_125127_000033_000002	train-clean-360	You MUST come up I mean to have you 
none	none	There was so much virtue in this distinctly and decidedly meaning to have it that it yielded a little even while the line was played
501_125127_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you so quoth mister Inspector pulling off his outer coat and leaning well over the stern with a will 
none	none	Come It was an awful sort of fishing but it no more disconcerted mister Inspector than if he had been fishing in a punt on a summer evening by some soothing weir high up the peaceful river After certain minutes and a few directions to the rest to ease her a little for ard and now ease her a trifle aft and the like he said composedly All clear and the line and the boat came free together Accepting Lightwood s proffered hand to help him up he then put on his coat and said to Riderhood Hand me over those spare sculls of yours and I ll pull this in to the nearest stairs 
501_125127_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Go ahead you and keep out in pretty open water that I mayn t get fouled again 
501_125127_000038_000000	train-clean-360	His directions were obeyed and they pulled ashore directly two in one boat two in the other 
none	none	Now said mister Inspector again to Riderhood when they were all on the slushy stones you have had more practice in this than I have had and ought to be a better workman at it Undo the tow rope and we ll help you haul in Riderhood got into the boat accordingly It appeared as if he had scarcely had a moment s time to touch the rope or look over the stern when he came scrambling back as pale as the morning and gasped out
501_125127_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 By the Lord he s done me 
none	none	What do you mean they all demanded 
501_125127_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He pointed behind him at the boat and gasped to that degree that he dropped upon the stones to get his breath 
none	none	Gaffer s done me 
501_125127_000044_000001	train-clean-360	It s Gaffer 
501_125127_000045_000000	train-clean-360	They ran to the rope leaving him gasping there 
none	none	Soon the form of the bird of prey dead some hours lay stretched upon the shore with a new blast storming at it and clotting the wet hair with hail stones Father was that you calling me Father I thought I heard you call me twice before Words never to be answered those upon the earth side of the grave 
501_125127_000046_000004	train-clean-360	The wind sweeps jeeringly over Father whips him with the frayed ends of his dress and his jagged hair tries to turn him where he lies stark on his back and force his face towards the rising sun that he may be shamed the more 
none	none	A lull and the wind is secret and prying with him lifts and lets falls a rag hides palpitating under another rag runs nimbly through his hair and beard Then in a rush it cruelly taunts him Father was that you calling me 
501_125127_000046_000008	train-clean-360	Was it you the voiceless and the dead 
none	none	Was it you thus buffeted as you lie here in a heap Was it you thus baptized unto Death with these flying impurities now flung upon your face 
501_125127_000046_000011	train-clean-360	Why not speak Father 
501_125127_000046_000014	train-clean-360	speak Father 
none	none	Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here is your own shape Did you never see such a shape soaked into your boat Speak Father Speak to us the winds the only listeners left you 
501_125127_000053_000018	train-clean-360	Now see 
none	none	said mister Inspector after mature deliberation kneeling on one knee beside the body when they had stood looking down on the drowned man as he had many a time looked down on many another man the way of it was this Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms 
501_125127_000048_000000	train-clean-360	They had helped to release the rope and of course not 
501_125127_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 And you will have observed before and you will observe now that this knot which was drawn chock tight round his neck by the strain of his own arms is a slip knot holding it up for demonstration 
none	none	Plain enough
501_125127_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Likewise you will have observed how he had run the other end of this rope to his boat 
none	none	It had the curves and indentations in it still where it had been twined and bound Now see said mister Inspector see how it works round upon him 
501_125127_000053_000001	train-clean-360	It s a wild tempestuous evening when this man that was stooping to wipe some hailstones out of his hair with an end of his own drowned jacket there 
501_125127_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Now he s more like himself though he s badly bruised when this man that was rows out upon the river on his usual lay 
501_125127_000053_000003	train-clean-360	He carries with him this coil of rope 
none	none	He always carries with him this coil of rope It s as well known to me as he was himself Sometimes it lay in the bottom of his boat Sometimes he hung it loose round his neck He was a light dresser was this man you see lifting the loose neckerchief over his breast and taking the opportunity of wiping the dead lips with it and when it was wet or freezing or blew cold he would hang this coil of line round his neck 
501_125127_000053_000008	train-clean-360	Last evening he does this Worse for him 
501_125127_000053_000009	train-clean-360	He dodges about in his boat does this man till he gets chilled 
none	none	His hands taking up one of them which dropped like a leaden weight get numbed 
501_125127_000053_000011	train-clean-360	He sees some object that s in his way of business floating 
501_125127_000053_000012	train-clean-360	He makes ready to secure that object 
none	none	He unwinds the end of his coil that he wants to take some turns on in his boat and he takes turns enough on it to secure that it shan t run out 
501_125127_000053_000014	train-clean-360	He makes it too secure as it happens 
none	none	He is a little longer about this than usual his hands being numbed 
501_125127_000053_000016	train-clean-360	His object drifts up before he is quite ready for it 
none	none	He catches at it thinks he ll make sure of the contents of the pockets anyhow in case he should be parted from it bends right over the stern and in one of these heavy squalls or in the cross swell of two steamers or in not being quite prepared or through all or most or some gets a lurch overbalances and goes head foremost overboard Now see He can swim can this man and instantly he strikes out But in such striking out he tangles his arms pulls strong on the slip knot and it runs home The object he had expected to take in tow floats by and his own boat tows him dead to where we found him all entangled in his own line 
501_125127_000053_000022	train-clean-360	You ll ask me how I make out about the pockets 
none	none	First I ll tell you more there was silver in em 
501_125127_000053_000024	train-clean-360	How do I make that out Simple and satisfactory 
501_125127_000053_000025	train-clean-360	Because he s got it here The lecturer held up the tightly clenched right hand 
501_125127_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 What is to be done with the remains asked Lightwood 
501_125127_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 If you wouldn t object to standing by him half a minute sir was the reply I ll find the nearest of our men to come and take charge of him I still call it HIM you see said mister Inspector looking back as he went with a philosophical smile upon the force of habit 
none	none	Eugene said Lightwood and was about to add we may wait at a little distance when turning his head he found that no Eugene was there 
501_125127_000057_000000	train-clean-360	He raised his voice and called Eugene 
none	none	Holloa But no Eugene replied 
501_125127_000058_000000	train-clean-360	It was broad daylight now and he looked about 
none	none	But no Eugene was in all the view mister Inspector speedily returning down the wooden stairs with a police constable Lightwood asked him if he had seen his friend leave them 
501_125127_000059_000001	train-clean-360	mister Inspector could not exactly say that he had seen him go but had noticed that he was restless 
501_125127_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Singular and entertaining combination sir your friend 
none	none	I wish it had not been a part of his singular entertaining combination to give me the slip under these dreary circumstances at this time of the morning said Lightwood Can we get anything hot to drink 
501_125127_000062_000000	train-clean-360	We could and we did 
501_125127_000062_000001	train-clean-360	In a public house kitchen with a large fire 
none	none	We got hot brandy and water and it revived us wonderfully 
501_125127_000062_000003	train-clean-360	mister Inspector having to mister Riderhood announced his official intention of keeping his eye upon him stood him in a corner of the fireplace like a wet umbrella and took no further outward and visible notice of that honest man except ordering a separate service of brandy and water for him apparently out of the public funds 
none	none	As Mortimer Lightwood sat before the blazing fire conscious of drinking brandy and water then and there in his sleep and yet at one and the same time drinking burnt sherry at the Six Jolly Fellowships and lying under the boat on the river shore and sitting in the boat that Riderhood rowed and listening to the lecture recently concluded and having to dine in the Temple with an unknown man who described himself as M H F Eugene Gaffer Harmon and said he lived at Hailstorm as he passed through these curious vicissitudes of fatigue and slumber arranged upon the scale of a dozen hours to the second he became aware of answering aloud a communication of pressing importance that had never been made to him and then turned it into a cough on beholding mister Inspector For he felt with some natural indignation that that functionary might otherwise suspect him of having closed his eyes or wandered in his attention
501_125127_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Here just before us you see said mister Inspector 
none	none	I see said Lightwood with dignity
501_125127_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 And had hot brandy and water too you see said mister Inspector and then cut off at a great rate 
none	none	Who said Lightwood Your friend you know I know he replied again with dignity After hearing in a mist through which mister Inspector loomed vague and large that the officer took upon himself to prepare the dead man s daughter for what had befallen in the night and generally that he took everything upon himself Mortimer Lightwood stumbled in his sleep to a cab stand called a cab and had entered the army and committed a capital military offence and been tried by court martial and found guilty and had arranged his affairs and been marched out to be shot before the door banged Hard work rowing the cab through the City to the Temple for a cup of from five to ten thousand pounds value given by mister Boffin and hard work holding forth at that immeasurable length to Eugene when he had been rescued with a rope from the running pavement for making off in that extraordinary manner 
501_125127_000071_000001	train-clean-360	But he offered such ample apologies and was so very penitent that when Lightwood got out of the cab he gave the driver a particular charge to be careful of him 
none	none	Which the driver knowing there was no other fare left inside stared at prodigiously 
501_125127_000072_000000	train-clean-360	In short the night s work had so exhausted and worn out this actor in it that he had become a mere somnambulist 
none	none	He was too tired to rest in his sleep until he was even tired out of being too tired and dropped into oblivion Late in the afternoon he awoke and in some anxiety sent round to Eugene s lodging hard by to inquire if he were up yet Oh yes he was up In fact he had not been to bed 
501_125127_000073_000002	train-clean-360	He had just come home 
none	none	And here he was close following on the heels of the message
501_125127_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Why what bloodshot draggled dishevelled spectacle is this cried Mortimer 
none	none	Are my feathers so very much rumpled said Eugene coolly going up to the looking glass They ARE rather out of sorts 
501_125127_000075_000002	train-clean-360	But consider 
501_125127_000075_000003	train-clean-360	Such a night for plumage 
none	none	Such a night repeated Mortimer What became of you in the morning My dear fellow said Eugene sitting on his bed I felt that we had bored one another so long that an unbroken continuance of those relations must inevitably terminate in our flying to opposite points of the earth 
501_125127_000077_000001	train-clean-360	I also felt that I had committed every crime in the Newgate Calendar 
none	none	So for mingled considerations of friendship and felony I took a walk Chapter fifteen TWO NEW SERVANTS mister and missus Boffin sat after breakfast in the Bower a prey to prosperity 
501_125128_000002_000001	train-clean-360	mister Boffin s face denoted Care and Complication 
none	none	Many disordered papers were before him and he looked at them about as hopefully as an innocent civilian might look at a crowd of troops whom he was required at five minutes notice to manoeuvre and review He had been engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers but being troubled as men of his stamp often are with an exceedingly distrustful and corrective thumb that busy member had so often interposed to smear his notes that they were little more legible than the various impressions of itself which blurred his nose and forehead 
501_125128_000002_000004	train-clean-360	It is curious to consider in such a case as mister Boffin s what a cheap article ink is and how far it may be made to go 
none	none	As a grain of musk will scent a drawer for many years and still lose nothing appreciable of its original weight so a halfpenny worth of ink would blot mister Boffin to the roots of his hair and the calves of his legs without inscribing a line on the paper before him or appearing to diminish in the inkstand mister Boffin was in such severe literary difficulties that his eyes were prominent and fixed and his breathing was stertorous when to the great relief of missus Boffin who observed these symptoms with alarm the yard bell rang Who s that I wonder said missus Boffin 
501_125128_000005_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin drew a long breath laid down his pen looked at his notes as doubting whether he had the pleasure of their acquaintance and appeared on a second perusal of their countenances to be confirmed in his impression that he had not when there was announced by the hammer headed young man 
none	none	mister Rokesmith
501_125128_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said mister Boffin Oh indeed 
none	none	Our and the Wilfers Mutual Friend my dear Yes 
501_125128_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Ask him to come in 
501_125128_000008_000000	train-clean-360	mister Rokesmith appeared 
none	none	Sit down sir said mister Boffin shaking hands with him
501_125128_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 missus Boffin you re already acquainted with 
501_125128_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Well sir I am rather unprepared to see you for to tell you the truth I ve been so busy with one thing and another that I ve not had time to turn your offer over 
501_125128_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 That s apology for both of us for mister Boffin and for me as well said the smiling missus Boffin But Lor we can talk it over now can t us 
none	none	mister Rokesmith bowed thanked her and said he hoped so Let me see then resumed mister Boffin with his hand to his chin
501_125128_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 It was Secretary that you named wasn t it 
501_125128_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I said Secretary assented mister Rokesmith 
501_125128_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 It rather puzzled me at the time said mister Boffin and it rather puzzled me and missus Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards because not to make a mystery of our belief we have always believed a Secretary to be a piece of furniture mostly of mahogany lined with green baize or leather with a lot of little drawers in it 
none	none	Now you won t think I take a liberty when I mention that you certainly ain t THAT 
501_125128_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Certainly not said mister Rokesmith 
501_125128_000015_000001	train-clean-360	But he had used the word in the sense of Steward 
501_125128_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Why as to Steward you see returned mister Boffin with his hand still to his chin the odds are that missus Boffin and me may never go upon the water 
501_125128_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Being both bad sailors we should want a Steward if we did but there s generally one provided 
501_125128_000017_000000	train-clean-360	mister Rokesmith again explained defining the duties he sought to undertake as those of general superintendent or manager or overlooker or man of business 
501_125128_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Now for instance come said mister Boffin in his pouncing way 
none	none	If you entered my employment what would you do
501_125128_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I would keep exact accounts of all the expenditure you sanctioned mister Boffin 
501_125128_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I would write your letters under your direction 
501_125128_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment 
none	none	I would with a glance and a half smile at the table arrange your papers mister Boffin rubbed his inky ear and looked at his wife And so arrange them as to have them always in order for immediate reference with a note of the contents of each outside it I tell you what said mister Boffin slowly crumpling his own blotted note in his hand if you ll turn to at these present papers and see what you can make of em I shall know better what I can make of you No sooner said than done Relinquishing his hat and gloves mister Rokesmith sat down quietly at the table arranged the open papers into an orderly heap cast his eyes over each in succession folded it docketed it on the outside laid it in a second heap and when that second heap was complete and the first gone took from his pocket a piece of string and tied it together with a remarkably dexterous hand at a running curve and a loop Good said mister Boffin Very good 
501_125128_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Now let us hear what they re all about will you be so good 
501_125128_000025_000000	train-clean-360	John Rokesmith read his abstracts aloud 
501_125128_000025_000001	train-clean-360	They were all about the new house 
501_125128_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Decorator s estimate so much 
501_125128_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Furniture estimate so much Estimate for furniture of offices so much 
501_125128_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Coach maker s estimate so much 
501_125128_000025_000005	train-clean-360	Horse dealer s estimate so much 
501_125128_000025_000006	train-clean-360	Harness maker s estimate so much 
none	none	Goldsmith s estimate so much Total so very much 
501_125128_000025_000009	train-clean-360	Then came correspondence 
501_125128_000025_000010	train-clean-360	Acceptance of mister Boffin s offer of such a date and to such an effect 
501_125128_000025_000011	train-clean-360	Rejection of mister Boffin s proposal of such a date and to such an effect 
501_125128_000025_000012	train-clean-360	Concerning mister Boffin s scheme of such another date to such another effect 
501_125128_000025_000013	train-clean-360	All compact and methodical 
501_125128_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Apple pie order said mister Boffin after checking off each inscription with his hand like a man beating time 
none	none	And whatever you do with your ink I can t think for you re as clean as a whistle after it 
501_125128_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Now as to a letter 
none	none	Let s said mister Boffin rubbing his hands in his pleasantly childish admiration let s try a letter next To whom shall it be addressed mister Boffin Anyone Yourself 
501_125128_000029_000000	train-clean-360	mister Rokesmith quickly wrote and then read aloud 
501_125128_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Boffin presents his compliments to mister John Rokesmith and begs to say that he has decided on giving mister John Rokesmith a trial in the capacity he desires to fill 
501_125128_000030_000001	train-clean-360	mister Boffin takes mister John Rokesmith at his word in postponing to some indefinite period the consideration of salary 
501_125128_000030_000002	train-clean-360	It is quite understood that mister Boffin is in no way committed on that point 
none	none	mister Boffin has merely to add that he relies on mister John Rokesmith s assurance that he will be faithful and serviceable 
501_125128_000030_000004	train-clean-360	mister John Rokesmith will please enter on his duties immediately 
none	none	Well 
501_125128_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Now Noddy cried missus Boffin clapping her hands That IS a good one 
501_125128_000032_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin was no less delighted indeed in his own bosom he regarded both the composition itself and the device that had given birth to it as a very remarkable monument of human ingenuity 
501_125128_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 And I tell you my deary said missus Boffin that if you don t close with mister Rokesmith now at once and if you ever go a muddling yourself again with things never meant nor made for you you ll have an apoplexy besides iron moulding your linen and you ll break my heart 
none	none	mister Boffin embraced his spouse for these words of wisdom and then congratulating John Rokesmith on the brilliancy of his achievements gave him his hand in pledge of their new relations 
501_125128_000034_000001	train-clean-360	So did missus Boffin 
none	none	Now said mister Boffin who in his frankness felt that it did not become him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes without reposing some confidence in him you must be let a little more into our affairs Rokesmith I mentioned to you when I made your acquaintance or I might better say when you made mine that missus Boffin s inclinations was setting in the way of Fashion but that I didn t know how fashionable we might or might not grow Well 
501_125128_000035_000003	train-clean-360	missus Boffin has carried the day and we re going in neck and crop for Fashion 
501_125128_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I rather inferred that sir replied John Rokesmith from the scale on which your new establishment is to be maintained 
501_125128_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said mister Boffin it s to be a Spanker 
501_125128_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The fact is my literary man named to me that a house with which he is as I may say connected in which he has an interest 
501_125128_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 As property inquired John Rokesmith 
none	none	Why no said mister Boffin not exactly that a sort of a family tie
501_125128_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Association the Secretary suggested 
none	none	Ah said mister Boffin Perhaps Anyhow he named to me that the house had a board up This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold Me and missus Boffin went to look at it and finding it beyond a doubt Eminently Aristocratic though a trifle high and dull which after all may be part of the same thing took it 
501_125128_000041_000002	train-clean-360	My literary man was so friendly as to drop into a charming piece of poetry on that occasion in which he complimented missus Boffin on coming into possession of how did it go my dear 
501_125128_000042_000000	train-clean-360	missus Boffin replied 
501_125128_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 The gay the gay and festive scene The halls the halls of dazzling light 
none	none	That s it And it was made neater by there really being two halls in the house a front un and a back un besides the servants He likewise dropped into a very pretty piece of poetry to be sure respecting the extent to which he would be willing to put himself out of the way to bring missus Boffin round in case she should ever get low in her spirits in the house 
501_125128_000044_000002	train-clean-360	missus Boffin has a wonderful memory 
501_125128_000044_000003	train-clean-360	Will you repeat it my dear 
none	none	missus Boffin complied by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer had been made exactly as she had received them I ll tell thee how the maiden wept missus Boffin When her true love was slain ma am And how her broken spirit slept missus Boffin And never woke again ma am I ll tell thee if agreeable to mister Boffin how the steed drew nigh And left his lord afar And if my tale which I hope mister Boffin might excuse should make you sigh I ll strike the light guitar
501_125128_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Correct to the letter said mister Boffin And I consider that the poetry brings us both in in a beautiful manner 
none	none	The effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish him mister Boffin was confirmed in his high opinion of it and was greatly pleased Now you see Rokesmith he went on a literary man WITH a wooden leg is liable to jealousy 
501_125128_000049_000001	train-clean-360	I shall therefore cast about for comfortable ways and means of not calling up Wegg s jealousy but of keeping you in your department and keeping him in his 
501_125128_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Lor cried missus Boffin What I say is the world s wide enough for all of us 
501_125128_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 So it is my dear said mister Boffin when not literary 
none	none	But when so not so 
501_125128_000051_000002	train-clean-360	And I am bound to bear in mind that I took Wegg on at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower 
none	none	To let him feel himself anyways slighted now would be to be guilty of a meanness and to act like having one s head turned by the halls of dazzling light Which Lord forbid Rokesmith what shall we say about your living in the house
501_125128_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 In this house 
501_125128_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No no I have got other plans for this house 
none	none	In the new house
501_125128_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 That will be as you please mister Boffin 
501_125128_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I hold myself quite at your disposal 
none	none	You know where I live at present Well said mister Boffin after considering the point suppose you keep as you are for the present and we ll decide by and by 
501_125128_000055_000001	train-clean-360	You ll begin to take charge at once of all that s going on in the new house will you 
none	none	Most willingly 
501_125128_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I will begin this very day 
none	none	Will you give me the address 
501_125128_000057_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin repeated it and the Secretary wrote it down in his pocket book 
501_125128_000057_000001	train-clean-360	missus Boffin took the opportunity of his being so engaged to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken 
501_125128_000057_000002	train-clean-360	It impressed her in his favour for she nodded aside to mister Boffin I like him 
none	none	I will see directly that everything is in train mister Boffin Thank ee 
501_125128_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Being here would you care at all to look round the Bower 
501_125128_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I should greatly like it 
none	none	I have heard so much of its story Come said mister Boffin And he and missus Boffin led the way A gloomy house the Bower with sordid signs on it of having been through its long existence as Harmony Jail in miserly holding 
501_125128_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Bare of paint bare of paper on the walls bare of furniture bare of experience of human life 
501_125128_000062_000002	train-clean-360	Whatever is built by man for man s occupation must like natural creations fulfil the intention of its existence or soon perish 
501_125128_000062_000003	train-clean-360	This old house had wasted more from desuetude than it would have wasted from use twenty years for one 
none	none	A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life as if they were nourished upon it which was very noticeable here The staircase balustrades and rails had a spare look an air of being denuded to the bone which the panels of the walls and the jambs of the doors and windows also bore 
501_125128_000063_000001	train-clean-360	The scanty moveables partook of it save for the cleanliness of the place the dust into which they were all resolving would have lain thick on the floors and those both in colour and in grain were worn like old faces that had kept much alone 
none	none	The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life was left as he had left it 
501_125128_000064_000001	train-clean-360	There was the old grisly four post bedstead without hangings and with a jail like upper rim of iron and spikes and there was the old patch work counterpane 
501_125128_000064_000002	train-clean-360	There was the tight clenched old bureau receding atop like a bad and secret forehead there was the cumbersome old table with twisted legs at the bed side and there was the box upon it in which the will had lain 
501_125128_000064_000003	train-clean-360	A few old chairs with patch work covers under which the more precious stuff to be preserved had slowly lost its quality of colour without imparting pleasure to any eye stood against the wall 
none	none	A hard family likeness was on all these things
501_125128_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 The room was kept like this Rokesmith said mister Boffin against the son s return 
501_125128_000065_000001	train-clean-360	In short everything in the house was kept exactly as it came to us for him to see and approve 
none	none	Even now nothing is changed but our own room below stairs that you have just left 
501_125128_000065_000003	train-clean-360	When the son came home for the last time in his life and for the last time in his life saw his father it was most likely in this room that they met 
501_125128_000066_000000	train-clean-360	As the Secretary looked all round it his eyes rested on a side door in a corner 
none	none	Another staircase said mister Boffin unlocking the door leading down into the yard 
501_125128_000067_000001	train-clean-360	We ll go down this way as you may like to see the yard and it s all in the road 
none	none	When the son was a little child it was up and down these stairs that he mostly came and went to his father 
501_125128_000067_000003	train-clean-360	He was very timid of his father 
501_125128_000067_000004	train-clean-360	I ve seen him sit on these stairs in his shy way poor child many a time 
501_125128_000067_000005	train-clean-360	mister and missus Boffin have comforted him sitting with his little book on these stairs often 
none	none	Ah 
501_125128_000068_000001	train-clean-360	And his poor sister too said missus Boffin And here s the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another 
none	none	Their own little hands wrote up their names here only with a pencil but the names are here still and the poor dears gone for ever
501_125128_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 We must take care of the names old lady said mister Boffin We must take care of the names 
501_125128_000069_000001	train-clean-360	They shan t be rubbed out in our time nor yet if we can help it in the time after us 
none	none	Poor little children Ah poor little children said missus Boffin 
501_125128_000071_000000	train-clean-360	They had opened the door at the bottom of the staircase giving on the yard and they stood in the sunlight looking at the scrawl of the two unsteady childish hands two or three steps up the staircase 
none	none	There was something in this simple memento of a blighted childhood and in the tenderness of missus Boffin that touched the Secretary mister Boffin then showed his new man of business the Mounds and his own particular Mound which had been left him as his legacy under the will before he acquired the whole estate
501_125128_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 It would have been enough for us said mister Boffin in case it had pleased God to spare the last of those two young lives and sorrowful deaths 
501_125128_000073_000001	train-clean-360	We didn t want the rest 
none	none	At the treasures of the yard and at the outside of the house and at the detached building which mister Boffin pointed out as the residence of himself and his wife during the many years of their service the Secretary looked with interest It was not until mister Boffin had shown him every wonder of the Bower twice over that he remembered his having duties to discharge elsewhere You have no instructions to give me mister Boffin in reference to this place
501_125128_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Not any Rokesmith 
none	none	No
501_125128_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Might I ask without seeming impertinent whether you have any intention of selling it 
none	none	Certainly not 
501_125128_000078_000001	train-clean-360	In remembrance of our old master our old master s children and our old service me and missus Boffin mean to keep it up as it stands 
501_125128_000079_000000	train-clean-360	The Secretary s eyes glanced with so much meaning in them at the Mounds that mister Boffin said as if in answer to a remark 
none	none	Ay ay that s another thing I may sell THEM though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of em too It ll look but a poor dead flat without the Mounds Still I don t say that I m going to keep em always there for the sake of the beauty of the landscape 
501_125128_000080_000004	train-clean-360	There s no hurry about it that s all I say at present 
501_125128_000080_000005	train-clean-360	I ain t a scholar in much Rokesmith but I m a pretty fair scholar in dust 
501_125128_000080_000006	train-clean-360	I can price the Mounds to a fraction and I know how they can be best disposed of and likewise that they take no harm by standing where they do 
501_125128_000080_000007	train-clean-360	You ll look in to morrow will you be so kind 
none	none	Every day 
501_125128_000081_000001	train-clean-360	And the sooner I can get you into your new house complete the better you will be pleased sir 
501_125128_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it ain t that I m in a mortal hurry said mister Boffin only when you DO pay people for looking alive it s as well to know that they ARE looking alive 
501_125128_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Ain t that your opinion 
none	none	Quite replied the Secretary and so withdrew Now said mister Boffin to himself subsiding into his regular series of turns in the yard if I can make it comfortable with Wegg my affairs will be going smooth 
501_125128_000085_000000	train-clean-360	The man of low cunning had of course acquired a mastery over the man of high simplicity 
none	none	The mean man had of course got the better of the generous man 
501_125128_000085_000002	train-clean-360	How long such conquests last is another matter that they are achieved is every day experience not even to be flourished away by Podsnappery itself 
none	none	The undesigning Boffin had become so far immeshed by the wily Wegg that his mind misgave him he was a very designing man indeed in purposing to do more for Wegg 
501_125128_000085_000004	train-clean-360	It seemed to him so skilful was Wegg that he was plotting darkly when he was contriving to do the very thing that Wegg was plotting to get him to do 
none	none	And thus while he was mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning he was not absolutely sure but that he might somehow deserve the charge of turning his back on him 
501_125128_000086_000000	train-clean-360	For these reasons mister Boffin passed but anxious hours until evening came and with it mister Wegg stumping leisurely to the Roman Empire 
501_125128_000086_000001	train-clean-360	At about this period mister Boffin had become profoundly interested in the fortunes of a great military leader known to him as Bully Sawyers but perhaps better known to fame and easier of identification by the classical student under the less Britannic name of Belisarius 
none	none	Even this general s career paled in interest for mister Boffin before the clearing of his conscience with Wegg and hence when that literary gentleman had according to custom eaten and drunk until he was all a glow and when he took up his book with the usual chirping introduction And now mister Boffin sir we ll decline and we ll fall mister Boffin stopped him You remember Wegg when I first told you that I wanted to make a sort of offer to you
501_125128_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me get on my considering cap sir replied that gentleman turning the open book face downward 
none	none	When you first told me that you wanted to make a sort of offer to me 
501_125128_000088_000002	train-clean-360	Now let me think as if there were the least necessity Yes to be sure I do mister Boffin 
501_125128_000088_000003	train-clean-360	It was at my corner To be sure it was 
501_125128_000088_000004	train-clean-360	You had first asked me whether I liked your name and Candour had compelled a reply in the negative case 
501_125128_000088_000005	train-clean-360	I little thought then sir how familiar that name would come to be 
none	none	I hope it will be more familiar still Wegg Do you mister Boffin 
501_125128_000090_000001	train-clean-360	Much obliged to you I m sure 
501_125128_000090_000002	train-clean-360	Is it your pleasure sir that we decline and we fall with a feint of taking up the book 
none	none	Not just yet awhile Wegg 
501_125128_000091_000001	train-clean-360	In fact I have got another offer to make you 
501_125128_000092_000000	train-clean-360	mister Wegg who had had nothing else in his mind for several nights took off his spectacles with an air of bland surprise 
501_125128_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 And I hope you ll like it Wegg 
501_125128_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you sir returned that reticent individual 
501_125128_000094_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope it may prove so 
501_125128_000094_000002	train-clean-360	On all accounts I am sure This as a philanthropic aspiration 
501_125128_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think said mister Boffin of not keeping a stall Wegg 
501_125128_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 I think sir replied Wegg that I should like to be shown the gentleman prepared to make it worth my while 
none	none	Here he is said mister Boffin 
501_125128_000098_000000	train-clean-360	mister Wegg was going to say My Benefactor and had said My Bene when a grandiloquent change came over him 
501_125128_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 No mister Boffin not you sir 
501_125128_000099_000001	train-clean-360	Anybody but you 
501_125128_000099_000002	train-clean-360	Do not fear mister Boffin that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought with MY lowly pursuits 
none	none	I am aware sir that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion 
501_125128_000099_000004	train-clean-360	I have already thought of that and taken my measures 
501_125128_000099_000005	train-clean-360	No need to be bought out sir Would Stepney Fields be considered intrusive 
501_125128_000099_000006	train-clean-360	If not remote enough I can go remoter 
501_125128_000099_000007	train-clean-360	In the words of the poet s song which I do not quite remember 
none	none	Thrown on the wide world doom d to wander and roam Bereft of my parents bereft of a home A stranger to something and what s his name joy Behold little Edmund the poor Peasant boy
501_125128_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 And equally said mister Wegg repairing the want of direct application in the last line behold myself on a similar footing 
501_125128_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Wegg Wegg Wegg remonstrated the excellent Boffin 
none	none	You are too sensitive
501_125128_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 I know I am sir returned Wegg with obstinate magnanimity 
501_125128_000103_000001	train-clean-360	 I am acquainted with my faults 
501_125128_000105_000001	train-clean-360	 I am acquainted with my faults 
501_125128_000103_000002	train-clean-360	I always was from a child too sensitive 
501_125128_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 But listen pursued the Golden Dustman hear me out Wegg 
501_125128_000104_000001	train-clean-360	You have taken it into your head that I mean to pension you off 
none	none	True sir returned Wegg still with an obstinate magnanimity I am acquainted with my faults 
501_125128_000105_000002	train-clean-360	Far be it from me to deny them 
501_125128_000105_000003	train-clean-360	I HAVE taken it into my head 
none	none	But I DON T mean it The assurance seemed hardly as comforting to mister Wegg as mister Boffin intended it to be Indeed an appreciable elongation of his visage might have been observed as he replied
501_125128_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you indeed sir 
501_125128_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 No pursued mister Boffin because that would express as I understand it that you were not going to do anything to deserve your money 
501_125128_000109_000001	train-clean-360	But you are you are 
none	none	That sir replied mister Wegg cheering up bravely is quite another pair of shoes 
501_125128_000110_000001	train-clean-360	Now my independence as a man is again elevated 
501_125128_000110_000002	train-clean-360	Now I no longer
501_125128_000111_000000	train-clean-360	Weep for the hour When to Boffinses bower The Lord of the valley with offers came Neither does the moon hide her light From the heavens to night And weep behind her clouds o er any individual in the present Company s shame 
none	none	Please to proceed mister Boffin Thank ee Wegg both for your confidence in me and for your frequent dropping into poetry both of which is friendly Well then my idea is that you should give up your stall and that I should put you into the Bower here to keep it for us It s a pleasant spot and a man with coals and candles and a pound a week might be in clover here Hem 
501_125128_000114_000001	train-clean-360	Would that man sir we will say that man for the purposes of argueyment mister Wegg made a smiling demonstration of great perspicuity here would that man sir be expected to throw any other capacity in or would any other capacity be considered extra 
501_125128_000114_000002	train-clean-360	Now let us for the purposes of argueyment suppose that man to be engaged as a reader say for the purposes of argueyment in the evening 
none	none	Would that man s pay as a reader in the evening be added to the other amount which adopting your language we will call clover or would it merge into that amount or clover
501_125128_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said mister Boffin I suppose it would be added 
501_125128_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose it would sir 
none	none	You are right sir 
501_125128_000116_000002	train-clean-360	Exactly my own views mister Boffin Here Wegg rose and balancing himself on his wooden leg fluttered over his prey with extended hand 
501_125128_000116_000003	train-clean-360	 mister Boffin consider it done 
none	none	Say no more sir not a word more 
501_125128_000116_000005	train-clean-360	My stall and I are for ever parted 
501_125128_000116_000006	train-clean-360	The collection of ballads will in future be reserved for private study with the object of making poetry tributary Wegg was so proud of having found this word that he said it again with a capital letter Tributary to friendship 
501_125128_000116_000007	train-clean-360	mister Boffin don t allow yourself to be made uncomfortable by the pang it gives me to part from my stock and stall 
none	none	Similar emotion was undergone by my own father when promoted for his merits from his occupation as a waterman to a situation under Government 
501_125128_000116_000009	train-clean-360	His Christian name was Thomas 
501_125128_000116_000010	train-clean-360	His words at the time I was then an infant but so deep was their impression on me that I committed them to memory were 
none	none	Then farewell my trim built wherry Oars and coat and badge farewell Never more at Chelsea Ferry Shall your Thomas take a spell
501_125128_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 My father got over it mister Boffin and so shall I 
none	none	While delivering these valedictory observations Wegg continually disappointed mister Boffin of his hand by flourishing it in the air 
501_125128_000119_000001	train-clean-360	He now darted it at his patron who took it and felt his mind relieved of a great weight observing that as they had arranged their joint affairs so satisfactorily he would now be glad to look into those of Bully Sawyers 
none	none	Which indeed had been left over night in a very unpromising posture and for whose impending expedition against the Persians the weather had been by no means favourable all day 
501_125128_000120_000000	train-clean-360	mister Wegg resumed his spectacles therefore 
none	none	But Sawyers was not to be of the party that night for before Wegg had found his place missus Boffin s tread was heard upon the stairs so unusually heavy and hurried that mister Boffin would have started up at the sound anticipating some occurrence much out of the common course even though she had not also called to him in an agitated tone 
501_125128_000121_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin hurried out and found her on the dark staircase panting with a lighted candle in her hand 
none	none	What s the matter my dear I don t know I don t know but I wish you d come up stairs Much surprised mister Boffin went up stairs and accompanied missus Boffin into their own room a second large room on the same floor as the room in which the late proprietor had died mister Boffin looked all round him and saw nothing more unusual than various articles of folded linen on a large chest which missus Boffin had been sorting
501_125128_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it my dear 
none	none	Why you re frightened YOU frightened I am not one of that sort certainly said missus Boffin as she sat down in a chair to recover herself and took her husband s arm but it s very strange
501_125128_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 What is my dear 
none	none	Noddy the faces of the old man and the two children are all over the house to night My dear exclaimed mister Boffin But not without a certain uncomfortable sensation gliding down his back
501_125128_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 I know it must sound foolish and yet it is so 
none	none	Where did you think you saw them
501_125128_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know that I think I saw them anywhere 
501_125128_000132_000001	train-clean-360	I felt them 
501_125128_000133_000000	train-clean-360	 Touched them 
none	none	No Felt them in the air I was sorting those things on the chest and not thinking of the old man or the children but singing to myself when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark
501_125128_000135_000000	train-clean-360	 What face asked her husband looking about him 
501_125128_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 For a moment it was the old man s and then it got younger 
501_125128_000136_000001	train-clean-360	For a moment it was both the children s and then it got older 
none	none	For a moment it was a strange face and then it was all the faces
501_125128_000137_000000	train-clean-360	 And then it was gone 
501_125128_000138_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and then it was gone 
501_125128_000139_000000	train-clean-360	 Where were you then old lady 
501_125128_000140_000000	train-clean-360	 Here at the chest 
501_125128_000140_000001	train-clean-360	Well I got the better of it and went on sorting and went on singing to myself 
501_125128_000140_000002	train-clean-360	 Lor I says I ll think of something else something comfortable and put it out of my head So I thought of the new house and Miss Bella Wilfer and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand when all of a sudden the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop 
none	none	As it still lay on the floor where it had fallen mister Boffin picked it up and laid it on the chest And then you ran down stairs No 
501_125128_000143_000001	train-clean-360	I thought I d try another room and shake it off 
none	none	I says to myself I ll go and walk slowly up and down the old man s room three times from end to end and then I shall have conquered it I went in with the candle in my hand but the moment I came near the bed the air got thick with them
501_125128_000144_000000	train-clean-360	 With the faces 
501_125128_000145_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and I even felt that they were in the dark behind the side door and on the little staircase floating away into the yard 
none	none	Then I called you 
501_125128_000146_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin lost in amazement looked at missus Boffin 
501_125128_000146_000001	train-clean-360	missus Boffin lost in her own fluttered inability to make this out looked at mister Boffin 
none	none	I think my dear said the Golden Dustman I ll at once get rid of Wegg for the night because he s coming to inhabit the Bower and it might be put into his head or somebody else s if he heard this and it got about that the house is haunted 
501_125128_000147_000001	train-clean-360	Whereas we know better 
none	none	Don t we
501_125128_000148_000000	train-clean-360	 I never had the feeling in the house before said missus Boffin and I have been about it alone at all hours of the night 
none	none	I have been in the house when Death was in it and I have been in the house when Murder was a new part of its adventures and I never had a fright in it yet
501_125128_000149_000000	train-clean-360	 And won t again my dear said mister Boffin Depend upon it it comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot 
501_125128_000150_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but why didn t it come before asked missus Boffin 
501_125128_000151_000000	train-clean-360	This draft on mister Boffin s philosophy could only be met by that gentleman with the remark that everything that is at all must begin at some time Then tucking his wife s arm under his own that she might not be left by herself to be troubled again he descended to release Wegg 
501_125128_000151_000001	train-clean-360	Who being something drowsy after his plentiful repast and constitutionally of a shirking temperament was well enough pleased to stump away without doing what he had come to do and was paid for doing 
501_125128_000152_000000	train-clean-360	mister Boffin then put on his hat and missus Boffin her shawl and the pair further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern went all over the dismal house dismal everywhere but in their own two rooms from cellar to cock loft 
none	none	Not resting satisfied with giving that much chace to missus Boffin s fancies they pursued them into the yard and outbuildings and under the Mounds And setting the lantern when all was done at the foot of one of the Mounds they comfortably trotted to and fro for an evening walk to the end that the murky cobwebs in missus Boffin s brain might be blown away There my dear said mister Boffin when they came in to supper
501_125128_000153_000001	train-clean-360	 That was the treatment you see 
none	none	Completely worked round haven t you
501_125128_000154_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes deary said missus Boffin laying aside her shawl 
501_125128_000154_000001	train-clean-360	 I m not nervous any more 
none	none	I m not a bit troubled now I d go anywhere about the house the same as ever But Eh said mister Boffin But I ve only to shut my eyes And what then Why then said missus Boffin speaking with her eyes closed and her left hand thoughtfully touching her brow then there they are 
501_125128_000158_000001	train-clean-360	The old man s face and it gets younger 
501_125128_000158_000002	train-clean-360	The two children s faces and they get older 
501_125128_000158_000003	train-clean-360	A face that I don t know 
none	none	And then all the faces Opening her eyes again and seeing her husband s face across the table she leaned forward to give it a pat on the cheek and sat down to supper declaring it to be the best face in the world Chapter sixteen MINDERS AND RE MINDERS The Secretary lost no time in getting to work and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the Golden Dustman s affairs His earnestness in determining to understand the length and breadth and depth of every piece of work submitted to him by his employer was as special as his despatch in transacting it He accepted no information or explanation at second hand but made himself the master of everything confided to him One part of the Secretary s conduct underlying all the rest might have been mistrusted by a man with a better knowledge of men than the Golden Dustman had The Secretary was as far from being inquisitive or intrusive as Secretary could be but nothing less than a complete understanding of the whole of the affairs would content him It soon became apparent from the knowledge with which he set out that he must have been to the office where the Harmon will was registered and must have read the will He anticipated mister Boffin s consideration whether he should be advised with on this or that topic by showing that he already knew of it and understood it He did this with no attempt at concealment seeming to be satisfied that it was part of his duty to have prepared himself at all attainable points for its utmost discharge This might let it be repeated have awakened some little vague mistrust in a man more worldly wise than the Golden Dustman On the other hand the Secretary was discerning discreet and silent though as zealous as if the affairs had been his own He showed no love of patronage or the command of money but distinctly preferred resigning both to mister Boffin If in his limited sphere he sought power it was the power of knowledge the power derivable from a perfect comprehension of his business As on the Secretary s face there was a nameless cloud so on his manner there was a shadow equally indefinable It was not that he was embarrassed as on that first night with the Wilfer family he was habitually unembarrassed now and yet the something remained It was not that his manner was bad as on that occasion it was now very good as being modest gracious and ready Yet the something never left it It has been written of men who have undergone a cruel captivity or who have passed through a terrible strait or who in self preservation have killed a defenceless fellow creature that the record thereof has never faded from their countenances until they died Was there any such record here He established a temporary office for himself in the new house and all went well under his hand with one singular exception He manifestly objected to communicate with mister Boffin s solicitor Two or three times when there was some slight occasion for his doing so he transferred the task to mister Boffin and his evasion of it soon became so curiously apparent that mister Boffin spoke to him on the subject of his reluctance It is so the Secretary admitted I would rather not Had he any personal objection to mister Lightwood I don t know him Had he suffered from law suits Not more than other men was his short answer Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers No But while I am in your employment sir I would rather be excused from going between the lawyer and the client Of course if you press it mister Boffin I am ready to comply But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion Now it could not be said that there WAS urgent occasion for Lightwood retained no other affairs in his hands than such as still lingered and languished about the undiscovered criminal and such as arose out of the purchase of the house Many other matters that might have travelled to him now stopped short at the Secretary under whose administration they were far more expeditiously and satisfactorily disposed of than they would have been if they had got into Young Blight s domain This the Golden Dustman quite understood Even the matter immediately in hand was of very little moment as requiring personal appearance on the Secretary s part for it amounted to no more than this The death of Hexam rendering the sweat of the honest man s brow unprofitable the honest man had shufflingly declined to moisten his brow for nothing with that severe exertion which is known in legal circles as swearing your way through a stone wall Consequently that new light had gone sputtering out But the airing of the old facts had led some one concerned to suggest that it would be well before they were reconsigned to their gloomy shelf now probably for ever to induce or compel that mister Julius Handford to reappear and be questioned And all traces of mister Julius Handford being lost Lightwood now referred to his client for authority to seek him through public advertisement Does your objection go to writing to Lightwood Rokesmith Not in the least sir Then perhaps you ll write him a line and say he is free to do what he likes I don t think it promises I don t think it promises said the Secretary Still he may do what he likes I will write immediately Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination It may seem less unreasonable if I avow to you that although I don t know mister Lightwood I have a disagreeable association connected with him It is not his fault he is not at all to blame for it and does not even know my name mister Boffin dismissed the matter with a nod or two The letter was written and next day mister Julius Handford was advertised for He was requested to place himself in communication with mister Mortimer Lightwood as a possible means of furthering the ends of justice and a reward was offered to any one acquainted with his whereabout who would communicate the same to the said mister Mortimer Lightwood at his office in the Temple Every day for six weeks this advertisement appeared at the head of all the newspapers and every day for six weeks the Secretary when he saw it said to himself in the tone in which he had said to his employer I don t think it promises Among his first occupations the pursuit of that orphan wanted by missus Boffin held a conspicuous place From the earliest moment of his engagement he showed a particular desire to please her and knowing her to have this object at heart he followed it up with unwearying alacrity and interest mister and missus Milvey had found their search a difficult one Either an eligible orphan was of the wrong sex which almost always happened or was too old or too young or too sickly or too dirty or too much accustomed to the streets or too likely to run away or it was found impossible to complete the philanthropic transaction without buying the orphan For the instant it became known that anybody wanted the orphan up started some affectionate relative of the orphan who put a price upon the orphan s head The suddenness of an orphan s rise in the market was not to be paralleled by the maddest records of the Stock Exchange He would be at five thousand per cent discount out at nurse making a mud pie at nine in the morning and being inquired for would go up to five thousand per cent premium before noon The market was rigged in various artful ways Counterfeit stock got into circulation Parents boldly represented themselves as dead and brought their orphans with them Genuine orphan stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the market It being announced by emissaries posted for the purpose that mister and missus Milvey were coming down the court orphan scrip would be instantly concealed and production refused save on a condition usually stated by the brokers as a gallon of beer Likewise fluctuations of a wild and South Sea nature were occasioned by orphan holders keeping back and then rushing into the market a dozen together But the uniform principle at the root of all these various operations was bargain and sale and that principle could not be recognized by mister and missus Milvey At length tidings were received by the Reverend Frank of a charming orphan to be found at Brentford One of the deceased parents late his parishioners had a poor widowed grandmother in that agreeable town and she missus Betty Higden had carried off the orphan with maternal care but could not afford to keep him The Secretary proposed to missus Boffin either to go down himself and take a preliminary survey of this orphan or to drive her down that she might at once form her own opinion missus Boffin preferring the latter course they set off one morning in a hired phaeton conveying the hammer headed young man behind them The abode of missus Betty Higden was not easy to find lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their equipage at the sign of the Three Magpies and went in search of it on foot After many inquiries and defeats there was pointed out to them in a lane a very small cottage residence with a board across the open doorway hooked on to which board by the armpits was a young gentleman of tender years angling for mud with a headless wooden horse and line In this young sportsman distinguished by a crisply curling auburn head and a bluff countenance the Secretary descried the orphan It unfortunately happened as they quickened their pace that the orphan lost to considerations of personal safety in the ardour of the moment overbalanced himself and toppled into the street Being an orphan of a chubby conformation he then took to rolling and had rolled into the gutter before they could come up From the gutter he was rescued by John Rokesmith and thus the first meeting with missus Higden was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of their being in possession one would say at first sight unlawful possession of the orphan upside down and purple in the countenance The board across the doorway too acting as a trap equally for the feet of missus Higden coming out and the feet of missus Boffin and John Rokesmith going in greatly increased the difficulty of the situation to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character At first it was impossible to explain on account of the orphan s holding his breath a most terrific proceeding super inducing in the orphan lead colour rigidity and a deadly silence compared with which his cries were music yielding the height of enjoyment But as he gradually recovered missus Boffin gradually introduced herself and smiling peace was gradually wooed back to missus Betty Higden s home It was then perceived to be a small home with a large mangle in it at the handle of which machine stood a very long boy with a very little head and an open mouth of disproportionate capacity that seemed to assist his eyes in staring at the visitors In a corner below the mangle on a couple of stools sat two very little children a boy and a girl and when the very long boy in an interval of staring took a turn at the mangle it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents like a catapult designed for their destruction harmlessly retiring when within an inch of their heads The room was clean and neat It had a brick floor and a window of diamond panes and a flounce hanging below the chimney piece and strings nailed from bottom to top outside the window on which scarlet beans were to grow in the coming season if the Fates were propitious However propitious they might have been in the seasons that were gone to Betty Higden in the matter of beans they had not been very favourable in the matter of coins for it was easy to see that she was poor She was one of those old women was missus Betty Higden who by dint of an indomitable purpose and a strong constitution fight out many years though each year has come with its new knock down blows fresh to the fight against her wearied by it an active old woman with a bright dark eye and a resolute face yet quite a tender creature too not a logically reasoning woman but God is good and hearts may count in Heaven as high as heads Yes sure said she when the business was opened missus Milvey had the kindness to write to me ma am and I got
1027_125140_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Sloppy 
none	none	to read it It was a pretty letter But she s an affable lady The visitors glanced at the long boy who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him Sloppy stood confessed For I aint you must know said Betty much of a hand at reading writing hand though I can read my Bible and most print And I do love a newspaper You mightn t think it but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper He do the Police in different voices The visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at Sloppy who looking at them suddenly threw back his head extended his mouth to its utmost width and laughed loud and long At this the two innocents with their brains in that apparent danger laughed and missus Higden laughed and the orphan laughed and then the visitors laughed Which was more cheerful than intelligible Then Sloppy seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury turned to at the mangle and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling that missus Higden stopped him The gentlefolks can t hear themselves speak Sloppy Bide a bit bide a bit Is that the dear child in your lap said missus Boffin Yes ma am this is Johnny Johnny too cried missus Boffin turning to the Secretary already Johnny Only one of the two names left to give him He s a pretty boy With his chin tucked down in his shy childish manner he was looking furtively at missus Boffin out of his blue eyes and reaching his fat dimpled hand up to the lips of the old woman who was kissing it by times Yes ma am he s a pretty boy he s a dear darling boy he s the child of my own last left daughter s daughter But she s gone the way of all the rest Those are not his brother and sister said missus Boffin Oh dear no ma am Those are Minders Minders the Secretary repeated Left to be Minded sir I keep a Minding School I can take only three on account of the Mangle But I love children and Four pence a week is Four pence Come here Toddles and Poddles Toddles was the pet name of the boy Poddles of the girl At their little unsteady pace they came across the floor hand in hand as if they were traversing an extremely difficult road intersected by brooks and when they had had their heads patted by missus Betty Higden made lunges at the orphan dramatically representing an attempt to bear him crowing into captivity and slavery All the three children enjoyed this to a delightful extent and the sympathetic Sloppy again laughed long and loud When it was discreet to stop the play Betty Higden said Go to your seats Toddles and Poddles and they returned hand in hand across country seeming to find the brooks rather swollen by late rains And Master or Mister Sloppy said the Secretary in doubt whether he was man boy or what A love child returned Betty Higden dropping her voice parents never known found in the street He was brought up in the with a shiver of repugnance the House The Poor house said the Secretary missus Higden set that resolute old face of hers and darkly nodded yes You dislike the mention of it Dislike the mention of it answered the old woman Kill me sooner than take me there Throw this pretty child under cart horses feet and a loaded waggon sooner than take him there Come to us and find us all a dying and set a light to us all where we lie and let us all blaze away with the house into a heap of cinders sooner than move a corpse of us there A surprising spirit in this lonely woman after so many years of hard working and hard living my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards What is it that we call it in our grandiose speeches British independence rather perverted Is that or something like it the ring of the cant Do I never read in the newspapers said the dame fondling the child God help me and the like of me how the worn out people that do come down to that get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post a purpose to tire them out Do I never read how they are put off put off put off how they are grudged grudged grudged the shelter or the doctor or the drop of physic or the bit of bread Do I never read how they grow heartsick of it and give it up after having let themselves drop so low and how they after all die out for want of help Then I say I hope I can die as well as another and I ll die without that disgrace Absolutely impossible my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards by any stretch of legislative wisdom to set these perverse people right in their logic Johnny my pretty continued old Betty caressing the child and rather mourning over it than speaking to it your old Granny Betty is nigher fourscore year than threescore and ten She never begged nor had a penny of the Union money in all her life She paid scot and she paid lot when she had money to pay she worked when she could and she starved when she must You pray that your Granny may have strength enough left her at the last she s strong for an old one Johnny to get up from her bed and run and hide herself and swown to death in a hole sooner than fall into the hands of those Cruel Jacks we read of that dodge and drive and worry and weary and scorn and shame the decent poor A brilliant success my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards to have brought it to this in the minds of the best of the poor Under submission might it be worth thinking of at any odd time The fright and abhorrence that missus Betty Higden smoothed out of her strong face as she ended this diversion showed how seriously she had meant it And does he work for you asked the Secretary gently bringing the discourse back to Master or Mister Sloppy Yes said Betty with a good humoured smile and nod of the head And well too Does he live here He lives more here than anywhere He was thought to be no better than a Natural and first come to me as a Minder I made interest with mister Blogg the Beadle to have him as a Minder seeing him by chance up at church and thinking I might do something with him For he was a weak ricketty creetur then Is he called by his right name Why you see speaking quite correctly he has no right name I always understood he took his name from being found on a Sloppy night He seems an amiable fellow Bless you sir there s not a bit of him returned Betty that s not amiable So you may judge how amiable he is by running your eye along his heighth Of an ungainly make was Sloppy Too much of him longwise too little of him broadwise and too many sharp angles of him angle wise One of those shambling male human creatures born to be indiscreetly candid in the revelation of buttons every button he had about him glaring at the public to a quite preternatural extent A considerable capital of knee and elbow and wrist and ankle had Sloppy and he didn t know how to dispose of it to the best advantage but was always investing it in wrong securities and so getting himself into embarrassed circumstances Full Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of life was Sloppy and yet had his glimmering notions of standing true to the Colours And now said missus Boffin concerning Johnny As Johnny with his chin tucked in and lips pouting reclined in Betty s lap concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading them from observation with a dimpled arm old Betty took one of his fresh fat hands in her withered right and fell to gently beating it on her withered left Yes ma am Concerning Johnny If you trust the dear child to me said missus Boffin with a face inviting trust he shall have the best of homes the best of care the best of education the best of friends Please God I will be a true good mother to him I am thankful to you ma am and the dear child would be thankful if he was old enough to understand Still lightly beating the little hand upon her own I wouldn t stand in the dear child s light not if I had all my life before me instead of a very little of it But I hope you won t take it ill that I cleave to the child closer than words can tell for he s the last living thing left me Take it ill my dear soul Is it likely And you so tender of him as to bring him home here I have seen said Betty still with that light beat upon her hard rough hand so many of them on my lap And they are all gone but this one I am ashamed to seem so selfish but I don t really mean it It ll be the making of his fortune and he ll be a gentleman when I am dead I I don t know what comes over me I try against it Don t notice me The light beat stopped the resolute mouth gave way and the fine strong old face broke up into weakness and tears Now greatly to the relief of the visitors the emotional Sloppy no sooner beheld his patroness in this condition than throwing back his head and throwing open his mouth he lifted up his voice and bellowed This alarming note of something wrong instantly terrified Toddles and Poddles who were no sooner heard to roar surprisingly than Johnny curving himself the wrong way and striking out at missus Boffin with a pair of indifferent shoes became a prey to despair The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout missus Betty Higden was herself in a moment and brought them all to order with that speed that Sloppy stopping short in a polysyllabic bellow transferred his energy to the mangle and had taken several penitential turns before he could be stopped There there there said missus Boffin almost regarding her kind self as the most ruthless of women Nothing is going to be done Nobody need be frightened We re all comfortable ain t we missus Higden Sure and certain we are returned Betty And there really is no hurry you know said missus Boffin in a lower voice Take time to think of it my good creature Don t you fear ME no more ma am said Betty I thought of it for good yesterday I don t know what come over me just now but it ll never come again Well then Johnny shall have more time to think of it returned missus Boffin the pretty child shall have time to get used to it And you ll get him more used to it if you think well of it won t you Betty undertook that cheerfully and readily Lor cried missus Boffin looking radiantly about her we want to make everybody happy not dismal And perhaps you wouldn t mind letting me know how used to it you begin to get and how it all goes on I ll send Sloppy said missus Higden And this gentleman who has come with me will pay him for his trouble said missus Boffin And mister Sloppy whenever you come to my house be sure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat beer vegetables and pudding This still further brightened the face of affairs for the highly sympathetic Sloppy first broadly staring and grinning and then roaring with laughter Toddles and Poddles followed suit and Johnny trumped the trick T and P considering these favourable circumstances for the resumption of that dramatic descent upon Johnny again came across country hand in hand upon a buccaneering expedition and this having been fought out in the chimney corner behind missus Higden s chair with great valour on both sides those desperate pirates returned hand in hand to their stools across the dry bed of a mountain torrent You must tell me what I can do for you Betty my friend said missus Boffin confidentially if not to day next time Thank you all the same ma am but I want nothing for myself I can work I m strong I can walk twenty mile if I m put to it Old Betty was proud and said it with a sparkle in her bright eyes Yes but there are some little comforts that you wouldn t be the worse for returned missus Boffin Bless ye I wasn t born a lady any more than you It seems to me said Betty smiling that you were born a lady and a true one or there never was a lady born But I couldn t take anything from you my dear I never did take anything from any one It ain t that I m not grateful but I love to earn it better Well well returned missus Boffin I only spoke of little things or I wouldn t have taken the liberty Betty put her visitor s hand to her lips in acknowledgment of the delicate answer Wonderfully upright her figure was and wonderfully self reliant her look as standing facing her visitor she explained herself further If I could have kept the dear child without the dread that s always upon me of his coming to that fate I have spoken of I could never have parted with him even to you For I love him I love him I love him I love my husband long dead and gone in him I love my children dead and gone in him I love my young and hopeful days dead and gone in him I couldn t sell that love and look you in your bright kind face It s a free gift I am in want of nothing When my strength fails me if I can but die out quick and quiet I shall be quite content I have stood between my dead and that shame I have spoken of and it has been kept off from every one of them Sewed into my gown with her hand upon her breast is just enough to lay me in the grave Only see that it s rightly spent so as I may rest free to the last from that cruelty and disgrace and you ll have done much more than a little thing for me and all that in this present world my heart is set upon missus Betty Higden s visitor pressed her hand There was no more breaking up of the strong old face into weakness My Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards it really was as composed as our own faces and almost as dignified And now Johnny was to be inveigled into occupying a temporary position on missus Boffin s lap It was not until he had been piqued into competition with the two diminutive Minders by seeing them successively raised to that post and retire from it without injury that he could be by any means induced to leave missus Betty Higden s skirts towards which he exhibited even when in missus Boffin s embrace strong yearnings spiritual and bodily the former expressed in a very gloomy visage the latter in extended arms However a general description of the toy wonders lurking in mister Boffin s house so far conciliated this worldly minded orphan as to induce him to stare at her frowningly with a fist in his mouth and even at length to chuckle when a richly caparisoned horse on wheels with a miraculous gift of cantering to cake shops was mentioned This sound being taken up by the Minders swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction So the interview was considered very successful and missus Boffin was pleased and all were satisfied Not least of all Sloppy who undertook to conduct the visitors back by the best way to the Three Magpies and whom the hammer headed young man much despised This piece of business thus put in train the Secretary drove missus Boffin back to the Bower and found employment for himself at the new house until evening Whether when evening came he took a way to his lodgings that led through fields with any design of finding Miss Bella Wilfer in those fields is not so certain as that she regularly walked there at that hour And moreover it is certain that there she was No longer in mourning Miss Bella was dressed in as pretty colours as she could muster There is no denying that she was as pretty as they and that she and the colours went very prettily together She was reading as she walked and of course it is to be inferred from her showing no knowledge of mister Rokesmith s approach that she did not know he was approaching Eh said Miss Bella raising her eyes from her book when he stopped before her Oh It s you Only I A fine evening Is it said Bella looking coldly round I suppose it is now you mention it I have not been thinking of the evening So intent upon your book Ye e es replied Bella with a drawl of indifference A love story Miss Wilfer Oh dear no or I shouldn t be reading it It s more about money than anything else And does it say that money is better than anything Upon my word returned Bella I forget what it says but you can find out for yourself if you like mister Rokesmith I don t want it any more The Secretary took the book she had fluttered the leaves as if it were a fan and walked beside her I am charged with a message for you Miss Wilfer Impossible I think said Bella with another drawl From missus Boffin She desired me to assure you of the pleasure she has in finding that she will be ready to receive you in another week or two at furthest Bella turned her head towards him with her prettily insolent eyebrows raised and her eyelids drooping As much as to say How did YOU come by the message pray I have been waiting for an opportunity of telling you that I am mister Boffin s Secretary I am as wise as ever said Miss Bella loftily for I don t know what a Secretary is Not that it signifies Not at all A covert glance at her face as he walked beside her showed him that she had not expected his ready assent to that proposition Then are you going to be always there mister Rokesmith she inquired as if that would be a drawback Always No Very much there Yes Dear me drawled Bella in a tone of mortification But my position there as Secretary will be very different from yours as guest You will know little or nothing about me I shall transact the business you will transact the pleasure I shall have my salary to earn you will have nothing to do but to enjoy and attract Attract sir said Bella again with her eyebrows raised and her eyelids drooping I don t understand you Without replying on this point mister Rokesmith went on Excuse me when I first saw you in your black dress There was Miss Bella s mental exclamation What did I say to them at home Everybody noticed that ridiculous mourning When I first saw you in your black dress I was at a loss to account for that distinction between yourself and your family I hope it was not impertinent to speculate upon it I hope not I am sure said Miss Bella haughtily But you ought to know best how you speculated upon it mister Rokesmith inclined his head in a deprecatory manner and went on Since I have been entrusted with mister Boffin s affairs I have necessarily come to understand the little mystery I venture to remark that I feel persuaded that much of your loss may be repaired I speak of course merely of wealth Miss Wilfer The loss of a perfect stranger whose worth or worthlessness I cannot estimate nor you either is beside the question But this excellent gentleman and lady are so full of simplicity so full of generosity so inclined towards you and so desirous to how shall I express it to make amends for their good fortune that you have only to respond As he watched her with another covert look he saw a certain ambitious triumph in her face which no assumed coldness could conceal As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of circumstances which oddly extends itself to the new relations before us I have taken the liberty of saying these few words You don t consider them intrusive I hope said the Secretary with deference Really mister Rokesmith I can t say what I consider them returned the young lady They are perfectly new to me and may be founded altogether on your own imagination You will see These same fields were opposite the Wilfer premises The discreet missus Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding her daughter in conference with her lodger instantly tied up her head and came out for a casual walk I have been telling Miss Wilfer said John Rokesmith as the majestic lady came stalking up that I have become by a curious chance mister Boffin s Secretary or man of business I have not returned missus Wilfer waving her gloves in her chronic state of dignity and vague ill usage the honour of any intimate acquaintance with mister Boffin and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition he has made A poor one enough said Rokesmith Pardon me returned missus Wilfer the merits of mister Boffin may be highly distinguished may be more distinguished than the countenance of missus Boffin would imply but it were the insanity of humility to deem him worthy of a better assistant You are very good I have also been telling Miss Wilfer that she is expected very shortly at the new residence in town Having tacitly consented said missus Wilfer with a grand shrug of her shoulders and another wave of her gloves to my child s acceptance of the proffered attentions of missus Boffin I interpose no objection Here Miss Bella offered the remonstrance Don t talk nonsense ma please Peace said missus Wilfer No ma I am not going to be made so absurd Interposing objections I say repeated missus Wilfer with a vast access of grandeur that I am NOT going to interpose objections If missus Boffin to whose countenance no disciple of Lavater could possibly for a single moment subscribe with a shiver seeks to illuminate her new residence in town with the attractions of a child of mine I am content that she should be favoured by the company of a child of mine You use the word ma am I have myself used said Rokesmith with a glance at Bella when you speak of Miss Wilfer s attractions there Pardon me returned missus Wilfer with dreadful solemnity but I had not finished Pray excuse me I was about to say pursued missus Wilfer who clearly had not had the faintest idea of saying anything more that when I use the term attractions I do so with the qualification that I do not mean it in any way whatever The excellent lady delivered this luminous elucidation of her views with an air of greatly obliging her hearers and greatly distinguishing herself Whereat Miss Bella laughed a scornful little laugh and said Quite enough about this I am sure on all sides Have the goodness mister Rokesmith to give my love to missus Boffin Pardon me cried missus Wilfer Compliments Love repeated Bella with a little stamp of her foot No said missus Wilfer monotonously Compliments Say Miss Wilfer s love and missus Wilfer s compliments the Secretary proposed as a compromise And I shall be very glad to come when she is ready for me The sooner the better One last word Bella said missus Wilfer before descending to the family apartment I trust that as a child of mine you will ever be sensible that it will be graceful in you when associating with mister and missus Boffin upon equal terms to remember that the Secretary mister Rokesmith as your father s lodger has a claim on your good word The condescension with which missus Wilfer delivered this proclamation of patronage was as wonderful as the swiftness with which the lodger had lost caste in the Secretary He smiled as the mother retired down stairs but his face fell as the daughter followed So insolent so trivial so capricious so mercenary so careless so hard to touch so hard to turn he said bitterly And added as he went upstairs And yet so pretty so pretty And added presently as he walked to and fro in his room And if she knew She knew that he was shaking the house by his walking to and fro and she declared it another of the miseries of being poor that you couldn t get rid of a haunting Secretary stump stump stumping overhead in the dark like a Ghost Chapter seventeen A DISMAL SWAMP And now in the blooming summer days behold mister and missus Boffin established in the eminently aristocratic family mansion and behold all manner of crawling creeping fluttering and buzzing creatures attracted by the gold dust of the Golden Dustman Foremost among those leaving cards at the eminently aristocratic door before it is quite painted are the Veneerings out of breath one might imagine from the impetuosity of their rush to the eminently aristocratic steps One copper plate missus Veneering two copper plate mister Veneerings and a connubial copper plate mister and missus Veneering requesting the honour of mister and missus Boffin s company at dinner with the utmost Analytical solemnities The enchanting Lady Tippins leaves a card Twemlow leaves cards A tall custard coloured phaeton tooling up in a solemn manner leaves four cards to wit a couple of mister Podsnaps a missus Podsnap and a Miss Podsnap All the world and his wife and daughter leave cards Sometimes the world s wife has so many daughters that her card reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction comprising missus Tapkins Miss Tapkins Miss Frederica Tapkins Miss Antonina Tapkins Miss Malvina Tapkins and Miss Euphemia Tapkins at the same time the same lady leaves the card of missus Henry George Alfred Swoshle NEE Tapkins also a card missus Tapkins at Home Wednesdays Music Portland Place Miss Bella Wilfer becomes an inmate for an indefinite period of the eminently aristocratic dwelling missus Boffin bears Miss Bella away to her Milliner s and Dressmaker s and she gets beautifully dressed The Veneerings find with swift remorse that they have omitted to invite Miss Bella Wilfer One missus Veneering and one mister and missus Veneering requesting that additional honour instantly do penance in white cardboard on the hall table missus Tapkins likewise discovers her omission and with promptitude repairs it for herself for Miss Tapkins for Miss Frederica Tapkins for Miss Antonina Tapkins for Miss Malvina Tapkins and for Miss Euphemia Tapkins Likewise for missus Henry George Alfred Swoshle NEE Tapkins Likewise for missus Tapkins at Home Wednesdays Music Portland Place Tradesmen s books hunger and tradesmen s mouths water for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman As missus Boffin and Miss Wilfer drive out or as mister Boffin walks out at his jog trot pace the fishmonger pulls off his hat with an air of reverence founded on conviction His men cleanse their fingers on their woollen aprons before presuming to touch their foreheads to mister Boffin or Lady The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways as they would turn up their hands if they had any in worshipping admiration The butcher though a portly and a prosperous man doesn t know what to do with himself so anxious is he to express humility when discovered by the passing Boffins taking the air in a mutton grove Presents are made to the Boffin servants and bland strangers with business cards meeting said servants in the street offer hypothetical corruption As Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from mister Boffin my dear friend it would be worth my while to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings But no one knows so well as the Secretary who opens and reads the letters what a set is made at the man marked by a stroke of notoriety Oh the varieties of dust for ocular use offered in exchange for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman Fifty seven churches to be erected with half crowns forty two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings seven and twenty organs to be built with halfpence twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps Not that a half crown shilling halfpenny or postage stamp would be particularly acceptable from mister Boffin but that it is so obvious he is the man to make up the deficiency And then the charities my Christian brother And mostly in difficulties yet mostly lavish too in the expensive articles of print and paper Large fat private double letter sealed with ducal coronet Nicodemus Boffin Esquire My Dear Sir Having consented to preside at the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund and feeling deeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution and the great importance of its being supported by a List of Stewards that shall prove to the public the interest taken in it by popular and distinguished men I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on that occasion Soliciting your favourable reply before the fourteenth instant I am My Dear Sir Your faithful Servant LINSEED P S The Steward s fee is limited to three Guineas Friendly this on the part of the Duke of Linseed and thoughtful in the postscript only lithographed by the hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to Nicodemus Boffin Esquire in quite another hand It takes two noble Earls and a Viscount combined to inform Nicodemus Boffin Esquire in an equally flattering manner that an estimable lady in the West of England has offered to present a purse containing twenty pounds to the Society for Granting Annuities to Unassuming Members of the Middle Classes if twenty individuals will previously present purses of one hundred pounds each And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out that if Nicodemus Boffin Esquire should wish to present two or more purses it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable lady in the West of England provided each purse be coupled with the name of some member of his honoured and respected family These are the corporate beggars But there are besides the individual beggars and how does the heart of the Secretary fail him when he has to cope with THEM And they must be coped with to some extent because they all enclose documents they call their scraps documents but they are as to papers deserving the name what minced veal is to a calf the non return of which would be their ruin That is say they are utterly ruined now but they would be more utterly ruined then Among these correspondents are several daughters of general officers long accustomed to every luxury of life except spelling who little thought when their gallant fathers waged war in the Peninsula that they would ever have to appeal to those whom Providence in its inscrutable wisdom has blessed with untold gold and from among whom they select the name of Nicodemus Boffin Esquire for a maiden effort in this wise understanding that he has such a heart as never was The Secretary learns too that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress so numerous are the wives who take up their pens to ask mister Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted husbands who would never permit it while on the other hand so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens to ask mister Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted wives who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least suspicion of the circumstance There are the inspired beggars too These were sitting only yesterday evening musing over a fragment of candle which must soon go out and leave them in the dark for the rest of their nights when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus Boffin Esquire to their souls imparting rays of hope nay confidence to which they had long been strangers Akin to these are the suggestively befriended beggars They were partaking of a cold potato and water by the flickering and gloomy light of a lucifer match in their lodgings rent considerably in arrear and heartless landlady threatening expulsion like a dog into the streets when a gifted friend happening to look in said Write immediately to Nicodemus Boffin Esquire and would take no denial There are the nobly independent beggars too These in the days of their abundance ever regarded gold as dross and have not yet got over that only impediment in the way of their amassing wealth but they want no dross from Nicodemus Boffin Esquire No mister Boffin the world may term it pride paltry pride if you will but they wouldn t take it if you offered it a loan sir for fourteen weeks to the day interest calculated at the rate of five per cent per annum to be bestowed upon any charitable institution you may name is all they want of you and if you have the meanness to refuse it count on being despised by these great spirits There are the beggars of punctual business habits too These will make an end of themselves at a quarter to one P M on Tuesday if no Post office order is in the interim received from Nicodemus Boffin Esquire arriving after a quarter to one P M on Tuesday it need not be sent as they will then having made an exact memorandum of the heartless circumstances be cold in death There are the beggars on horseback too in another sense from the sense of the proverb These are mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence The goal is before them the road is in the best condition their spurs are on the steed is willing but at the last moment for want of some special thing a clock a violin an astronomical telescope an electrifying machine they must dismount for ever unless they receive its equivalent in money from Nicodemus Boffin Esquire Less given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures These usually to be addressed in reply under initials at a country post office inquire in feminine hands Dare one who cannot disclose herself to Nicodemus Boffin Esquire but whose name might startle him were it revealed solicit the immediate advance of two hundred pounds from unexpected riches exercising their noblest privilege in the trust of a common humanity In such a Dismal Swamp does the new house stand and through it does the Secretary daily struggle breast high Not to mention all the people alive who have made inventions that won t act and all the jobbers who job in all the jobberies jobbed though these may be regarded as the Alligators of the Dismal Swamp and are always lying by to drag the Golden Dustman under But the old house There are no designs against the Golden Dustman there There are no fish of the shark tribe in the Bower waters Perhaps not Still Wegg is established there and would seem judged by his secret proceedings to cherish a notion of making a discovery For when a man with a wooden leg lies prone on his stomach to peep under bedsteads and hops up ladders like some extinct bird to survey the tops of presses and cupboards and provides himself an iron rod which he is always poking and prodding into dust mounds the probability is that he expects to find something BOOK THE SECOND BIRDS OF A FEATHER Chapter one OF AN EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book the streets being for pupils of his degree the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable it was crowded noisy and confusing half the pupils dropped asleep or fell into a state of waking stupefaction the other half kept them in either condition by maintaining a monotonous droning noise as if they were performing out of time and tune on a ruder sort of bagpipe The teachers animated solely by good intentions had no idea of execution and a lamentable jumble was the upshot of their kind endeavours It was a school for all ages and for both sexes The latter were kept apart and the former were partitioned off into square assortments But all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil was childish and innocent This pretence much favoured by the lady visitors led to the ghastliest absurdities Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child s book the Adventures of Little Margery who resided in the village cottage by the mill severely reproved and morally squashed the miller when she was five and he was fifty divided her porridge with singing birds denied herself a new nankeen bonnet on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets neither did the sheep who ate them who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers at all sorts of unseasonable times So unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence who having resolved not to rob under circumstances of uncommon atrocity his particular friend and benefactor of eighteenpence presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence and lived a shining light ever afterwards Note that the benefactor came to no good Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons that you were to do good not because it WAS good but because you were to make a good thing of it Contrariwise the adult pupils were taught to read if they could learn out of the New Testament and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history as if they had never seen or heard of it An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school in fact where black spirits and grey red spirits and white jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled every night And particularly every Sunday night For then an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good intentions whom nobody older would endure Who taking his stand on the floor before them as chief executioner would be attended by a conventional volunteer boy as executioner s assistant When and where it first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand or when and where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in operation and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it matters not It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants yawning infants restless infants whimpering infants and smooth their wretched faces sometimes with one hand as if he were anointing them for a whisker sometimes with both hands applied after the fashion of blinkers And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr let us say for example about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre and repeating the word Sepulchre commonly used among infants five hundred times and never once hinting what it meant the conventional boy smoothing away right and left as an infallible commentary the whole hot bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles rashes whooping cough fever and stomach disorders as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose Even in this temple of good intentions an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn could learn something and having learned it could impart it much better than the teachers as being more knowing than they and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble taught in the jumble and been received from the jumble into a better school So you want to go and see your sister Hexam If you please mister Headstone I have half a mind to go with you Where does your sister live Why she is not settled yet mister Headstone I d rather you didn t see her till she is settled if it was all the same to you Look here Hexam mister Bradley Headstone highly certificated stipendiary schoolmaster drew his right forefinger through one of the buttonholes of the boy s coat and looked at it attentively I hope your sister may be good company for you Why do you doubt it mister Headstone I did not say I doubted it No sir you didn t say so Bradley Headstone looked at his finger again took it out of the buttonhole and looked at it closer bit the side of it and looked at it again You see Hexam you will be one of us In good time you are sure to pass a creditable examination and become one of us Then the question is The boy waited so long for the question while the schoolmaster looked at a new side of his finger and bit it and looked at it again that at length the boy repeated The question is sir Whether you had not better leave well alone Is it well to leave my sister alone mister Headstone I do not say so because I do not know I put it to you I ask you to think of it I want you to consider You know how well you are doing here After all she got me here said the boy with a struggle Perceiving the necessity of it acquiesced the schoolmaster and making up her mind fully to the separation Yes The boy with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever it was seemed to debate with himself At length he said raising his eyes to the master s face I wish you d come with me and see her mister Headstone though she is not settled I wish you d come with me and take her in the rough and judge her for yourself You are sure you would not like asked the schoolmaster to prepare her My sister Lizzie said the boy proudly wants no preparing mister Headstone What she is she is and shows herself to be There s no pretending about my sister His confidence in her sat more easily upon him than the indecision with which he had twice contended It was his better nature to be true to her if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish And as yet the better nature had the stronger hold Well I can spare the evening said the schoolmaster I am ready to walk with you Thank you mister Headstone And I am ready to go Bradley Headstone in his decent black coat and waistcoat and decent white shirt and decent formal black tie and decent pantaloons of pepper and salt with his decent silver watch in his pocket and its decent hair guard round his neck looked a thoroughly decent young man of six and twenty He was never seen in any other dress and yet there was a certain stiffness in his manner of wearing this as if there were a want of adaptation between him and it recalling some mechanics in their holiday clothes He had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher s knowledge He could do mental arithmetic mechanically sing at sight mechanically blow various wind instruments mechanically even play the great church organ mechanically From his early childhood up his mind had been a place of mechanical stowage The arrangement of his wholesale warehouse so that it might be always ready to meet the demands of retail dealers history here geography there astronomy to the right political economy to the left natural history the physical sciences figures music the lower mathematics and what not all in their several places this care had imparted to his countenance a look of care while the habit of questioning and being questioned had given him a suspicious manner or a manner that would be better described as one of lying in wait There was a kind of settled trouble in the face It was the face belonging to a naturally slow or inattentive intellect that had toiled hard to get what it had won and that had to hold it now that it was gotten He always seemed to be uneasy lest anything should be missing from his mental warehouse and taking stock to assure himself Suppression of so much to make room for so much had given him a constrained manner over and above Yet there was enough of what was animal and of what was fiery though smouldering still visible in him to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone when a pauper lad had chanced to be told off for the sea he would not have been the last man in a ship s crew Regarding that origin of his he was proud moody and sullen desiring it to be forgotten And few people knew of it In some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this boy Hexam An undeniable boy for a pupil teacher an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on Combined with this consideration there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now never to be mentioned Be that how it might he had with pains gradually worked the boy into his own school and procured him some offices to discharge there which were repaid with food and lodging Such were the circumstances that had brought together Bradley Headstone and young Charley Hexam that autumn evening Autumn because full half a year had come and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river shore The schools for they were twofold as the sexes were down in that district of the flat country tending to the Thames where Kent and Surrey meet and where the railways still bestride the market gardens that will soon die under them The schools were newly built and there were so many like them all over the country that one might have thought the whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin s palace They were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy neighbourhood taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly incoherent mind and set up anyhow here one side of a new street there a large solitary public house facing nowhere here another unfinished street already in ruins there a church here an immense new warehouse there a dilapidated old country villa then a medley of black ditch sparkling cucumber frame rank field richly cultivated kitchen garden brick viaduct arch spanned canal and disorder of frowziness and fog As if the child had given the table a kick and gone to sleep But even among school buildings school teachers and school pupils all according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest Gospel according to Monotony the older pattern into which so many fortunes have been shaped for good and evil comes out It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress watering her flowers as mister Bradley Headstone walked forth It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence with little windows like the eyes in needles and little doors like the covers of school books Small shining neat methodical and buxom was Miss Peecher cherry cheeked and tuneful of voice A little pincushion a little housewife a little book a little workbox a little set of tables and weights and measures and a little woman all in one She could write a little essay on any subject exactly a slate long beginning at the left hand top of one side and ending at the right hand bottom of the other and the essay should be strictly according to rule If mister Bradley Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her she would probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a slate long but would certainly have replied Yes For she loved him The decent hair guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her So would Miss Peecher have gone round his neck and taken care of him Of him insensible Because he did not love Miss Peecher Miss Peecher s favourite pupil who assisted her in her little household was in attendance with a can of water to replenish her little watering pot and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher s affections to feel it necessary that she herself should love young Charley Hexam So there was a double palpitation among the double stocks and double wall flowers when the master and the boy looked over the little gate A fine evening Miss Peecher said the Master A very fine evening mister Headstone said Miss Peecher Are you taking a walk Hexam and I are going to take a long walk Charming weather remarked Miss Peecher FOR a long walk Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure said the Master Miss Peecher inverting her watering pot and very carefully shaking out the few last drops over a flower as if there were some special virtue in them which would make it a Jack s beanstalk before morning called for replenishment to her pupil who had been speaking to the boy Good night Miss Peecher said the Master Good night mister Headstone said the Mistress The pupil had been in her state of pupilage so imbued with the class custom of stretching out an arm as if to hail a cab or omnibus whenever she found she had an observation on hand to offer to Miss Peecher that she often did it in their domestic relations and she did it now Well Mary Anne said Miss Peecher If you please ma am Hexam said they were going to see his sister But that can t be I think returned Miss Peecher because mister Headstone can have no business with HER Mary Anne again hailed Well Mary Anne If you please ma am perhaps it s Hexam s business That may be said Miss Peecher I didn t think of that Not that it matters at all Mary Anne again hailed Well Mary Anne They say she s very handsome Oh Mary Anne Mary Anne returned Miss Peecher slightly colouring and shaking her head a little out of humour how often have I told you not to use that vague expression not to speak in that general way When you say THEY say what do you mean Part of speech They Mary Anne hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand as being under examination and replied Personal pronoun Person They Third person Number They Plural number Then how many do you mean Mary Anne Two Or more I beg your pardon ma am said Mary Anne disconcerted now she came to think of it but I don t know that I mean more than her brother himself As she said it she unhooked her arm I felt convinced of it returned Miss Peecher smiling again Now pray Mary Anne be careful another time He says is very different from they say remember Difference between he says and they say Give it me Mary Anne immediately hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation and replied One is indicative mood present tense third person singular verb active to say Other is indicative mood present tense third person plural verb active to say Why verb active Mary Anne Because it takes a pronoun after it in the objective case Miss Peecher Very good indeed remarked Miss Peecher with encouragement In fact could not be better Don t forget to apply it another time Mary Anne This said Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers and went into her little official residence and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world their breadths depths and heights before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own personal occupation Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge and crossed the bridge and made along the Middlesex shore towards Millbank In this region are a certain little street called Church Street and a certain little blind square called Smith Square in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners generally resembling some petrified monster frightful and gigantic on its back with its legs in the air They found a tree near by in a corner and a blacksmith s forge and a timber yard and a dealer s in old iron What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half buried in the dealer s fore court nobody seemed to know or to want to know Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song They cared for Nobody no not they and Nobody cared for them After making the round of this place and noting that there was a deadly kind of repose on it more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen into a natural rest they stopped at the point where the street and the square joined and where there were some little quiet houses in a row To these Charley Hexam finally led the way and at one of these stopped This must be where my sister lives sir This is where she came for a temporary lodging soon after father s death How often have you seen her since Why only twice sir returned the boy with his former reluctance but that s as much her doing as mine How does she support herself She was always a fair needlewoman and she keeps the stockroom of a seaman s outfitter Does she ever work at her own lodging here Sometimes but her regular hours and regular occupation are at their place of business I believe sir This is the number The boy knocked at a door and the door promptly opened with a spring and a click A parlour door within a small entry stood open and disclosed a child a dwarf a girl a something sitting on a little low old fashioned arm chair which had a kind of little working bench before it I can t get up said the child because my back s bad and my legs are queer But I m the person of the house Who else is at home asked Charley Hexam staring Nobody s at home at present returned the child with a glib assertion of her dignity except the person of the house What did you want young man I wanted to see my sister Many young men have sisters returned the child Give me your name young man The queer little figure and the queer but not ugly little face with its bright grey eyes were so sharp that the sharpness of the manner seemed unavoidable As if being turned out of that mould it must be sharp Hexam is my name Ah indeed said the person of the house I thought it might be Your sister will be in in about a quarter of an hour I am very fond of your sister She s my particular friend Take a seat And this gentleman s name mister Headstone my schoolmaster Take a seat And would you please to shut the street door first I can t very well do it myself because my back s so bad and my legs are so queer They complied in silence and the little figure went on with its work of gumming or gluing together with a camel s hair brush certain pieces of cardboard and thin wood previously cut into various shapes The scissors and knives upon the bench showed that the child herself had cut them and the bright scraps of velvet and silk and ribbon also strewn upon the bench showed that when duly stuffed and stuffing too was there she was to cover them smartly The dexterity of her nimble fingers was remarkable and as she brought two thin edges accurately together by giving them a little bite she would glance at the visitors out of the corners of her grey eyes with a look that out sharpened all her other sharpness You can t tell me the name of my trade I ll be bound she said after taking several of these observations You make pincushions said Charley What else do I make Pen wipers said Bradley Headstone Ha ha What else do I make You re a schoolmaster but you can t tell me You do something he returned pointing to a corner of the little bench with straw but I don t know what Well done you cried the person of the house I only make pincushions and pen wipers to use up my waste But my straw really does belong to my business Try again What do I make with my straw Dinner mats A schoolmaster and says dinner mats I ll give you a clue to my trade in a game of forfeits I love my love with a B because she s Beautiful I hate my love with a B because she is Brazen I took her to the sign of the Blue Boar and I treated her with Bonnets her name s Bouncer and she lives in Bedlam Now what do I make with my straw Ladies bonnets Fine ladies said the person of the house nodding assent Dolls I m a Doll s Dressmaker I hope it s a good business The person of the house shrugged her shoulders and shook her head No Poorly paid And I m often so pressed for time I had a doll married last week and was obliged to work all night And it s not good for me on account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer They looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish and the schoolmaster said I am sorry your fine ladies are so inconsiderate It s the way with them said the person of the house shrugging her shoulders again And they take no care of their clothes and they never keep to the same fashions a month I work for a doll with three daughters Bless you she s enough to ruin her husband The person of the house gave a weird little laugh here and gave them another look out of the corners of her eyes She had an elfin chin that was capable of great expression and whenever she gave this look she hitched this chin up As if her eyes and her chin worked together on the same wires Are you always as busy as you are now Busier I m slack just now I finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday Doll I work for lost a canary bird The person of the house gave another little laugh and then nodded her head several times as who should moralize Oh this world this world Are you alone all day asked Bradley Headstone Don t any of the neighbouring children Ah lud cried the person of the house with a little scream as if the word had pricked her Don t talk of children I can t bear children I know their tricks and their manners She said this with an angry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes Perhaps it scarcely required the teacher habit to perceive that the doll s dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between herself and other children But both master and pupil understood it so Always running about and screeching always playing and fighting always skip skip skipping on the pavement and chalking it for their games Oh I know their tricks and their manners Shaking the little fist as before And that s not all Ever so often calling names in through a person s keyhole and imitating a person s back and legs Oh I know their tricks and their manners And I ll tell you what I d do to punish em There s doors under the church in the Square black doors leading into black vaults Well I d open one of those doors and I d cram em all in and then I d lock the door and through the keyhole I d blow in pepper What would be the good of blowing in pepper asked Charley Hexam To set em sneezing said the person of the house and make their eyes water And when they were all sneezing and inflamed I d mock em through the keyhole Just as they with their tricks and their manners mock a person through a person s keyhole An uncommonly emphatic shake of her little fist close before her eyes seemed to ease the mind of the person of the house for she added with recovered composure No no no No children for me Give me grown ups It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature for her poor figure furnished no clue to it and her face was at once so young and so old Twelve or at the most thirteen might be near the mark I always did like grown ups she went on and always kept company with them So sensible Sit so quiet Don t go prancing and capering about And I mean always to keep among none but grown ups till I marry I suppose I must make up my mind to marry one of these days She listened to a step outside that caught her ear and there was a soft knock at the door Pulling at a handle within her reach she said with a pleased laugh Now here for instance is a grown up that s my particular friend and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room Charley You Taking him to her arms in the old way of which he seemed a little ashamed she saw no one else There there there Liz all right my dear See Here s mister Headstone come with me Her eyes met those of the schoolmaster who had evidently expected to see a very different sort of person and a murmured word or two of salutation passed between them She was a little flurried by the unexpected visit and the schoolmaster was not at his ease But he never was quite I told mister Headstone you were not settled Liz but he was so kind as to take an interest in coming and so I brought him How well you look Bradley seemed to think so Ah Don t she don t she cried the person of the house resuming her occupation though the twilight was falling fast I believe you she does But go on with your chat one and all You one two three My com pa nie And don t mind me pointing this impromptu rhyme with three points of her thin fore finger I didn t expect a visit from you Charley said his sister I supposed that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me appointing me to come somewhere near the school as I did last time I saw my brother near the school sir to Bradley Headstone because it s easier for me to go there than for him to come here I work about midway between the two places You don t see much of one another said Bradley not improving in respect of ease No With a rather sad shake of her head Charley always does well mister Headstone He could not do better I regard his course as quite plain before him I hoped so I am so thankful So well done of you Charley dear It is better for me not to come except when he wants me between him and his prospects You think so mister Headstone Conscious that his pupil teacher was looking for his answer that he himself had suggested the boy s keeping aloof from this sister now seen for the first time face to face Bradley Headstone stammered Your brother is very much occupied you know He has to work hard One cannot but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work the better for his future When he shall have established himself why then it will be another thing then Lizzie shook her head again and returned with a quiet smile I always advised him as you advise him Did I not Charley Well never mind that now said the boy How are you getting on Very well Charley I want for nothing You have your own room here Oh yes Upstairs And it s quiet and pleasant and airy And she always has the use of this room for visitors said the person of the house screwing up one of her little bony fists like an opera glass and looking through it with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance Always this room for visitors haven t you Lizzie dear It happened that Bradley Headstone noticed a very slight action of Lizzie Hexam s hand as though it checked the doll s dressmaker And it happened that the latter noticed him in the same instant for she made a double eyeglass of her two hands looked at him through it and cried with a waggish shake of her head Aha Caught you spying did I It might have fallen out so any way but Bradley Headstone also noticed that immediately after this Lizzie who had not taken off her bonnet rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go out into the air They went out the visitors saying good night to the doll s dressmaker whom they left leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice I ll saunter on by the river said Bradley You will be glad to talk together As his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows the boy said to his sister petulantly When are you going to settle yourself in some Christian sort of place Liz I thought you were going to do it before now I am very well where I am Charley Very well where you are I am ashamed to have brought mister Headstone with me How came you to get into such company as that little witch s By chance at first as it seemed Charley But I think it must have been by something more than chance for that child You remember the bills upon the walls at home Confound the bills upon the walls at home I want to forget the bills upon the walls at home and it would be better for you to do the same grumbled the boy Well what of them This child is the grandchild of the old man What old man The terrible drunken old man in the list slippers and the night cap The boy asked rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation at hearing so much and half curiosity to hear more How came you to make that out What a girl you are The child s father is employed by the house that employs me that s how I came to know it Charley The father is like his own father a weak wretched trembling creature falling to pieces never sober But a good workman too at the work he does The mother is dead This poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is surrounded by drunken people from her cradle if she ever had one Charley I don t see what you have to do with her for all that said the boy Don t you Charley The boy looked doggedly at the river They were at Millbank and the river rolled on their left His sister gently touched him on the shoulder and pointed to it Any compensation restitution never mind the word you know my meaning Father s grave But he did not respond with any tenderness After a moody silence he broke out in an ill used tone It ll be a very hard thing Liz if when I am trying my best to get up in the world you pull me back I Charley Yes you Liz Why can t you let bygones be bygones Why can t you as mister Headstone said to me this very evening about another matter leave well alone What we have got to do is to turn our faces full in our new direction and keep straight on And never look back Not even to try to make some amends You are such a dreamer said the boy with his former petulance It was all very well when we sat before the fire when we looked into the hollow down by the flare but we are looking into the real world now Ah we were looking into the real world then Charley I understand what you mean by that but you are not justified in it I don t want as I raise myself to shake you off Liz I want to carry you up with me That s what I want to do and mean to do I know what I owe you I said to mister Headstone this very evening After all my sister got me here Well then Don t pull me back and hold me down That s all I ask and surely that s not unconscionable She had kept a steadfast look upon him and she answered with composure I am not here selfishly Charley To please myself I could not be too far from that river Nor could you be too far from it to please me Let us get quit of it equally Why should you linger about it any more than I I give it a wide berth I can t get away from it I think said Lizzie passing her hand across her forehead It s no purpose of mine that I live by it still There you go Liz Dreaming again You lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken tailor I suppose or something of the sort and a little crooked antic of a child or old person or whatever it is and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there Now do be more practical She had been practical enough with him in suffering and striving for him but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder not reproachfully and tapped it twice or thrice She had been used to do so to soothe him when she carried him about a child as heavy as herself Tears started to his eyes Upon my word Liz drawing the back of his hand across them I mean to be a good brother to you and to prove that I know what I owe you All I say is that I hope you ll control your fancies a little on my account I ll get a school and then you must come and live with me and you ll have to control your fancies then so why not now Now say I haven t vexed you You haven t Charley you haven t And say I haven t hurt you You haven t Charley But this answer was less ready Say you are sure I didn t mean to Come There s mister Headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide to hint that it s time to go Kiss me and tell me that you know I didn t mean to hurt you She told him so and they embraced and walked on and came up with the schoolmaster But we go your sister s way he remarked when the boy told him he was ready And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his arm Her hand was just within it when she drew it back He looked round with a start as if he thought she had detected something that repelled her in the momentary touch I will not go in just yet said Lizzie And you have a distance before you and will walk faster without me Being by this time close to Vauxhall Bridge they resolved in consequence to take that way over the Thames and they left her Bradley Headstone giving her his hand at parting and she thanking him for his care of her brother The master and the pupil walked on rapidly and silently They had nearly crossed the bridge when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them with a cigar in his mouth his coat thrown back and his hands behind him Something in the careless manner of this person and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed instantly caught the boy s attention As the gentleman passed the boy looked at him narrowly and then stood still looking after him Who is it that you stare after asked Bradley Why said the boy with a confused and pondering frown upon his face It IS that Wrayburn one Bradley Headstone scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had scrutinized the gentleman I beg your pardon mister Headstone but I couldn t help wondering what in the world brought HIM here Though he said it as if his wonder were past at the same time resuming the walk it was not lost upon the master that he looked over his shoulder after speaking and that the same perplexed and pondering frown was heavy on his face You don t appear to like your friend Hexam I DON T like him said the boy Why not He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way the first time I ever saw him said the boy Again why For nothing Or it s much the same because something I happened to say about my sister didn t happen to please him Then he knows your sister He didn t at that time said the boy still moodily pondering Does now The boy had so lost himself that he looked at mister Bradley Headstone as they walked on side by side without attempting to reply until the question had been repeated then he nodded and answered Yes sir Going to see her I dare say It can t be said the boy quickly He doesn t know her well enough I should like to catch him at it When they had walked on for a time more rapidly than before the master said clasping the pupil s arm between the elbow and the shoulder with his hand You were going to tell me something about that person What did you say his name was Wrayburn mister Eugene Wrayburn He is what they call a barrister with nothing to do The first time he came to our old place was when my father was alive He came on business not that it was HIS business HE never had any business he was brought by a friend of his And the other times There was only one other time that I know of When my father was killed by accident he chanced to be one of the finders He was mooning about I suppose taking liberties with people s chins but there he was somehow He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning and brought Miss Abbey Potterson a neighbour to help break it to her He was mooning about the house when I was fetched home in the afternoon they didn t know where to find me till my sister could be brought round sufficiently to tell them and then he mooned away And is that all That s all sir Bradley Headstone gradually released the boy s arm as if he were thoughtful and they walked on side by side as before After a long silence between them Bradley resumed the talk I suppose your sister with a curious break both before and after the words has received hardly any teaching Hexam Hardly any sir Sacrificed no doubt to her father s objections I remember them in your case Yet your sister scarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person Lizzie has as much thought as the best mister Headstone Too much perhaps without teaching I used to call the fire at home her books for she was always full of fancies sometimes quite wise fancies considering when she sat looking at it I don t like that said Bradley Headstone His pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden and decided and emotional an objection but took it as a proof of the master s interest in himself It emboldened him to say I have never brought myself to mention it openly to you mister Headstone and you re my witness that I couldn t even make up my mind to take it from you before we came out to night but it s a painful thing to think that if I get on as well as you hope I shall be I won t say disgraced because I don t mean disgraced but rather put to the blush if it was known by a sister who has been very good to me Yes said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point so smoothly did it glide to another and there is this possibility to consider Some man who had worked his way might come to admire your sister and might even in time bring himself to think of marrying your sister and it would be a sad drawback and a heavy penalty upon him if overcoming in his mind other inequalities of condition and other considerations against it this inequality and this consideration remained in full force That s much my own meaning sir Ay ay said Bradley Headstone but you spoke of a mere brother Now the case I have supposed would be a much stronger case because an admirer a husband would form the connexion voluntarily besides being obliged to proclaim it which a brother is not After all you know it must be said of you that you couldn t help yourself while it would be said of him with equal reason that he could That s true sir Sometimes since Lizzie was left free by father s death I have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pass muster And sometimes I have even thought that perhaps Miss Peecher For the purpose I would advise Not Miss Peecher Bradley Headstone struck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner Would you be so kind as to think of it for me mister Headstone Yes Hexam yes I ll think of it I ll think maturely of it I ll think well of it Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards until it ended at the school house There one of neat Miss Peecher s little windows like the eyes in needles was illuminated and in a corner near it sat Mary Anne watching while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing N B Miss Peecher and Miss Peecher s pupils were not much encouraged in the unscholastic art of needlework by Government Mary Anne with her face to the window held her arm up Well Mary Anne mister Headstone coming home ma am In about a minute Mary Anne again hailed Yes Mary Anne Gone in and locked his door ma am Miss Peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if she had had the dress on with a sharp sharp needle Chapter two STILL EDUCATIONAL The person of the house doll s dressmaker and manufacturer of ornamental pincushions and pen wipers sat in her quaint little low arm chair singing in the dark until Lizzie came back The person of the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years indeed through being the only trustworthy person IN the house Well Lizzie Mizzie Wizzie said she breaking off in her song what s the news out of doors What s the news in doors returned Lizzie playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll s dressmaker Let me see said the blind man Why the last news is that I don t mean to marry your brother No No o shaking her head and her chin Don t like the boy What do you say to his master I say that I think he s bespoke Lizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders and then lighted a candle It showed the little parlour to be dingy but orderly and clean She stood it on the mantelshelf remote from the dressmaker s eyes and then put the room door open and the house door open and turned the little low chair and its occupant towards the outer air It was a sultry night and this was a fine weather arrangement when the day s work was done To complete it she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her This is what your loving Jenny Wren calls the best time in the day and night said the person of the house Her real name was Fanny Cleaver but she had long ago chosen to bestow upon herself the appellation of Miss Jenny Wren I have been thinking Jenny went on as I sat at work to day what a thing it would be if I should be able to have your company till I am married or at least courted Because when I am courted I shall make Him do some of the things that you do for me He couldn t brush my hair like you do or help me up and down stairs like you do and he couldn t do anything like you do but he could take my work home and he could call for orders in his clumsy way And he shall too I LL trot him about I can tell him Jenny Wren had her personal vanities happily for her and no intentions were stronger in her breast than the various trials and torments that were in the fulness of time to be inflicted upon him Wherever he may happen to be just at present or whoever he may happen to be said Miss Wren I know his tricks and his manners and I give him warning to look out Don t you think you are rather hard upon him asked her friend smiling and smoothing her hair Not a bit replied the sage Miss Wren with an air of vast experience My dear they don t care for you those fellows if you re NOT hard upon em But I was saying If I should be able to have your company Ah What a large If Ain t it I have no intention of parting company Jenny Don t say that or you ll go directly Am I so little to be relied upon You re more to be relied upon than silver and gold As she said it Miss Wren suddenly broke off screwed up her eyes and her chin and looked prodigiously knowing Aha Who comes here A Grenadier What does he want A pot of beer And nothing else in the world my dear A man s figure paused on the pavement at the outer door mister Eugene Wrayburn ain t it said Miss Wren So I am told was the answer You may come in if you re good I am not good said Eugene but I ll come in He gave his hand to Jenny Wren and he gave his hand to Lizzie and he stood leaning by the door at Lizzie s side He had been strolling with his cigar he said it was smoked out and gone by this time and he had strolled round to return in that direction that he might look in as he passed Had she not seen her brother to night Yes said Lizzie whose manner was a little troubled Gracious condescension on our brother s part mister Eugene Wrayburn thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder Who was his friend with him The schoolmaster To be sure Looked like it Lizzie sat so still that one could not have said wherein the fact of her manner being troubled was expressed and yet one could not have doubted it Eugene was as easy as ever but perhaps as she sat with her eyes cast down it might have been rather more perceptible that his attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments than its concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was elsewhere I have nothing to report Lizzie said Eugene But having promised you that an eye should be always kept on mister Riderhood through my friend Lightwood I like occasionally to renew my assurance that I keep my promise and keep my friend up to the mark I should not have doubted it sir Generally I confess myself a man to be doubted returned Eugene coolly for all that Why are you asked the sharp Miss Wren Because my dear said the airy Eugene I am a bad idle dog Then why don t you reform and be a good dog inquired Miss Wren Because my dear returned Eugene there s nobody who makes it worth my while Have you considered my suggestion Lizzie This in a lower voice but only as if it were a graver matter not at all to the exclusion of the person of the house I have thought of it mister Wrayburn but I have not been able to make up my mind to accept it False pride said Eugene I think not mister Wrayburn I hope not False pride repeated Eugene Why what else is it The thing is worth nothing in itself The thing is worth nothing to me What can it be worth to me You know the most I make of it I propose to be of some use to somebody which I never was in this world and never shall be on any other occasion by paying some qualified person of your own sex and age so many or rather so few contemptible shillings to come here certain nights in the week and give you certain instruction which you wouldn t want if you hadn t been a self denying daughter and sister You know that it s good to have it or you would never have so devoted yourself to your brother s having it Then why not have it especially when our friend Miss Jenny here would profit by it too If I proposed to be the teacher or to attend the lessons obviously incongruous but as to that I might as well be on the other side of the globe or not on the globe at all False pride Lizzie Because true pride wouldn t shame or be shamed by your thankless brother True pride wouldn t have schoolmasters brought here like doctors to look at a bad case True pride would go to work and do it You know that well enough for you know that your own true pride would do it to morrow if you had the ways and means which false pride won t let me supply Very well I add no more than this Your false pride does wrong to yourself and does wrong to your dead father How to my father mister Wrayburn she asked with an anxious face How to your father Can you ask By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy By resolving not to set right the wrong he did you By determining that the deprivation to which he condemned you and which he forced upon you shall always rest upon his head It chanced to be a subtle string to sound in her who had so spoken to her brother within the hour It sounded far more forcibly because of the change in the speaker for the moment the passing appearance of earnestness complete conviction injured resentment of suspicion generous and unselfish interest All these qualities in him usually so light and careless she felt to be inseparable from some touch of their opposites in her own breast She thought had she so far below him and so different rejected this disinterestedness because of some vain misgiving that he sought her out or heeded any personal attractions that he might descry in her The poor girl pure of heart and purpose could not bear to think it Sinking before her own eyes as she suspected herself of it she drooped her head as though she had done him some wicked and grievous injury and broke into silent tears Don t be distressed said Eugene very very kindly I hope it is not I who have distressed you I meant no more than to put the matter in its true light before you though I acknowledge I did it selfishly enough for I am disappointed Disappointed of doing her a service How else COULD he be disappointed It won t break my heart laughed Eugene it won t stay by me eight and forty hours but I am genuinely disappointed I had set my fancy on doing this little thing for you and for our friend Miss Jenny The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful had its charms I see now that I might have managed it better I might have affected to do it wholly for our friend Miss J I might have got myself up morally as Sir Eugene Bountiful But upon my soul I can t make flourishes and I would rather be disappointed than try If he meant to follow home what was in Lizzie s thoughts it was skilfully done If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence it was done by an evil chance It opened out so naturally before me said Eugene The ball seemed so thrown into my hands by accident I happen to be originally brought into contact with you Lizzie on those two occasions that you know of I happen to be able to promise you that a watch shall be kept upon that false accuser Riderhood I happen to be able to give you some little consolation in the darkest hour of your distress by assuring you that I don t believe him On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest and least of lawyers but that I am better than none in a case I have noted down with my own hand and that you may be always sure of my best help and incidentally of Lightwood s too in your efforts to clear your father So it gradually takes my fancy that I may help you so easily to clear your father of that other blame which I mentioned a few minutes ago and which is a just and real one I hope I have explained myself for I am heartily sorry to have distressed you I hate to claim to mean well but I really did mean honestly and simply well and I want you to know it I have never doubted that mister Wrayburn said Lizzie the more repentant the less he claimed I am very glad to hear it Though if you had quite understood my whole meaning at first I think you would not have refused Do you think you would I don t know that I should mister Wrayburn Well Then why refuse now you do understand it It s not easy for me to talk to you returned Lizzie in some confusion for you see all the consequences of what I say as soon as I say it Take all the consequences laughed Eugene and take away my disappointment Lizzie Hexam as I truly respect you and as I am your friend and a poor devil of a gentleman I protest I don t even now understand why you hesitate There was an appearance of openness trustfulness unsuspecting generosity in his words and manner that won the poor girl over and not only won her over but again caused her to feel as though she had been influenced by the opposite qualities with vanity at their head I will not hesitate any longer mister Wrayburn I hope you will not think the worse of me for having hesitated at all For myself and for Jenny you let me answer for you Jenny dear The little creature had been leaning back attentive with her elbows resting on the elbows of her chair and her chin upon her hands Without changing her attitude she answered Yes so suddenly that it rather seemed as if she had chopped the monosyllable than spoken it For myself and for Jenny I thankfully accept your kind offer Agreed Dismissed said Eugene giving Lizzie his hand before lightly waving it as if he waved the whole subject away I hope it may not be often that so much is made of so little Then he fell to talking playfully with Jenny Wren I think of setting up a doll Miss Jenny he said You had better not replied the dressmaker Why not You are sure to break it All you children do But that makes good for trade you know Miss Wren returned Eugene Much as people s breaking promises and contracts and bargains of all sorts makes good for MY trade I don t know about that Miss Wren retorted but you had better by half set up a pen wiper and turn industrious and use it Why if we were all as industrious as you little Busy Body we should begin to work as soon as we could crawl and there would be a bad thing Do you mean returned the little creature with a flush suffusing her face bad for your backs and your legs No no no said Eugene shocked to do him justice at the thought of trifling with her infirmity Bad for business bad for business If we all set to work as soon as we could use our hands it would be all over with the dolls dressmakers There s something in that replied Miss Wren you have a sort of an idea in your noddle sometimes Then in a changed tone Talking of ideas my Lizzie they were sitting side by side as they had sat at first I wonder how it happens that when I am work work working here all alone in the summer time I smell flowers As a commonplace individual I should say Eugene suggested languidly for he was growing weary of the person of the house that you smell flowers because you DO smell flowers No I don t said the little creature resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair resting her chin upon that hand and looking vacantly before her this is not a flowery neighbourhood It s anything but that And yet as I sit at work I smell miles of flowers I smell roses till I think I see the rose leaves lying in heaps bushels on the floor I smell fallen leaves till I put down my hand so and expect to make them rustle I smell the white and the pink May in the hedges and all sorts of flowers that I never was among For I have seen very few flowers indeed in my life Pleasant fancies to have Jenny dear said her friend with a glance towards Eugene as if she would have asked him whether they were given the child in compensation for her losses So I think Lizzie when they come to me And the birds I hear Oh cried the little creature holding out her hand and looking upward how they sing There was something in the face and action for the moment quite inspired and beautiful Then the chin dropped musingly upon the hand again I dare say my birds sing better than other birds and my flowers smell better than other flowers For when I was a little child in a tone as though it were ages ago the children that I used to see early in the morning were very different from any others that I ever saw They were not like me they were not chilled anxious ragged or beaten they were never in pain They were not like the children of the neighbours they never made me tremble all over by setting up shrill noises and they never mocked me Such numbers of them too All in white dresses and with something shining on the borders and on their heads that I have never been able to imitate with my work though I know it so well They used to come down in long bright slanting rows and say all together Who is this in pain Who is this in pain When I told them who it was they answered Come and play with us When I said I never play I can t play they swept about me and took me up and made me light Then it was all delicious ease and rest till they laid me down and said all together Have patience and we will come again Whenever they came back I used to know they were coming before I saw the long bright rows by hearing them ask all together a long way off Who is this in pain Who is this in pain And I used to cry out O my blessed children it s poor me Have pity on me Take me up and make me light By degrees as she progressed in this remembrance the hand was raised the late ecstatic look returned and she became quite beautiful Having so paused for a moment silent with a listening smile upon her face she looked round and recalled herself What poor fun you think me don t you mister Wrayburn You may well look tired of me But it s Saturday night and I won t detain you That is to say Miss Wren observed Eugene quite ready to profit by the hint you wish me to go Well it s Saturday night she returned and my child s coming home And my child is a troublesome bad child and costs me a world of scolding I would rather you didn t see my child A doll said Eugene not understanding and looking for an explanation But Lizzie with her lips only shaping the two words Her father he delayed no longer He took his leave immediately At the corner of the street he stopped to light another cigar and possibly to ask himself what he was doing otherwise If so the answer was indefinite and vague Who knows what he is doing who is careless what he does A man stumbled against him as he turned away who mumbled some maudlin apology Looking after this man Eugene saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out On the man s stumbling into the room Lizzie rose to leave it Don t go away Miss Hexam he said in a submissive manner speaking thickly and with difficulty Don t fly from unfortunate man in shattered state of health Give poor invalid honour of your company It ain t ain t catching Lizzie murmured that she had something to do in her own room and went away upstairs How s my Jenny said the man timidly How s my Jenny Wren best of children object dearest affections broken hearted invalid To which the person of the house stretching out her arm in an attitude of command replied with irresponsive asperity Go along with you Go along into your corner Get into your corner directly The wretched spectacle made as if he would have offered some remonstrance but not venturing to resist the person of the house thought better of it and went and sat down on a particular chair of disgrace Oh h h cried the person of the house pointing her little finger You bad old boy Oh h h you naughty wicked creature WHAT do you mean by it The shaking figure unnerved and disjointed from head to foot put out its two hands a little way as making overtures of peace and reconciliation Abject tears stood in its eyes and stained the blotched red of its cheeks The swollen lead coloured under lip trembled with a shameful whine The whole indecorous threadbare ruin from the broken shoes to the prematurely grey scanty hair grovelled Not with any sense worthy to be called a sense of this dire reversal of the places of parent and child but in a pitiful expostulation to be let off from a scolding I know your tricks and your manners cried Miss Wren I know where you ve been to which indeed it did not require discernment to discover Oh you disgraceful old chap The very breathing of the figure was contemptible as it laboured and rattled in that operation like a blundering clock Slave slave slave from morning to night pursued the person of the house and all for this WHAT do you mean by it There was something in that emphasized What which absurdly frightened the figure As often as the person of the house worked her way round to it even as soon as he saw that it was coming he collapsed in an extra degree I wish you had been taken up and locked up said the person of the house I wish you had been poked into cells and black holes and run over by rats and spiders and beetles I know their tricks and their manners and they d have tickled you nicely Ain t you ashamed of yourself Yes my dear stammered the father Then said the person of the house terrifying him by a grand muster of her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word WHAT do you mean by it Circumstances over which had no control was the miserable creature s plea in extenuation I LL circumstance you and control you too retorted the person of the house speaking with vehement sharpness if you talk in that way I ll give you in charge to the police and have you fined five shillings when you can t pay and then I won t pay the money for you and you ll be transported for life How should you like to be transported for life Shouldn t like it Poor shattered invalid Trouble nobody long cried the wretched figure Come come said the person of the house tapping the table near her in a business like manner and shaking her head and her chin you know what you ve got to do Put down your money this instant The obedient figure began to rummage in its pockets Spent a fortune out of your wages I ll be bound said the person of the house Put it here All you ve got left Every farthing Such a business as he made of collecting it from his dogs eared pockets of expecting it in this pocket and not finding it of not expecting it in that pocket and passing it over of finding no pocket where that other pocket ought to be Is this all demanded the person of the house when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table Got no more was the rueful answer with an accordant shake of the head Let me make sure You know what you ve got to do Turn all your pockets inside out and leave em so cried the person of the house He obeyed And if anything could have made him look more abject or more dismally ridiculous than before it would have been his so displaying himself Here s but seven and eightpence halfpenny exclaimed Miss Wren after reducing the heap to order Oh you prodigal old son Now you shall be starved No don t starve me he urged whimpering If you were treated as you ought to be said Miss Wren you d be fed upon the skewers of cats meat only the skewers after the cats had had the meat As it is go to bed When he stumbled out of the corner to comply he again put out both his hands and pleaded Circumstances over which no control Get along with you to bed cried Miss Wren snapping him up Don t speak to me I m not going to forgive you Go to bed this moment Seeing another emphatic What upon its way he evaded it by complying and was heard to shuffle heavily up stairs and shut his door and throw himself on his bed Within a little while afterwards Lizzie came down Shall we have our supper Jenny dear Ah bless us and save us we need have something to keep us going returned Miss Jenny shrugging her shoulders Lizzie laid a cloth upon the little bench more handy for the person of the house than an ordinary table and put upon it such plain fare as they were accustomed to have and drew up a stool for herself Now for supper What are you thinking of Jenny darling I was thinking she returned coming out of a deep study what I would do to Him if he should turn out a drunkard Oh but he won t said Lizzie You ll take care of that beforehand I shall try to take care of it beforehand but he might deceive me Oh my dear all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do deceive With the little fist in full action And if so I tell you what I think I d do When he was asleep I d make a spoon red hot and I d have some boiling liquor bubbling in a saucepan and I d take it out hissing and I d open his mouth with the other hand or perhaps he d sleep with his mouth ready open and I d pour it down his throat and blister it and choke him I am sure you would do no such horrible thing said Lizzie Shouldn t I Well perhaps I shouldn t But I should like to I am equally sure you would not Not even like to Well you generally know best Only you haven t always lived among it as I have lived and your back isn t bad and your legs are not queer As they went on with their supper Lizzie tried to bring her round to that prettier and better state But the charm was broken The person of the house was the person of a house full of sordid shames and cares with an upper room in which that abased figure was infecting even innocent sleep with sensual brutality and degradation The doll s dressmaker had become a little quaint shrew of the world worldly of the earth earthy Poor doll s dressmaker How often so dragged down by hands that should have raised her up how often so misdirected when losing her way on the eternal road and asking guidance Poor poor little doll s dressmaker Chapter three A PIECE OF WORK Britannia sitting meditating one fine day perhaps in the attitude in which she is presented on the copper coinage discovers all of a sudden that she wants Veneering in Parliament It occurs to her that Veneering is a representative man which cannot in these times be doubted and that Her Majesty s faithful Commons are incomplete without him So Britannia mentions to a legal gentleman of her acquaintance that if Veneering will put down five thousand pounds he may write a couple of initial letters after his name at the extremely cheap rate of two thousand five hundred per letter It is clearly understood between Britannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is to take up the five thousand pounds but that being put down they will disappear by magical conjuration and enchantment The legal gentleman in Britannia s confidence going straight from that lady to Veneering thus commissioned Veneering declares himself highly flattered but requires breathing time to ascertain whether his friends will rally round him Above all things he says it behoves him to be clear at a crisis of this importance whether his friends will rally round him The legal gentleman in the interests of his client cannot allow much time for this purpose as the lady rather thinks she knows somebody prepared to put down six thousand pounds but he says he will give Veneering four hours Veneering then says to missus Veneering We must work and throws himself into a Hansom cab missus Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby to Nurse presses her aquiline hands upon her brow to arrange the throbbing intellect within orders out the carriage and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner compounded of Ophelia and any self immolating female of antiquity you may prefer We must work Veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the Public in the streets like the Life Guards at Waterloo is driven furiously to Duke Street Saint James s There he finds Twemlow in his lodgings fresh from the hands of a secret artist who has been doing something to his hair with yolks of eggs The process requiring that Twemlow shall for two hours after the application allow his hair to stick upright and dry gradually he is in an appropriate state for the receipt of startling intelligence looking equally like the Monument on Fish Street Hill and King Priam on a certain incendiary occasion not wholly unknown as a neat point from the classics My dear Twemlow says Veneering grasping both his hands as the dearest and oldest of my friends Then there can be no more doubt about it in future thinks Twemlow and I AM Are you of opinion that your cousin Lord Snigsworth would give his name as a Member of my Committee I don t go so far as to ask for his lordship I only ask for his name Do you think he would give me his name In sudden low spirits Twemlow replies I don t think he would My political opinions says Veneering not previously aware of having any are identical with those of Lord Snigsworth and perhaps as a matter of public feeling and public principle Lord Snigsworth would give me his name It might be so says Twemlow but And perplexedly scratching his head forgetful of the yolks of eggs is the more discomfited by being reminded how stickey he is Between such old and intimate friends as ourselves pursues Veneering there should in such a case be no reserve Promise me that if I ask you to do anything for me which you don t like to do or feel the slightest difficulty in doing you will freely tell me so This Twemlow is so kind as to promise with every appearance of most heartily intending to keep his word Would you have any objection to write down to Snigsworthy Park and ask this favour of Lord Snigsworth Of course if it were granted I should know that I owed it solely to you while at the same time you would put it to Lord Snigsworth entirely upon public grounds Would you have any objection Says Twemlow with his hand to his forehead You have exacted a promise from me I have my dear Twemlow And you expect me to keep it honourably I do my dear Twemlow ON the whole then observe me urges Twemlow with great nicety as if in the case of its having been off the whole he would have done it directly ON the whole I must beg you to excuse me from addressing any communication to Lord Snigsworth Bless you bless you says Veneering horribly disappointed but grasping him by both hands again in a particularly fervent manner It is not to be wondered at that poor Twemlow should decline to inflict a letter on his noble cousin who has gout in the temper inasmuch as his noble cousin who allows him a small annuity on which he lives takes it out of him as the phrase goes in extreme severity putting him when he visits at Snigsworthy Park under a kind of martial law ordaining that he shall hang his hat on a particular peg sit on a particular chair talk on particular subjects to particular people and perform particular exercises such as sounding the praises of the Family Varnish not to say Pictures and abstaining from the choicest of the Family Wines unless expressly invited to partake One thing however I CAN do for you says Twemlow and that is work for you Veneering blesses him again I ll go says Twemlow in a rising hurry of spirits to the club let us see now what o clock is it Twenty minutes to eleven I ll be says Twemlow at the club by ten minutes to twelve and I ll never leave it all day Veneering feels that his friends are rallying round him and says Thank you thank you I knew I could rely upon you I said to Anastatia before leaving home just now to come to you of course the first friend I have seen on a subject so momentous to me my dear Twemlow I said to Anastatia We must work You were right you were right replies Twemlow Tell me Is SHE working She is says Veneering Good cries Twemlow polite little gentleman that he is A woman s tact is invaluable To have the dear sex with us is to have everything with us But you have not imparted to me remarks Veneering what you think of my entering the House of Commons I think rejoins Twemlow feelingly that it is the best club in London Veneering again blesses him plunges down stairs rushes into his Hansom and directs the driver to be up and at the British Public and to charge into the City Meanwhile Twemlow in an increasing hurry of spirits gets his hair down as well as he can which is not very well for after these glutinous applications it is restive and has a surface on it somewhat in the nature of pastry and gets to the club by the appointed time At the club he promptly secures a large window writing materials and all the newspapers and establishes himself immoveable to be respectfully contemplated by Pall Mall Sometimes when a man enters who nods to him Twemlow says Do you know Veneering Man says No member of the club Twemlow says Yes Coming in for Pocket Breaches Man says Ah Hope he may find it worth the money yawns and saunters out Towards six o clock of the afternoon Twemlow begins to persuade himself that he is positively jaded with work and thinks it much to be regretted that he was not brought up as a Parliamentary agent From Twemlow s Veneering dashes at Podsnap s place of business Finds Podsnap reading the paper standing and inclined to be oratorical over the astonishing discovery he has made that Italy is not England Respectfully entreats Podsnap s pardon for stopping the flow of his words of wisdom and informs him what is in the wind Tells Podsnap that their political opinions are identical Gives Podsnap to understand that he Veneering formed his political opinions while sitting at the feet of him Podsnap Seeks earnestly to know whether Podsnap will rally round him Says Podsnap something sternly Now first of all Veneering do you ask my advice Veneering falters that as so old and so dear a friend Yes yes that s all very well says Podsnap but have you made up your mind to take this borough of Pocket Breaches on its own terms or do you ask my opinion whether you shall take it or leave it alone Veneering repeats that his heart s desire and his soul s thirst are that Podsnap shall rally round him Now I ll be plain with you Veneering says Podsnap knitting his brows You will infer that I don t care about Parliament from the fact of my not being there Why of course Veneering knows that Of course Veneering knows that if Podsnap chose to go there he would be there in a space of time that might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy It is not worth my while pursues Podsnap becoming handsomely mollified and it is the reverse of important to my position But it is not my wish to set myself up as law for another man differently situated You think it IS worth YOUR while and IS important to YOUR position Is that so Always with the proviso that Podsnap will rally round him Veneering thinks it is so Then you don t ask my advice says Podsnap Good Then I won t give it you But you do ask my help Good Then I ll work for you Veneering instantly blesses him and apprises him that Twemlow is already working Podsnap does not quite approve that anybody should be already working regarding it rather in the light of a liberty but tolerates Twemlow and says he is a well connected old female who will do no harm I have nothing very particular to do to day adds Podsnap and I ll mix with some influential people I had engaged myself to dinner but I ll send missus Podsnap and get off going myself and I ll dine with you at eight It s important we should report progress and compare notes Now let me see You ought to have a couple of active energetic fellows of gentlemanly manners to go about Veneering after cogitation thinks of Boots and Brewer Whom I have met at your house says Podsnap Yes They ll do very well Let them each have a cab and go about Veneering immediately mentions what a blessing he feels it to possess a friend capable of such grand administrative suggestions and really is elated at this going about of Boots and Brewer as an idea wearing an electioneering aspect and looking desperately like business Leaving Podsnap at a hand gallop he descends upon Boots and Brewer who enthusiastically rally round him by at once bolting off in cabs taking opposite directions Then Veneering repairs to the legal gentleman in Britannia s confidence and with him transacts some delicate affairs of business and issues an address to the independent electors of Pocket Breaches announcing that he is coming among them for their suffrages as the mariner returns to the home of his early childhood a phrase which is none the worse for his never having been near the place in his life and not even now distinctly knowing where it is missus Veneering during the same eventful hours is not idle No sooner does the carriage turn out all complete than she turns into it all complete and gives the word To Lady Tippins s That charmer dwells over a staymaker s in the Belgravian Borders with a life size model in the window on the ground floor of a distinguished beauty in a blue petticoat stay lace in hand looking over her shoulder at the town in innocent surprise As well she may to find herself dressing under the circumstances Lady Tippins at home Lady Tippins at home with the room darkened and her back like the lady s at the ground floor window though for a different reason cunningly turned towards the light Lady Tippins is so surprised by seeing her dear missus Veneering so early in the middle of the night the pretty creature calls it that her eyelids almost go up under the influence of that emotion To whom missus Veneering incoherently communicates how that Veneering has been offered Pocket Breaches how that it is the time for rallying round how that Veneering has said We must work how that she is here as a wife and mother to entreat Lady Tippins to work how that the carriage is at Lady Tippins s disposal for purposes of work how that she proprietress of said bran new elegant equipage will return home on foot on bleeding feet if need be to work not specifying how until she drops by the side of baby s crib My love says Lady Tippins compose yourself we ll bring him in And Lady Tippins really does work and work the Veneering horses too for she clatters about town all day calling upon everybody she knows and showing her entertaining powers and green fan to immense advantage by rattling on with My dear soul what do you think What do you suppose me to be You ll never guess I m pretending to be an electioneering agent And for what place of all places Pocket Breaches And why Because the dearest friend I have in the world has bought it And who is the dearest friend I have in the world A man of the name of Veneering Not omitting his wife who is the other dearest friend I have in the world and I positively declare I forgot their baby who is the other And we are carrying on this little farce to keep up appearances and isn t it refreshing Then my precious child the fun of it is that nobody knows who these Veneerings are and that they know nobody and that they have a house out of the Tales of the Genii and give dinners out of the Arabian Nights Curious to see em my dear Say you ll know em Come and dine with em They shan t bore you Say who shall meet you We ll make up a party of our own and I ll engage that they shall not interfere with you for one single moment You really ought to see their gold and silver camels I call their dinner table the Caravan Do come and dine with my Veneerings my own Veneerings my exclusive property the dearest friends I have in the world And above all my dear be sure you promise me your vote and interest and all sorts of plumpers for Pocket Breaches for we couldn t think of spending sixpence on it my love and can only consent to be brought in by the spontaneous thingummies of the incorruptible whatdoyoucallums Now the point of view seized by the bewitching Tippins that this same working and rallying round is to keep up appearances may have something in it but not all the truth More is done or considered to be done which does as well by taking cabs and going about than the fair Tippins knew of Many vast vague reputations have been made solely by taking cabs and going about This particularly obtains in all Parliamentary affairs Whether the business in hand be to get a man in or get a man out or get a man over or promote a railway or jockey a railway or what else nothing is understood to be so effectual as scouring nowhere in a violent hurry in short as taking cabs and going about Probably because this reason is in the air Twemlow far from being singular in his persuasion that he works like a Trojan is capped by Podsnap who in his turn is capped by Boots and Brewer At eight o clock when all these hard workers assemble to dine at Veneering s it is understood that the cabs of Boots and Brewer mustn t leave the door but that pails of water must be brought from the nearest baiting place and cast over the horses legs on the very spot lest Boots and Brewer should have instant occasion to mount and away Those fleet messengers require the Analytical to see that their hats are deposited where they can be laid hold of at an instant s notice and they dine remarkably well though with the air of firemen in charge of an engine expecting intelligence of some tremendous conflagration missus Veneering faintly remarks as dinner opens that many such days would be too much for her Many such days would be too much for all of us says Podsnap but we ll bring him in We ll bring him in says Lady Tippins sportively waving her green fan Veneering for ever We ll bring him in says Twemlow We ll bring him in say Boots and Brewer Strictly speaking it would be hard to show cause why they should not bring him in Pocket Breaches having closed its little bargain and there being no opposition However it is agreed that they must work to the last and that if they did not work something indefinite would happen It is likewise agreed that they are all so exhausted with the work behind them and need to be so fortified for the work before them as to require peculiar strengthening from Veneering s cellar Therefore the Analytical has orders to produce the cream of the cream of his binns and therefore it falls out that rallying becomes rather a trying word for the occasion Lady Tippins being observed gamely to inculcate the necessity of rearing round their dear Veneering Podsnap advocating roaring round him Boots and Brewer declaring their intention of reeling round him and Veneering thanking his devoted friends one and all with great emotion for rarullarulling round him In these inspiring moments Brewer strikes out an idea which is the great hit of the day He consults his watch and says like Guy Fawkes he ll now go down to the House of Commons and see how things look I ll keep about the lobby for an hour or so says Brewer with a deeply mysterious countenance and if things look well I won t come back but will order my cab for nine in the morning You couldn t do better says Podsnap Veneering expresses his inability ever to acknowledge this last service Tears stand in missus Veneering s affectionate eyes Boots shows envy loses ground and is regarded as possessing a second rate mind They all crowd to the door to see Brewer off Brewer says to his driver Now is your horse pretty fresh eyeing the animal with critical scrutiny Driver says he s as fresh as butter Put him along then says Brewer House of Commons Driver darts up Brewer leaps in they cheer him as he departs and mister Podsnap says Mark my words sir That s a man of resource that s a man to make his way in life When the time comes for Veneering to deliver a neat and appropriate stammer to the men of Pocket Breaches only Podsnap and Twemlow accompany him by railway to that sequestered spot The legal gentleman is at the Pocket Breaches Branch Station with an open carriage with a printed bill Veneering for ever stuck upon it as if it were a wall and they gloriously proceed amidst the grins of the populace to a feeble little town hall on crutches with some onions and bootlaces under it which the legal gentleman says are a Market and from the front window of that edifice Veneering speaks to the listening earth In the moment of his taking his hat off Podsnap as per agreement made with missus Veneering telegraphs to that wife and mother He s up Veneering loses his way in the usual No Thoroughfares of speech and Podsnap and Twemlow say Hear hear and sometimes when he can t by any means back himself out of some very unlucky No Thoroughfare He a a r He a a r with an air of facetious conviction as if the ingenuity of the thing gave them a sensation of exquisite pleasure But Veneering makes two remarkably good points so good that they are supposed to have been suggested to him by the legal gentleman in Britannia s confidence while briefly conferring on the stairs Point the first is this Veneering institutes an original comparison between the country and a ship pointedly calling the ship the Vessel of the State and the Minister the Man at the Helm Veneering s object is to let Pocket Breaches know that his friend on his right Podsnap is a man of wealth Consequently says he And gentlemen when the timbers of the Vessel of the State are unsound and the Man at the Helm is unskilful would those great Marine Insurers who rank among our world famed merchant princes would they insure her gentlemen Would they underwrite her Would they incur a risk in her Would they have confidence in her Why gentlemen if I appealed to my honourable friend upon my right himself among the greatest and most respected of that great and much respected class he would answer No Point the second is this The telling fact that Twemlow is related to Lord Snigsworth must be let off Veneering supposes a state of public affairs that probably never could by any possibility exist though this is not quite certain in consequence of his picture being unintelligible to himself and everybody else and thus proceeds Why gentlemen if I were to indicate such a programme to any class of society I say it would be received with derision would be pointed at by the finger of scorn If I indicated such a programme to any worthy and intelligent tradesman of your town nay I will here be personal and say Our town what would he reply He would reply Away with it That s what HE would reply gentlemen In his honest indignation he would reply Away with it But suppose I mounted higher in the social scale Suppose I drew my arm through the arm of my respected friend upon my left and walking with him through the ancestral woods of his family and under the spreading beeches of Snigsworthy Park approached the noble hall crossed the courtyard entered by the door went up the staircase and passing from room to room found myself at last in the august presence of my friend s near kinsman Lord Snigsworth And suppose I said to that venerable earl My Lord I am here before your lordship presented by your lordship s near kinsman my friend upon my left to indicate that programme what would his lordship answer Why he would answer Away with it That s what he would answer gentlemen Away with it Unconsciously using in his exalted sphere the exact language of the worthy and intelligent tradesman of our town the near and dear kinsman of my friend upon my left would answer in his wrath Away with it Veneering finishes with this last success and mister Podsnap telegraphs to missus Veneering He s down Then dinner is had at the Hotel with the legal gentleman and then there are in due succession nomination and declaration Finally mister Podsnap telegraphs to missus Veneering We have brought him in Another gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering halls and Lady Tippins awaits them and Boots and Brewer await them There is a modest assertion on everybody s part that everybody single handed brought him in but in the main it is conceded by all that that stroke of business on Brewer s part in going down to the house that night to see how things looked was the master stroke A touching little incident is related by missus Veneering in the course of the evening missus Veneering is habitually disposed to be tearful and has an extra disposition that way after her late excitement Previous to withdrawing from the dinner table with Lady Tippins she says in a pathetic and physically weak manner You will all think it foolish of me I know but I must mention it As I sat by Baby s crib on the night before the election Baby was very uneasy in her sleep The Analytical chemist who is gloomily looking on has diabolical impulses to suggest Wind and throw up his situation but represses them After an interval almost convulsive Baby curled her little hands in one another and smiled missus Veneering stopping here mister Podsnap deems it incumbent on him to say I wonder why Could it be I asked myself says missus Veneering looking about her for her pocket handkerchief that the Fairies were telling Baby that her papa would shortly be an M P So overcome by the sentiment is missus Veneering that they all get up to make a clear stage for Veneering who goes round the table to the rescue and bears her out backward with her feet impressively scraping the carpet after remarking that her work has been too much for her strength Whether the fairies made any mention of the five thousand pounds and it disagreed with Baby is not speculated upon Poor little Twemlow quite done up is touched and still continues touched after he is safely housed over the livery stable yard in Duke Street Saint James s But there upon his sofa a tremendous consideration breaks in upon the mild gentleman putting all softer considerations to the rout Gracious heavens Now I have time to think of it he never saw one of his constituents in all his days until we saw them together After having paced the room in distress of mind with his hand to his forehead the innocent Twemlow returns to his sofa and moans I shall either go distracted or die of this man He comes upon me too late in life I am not strong enough to bear him Chapter four CUPID PROMPTED To use the cold language of the world missus Alfred Lammle rapidly improved the acquaintance of Miss Podsnap To use the warm language of missus Lammle she and her sweet Georgiana soon became one in heart in mind in sentiment in soul Whenever Georgiana could escape from the thraldom of Podsnappery could throw off the bedclothes of the custard coloured phaeton and get up could shrink out of the range of her mother s rocking and so to speak rescue her poor little frosty toes from being rocked over she repaired to her friend missus Alfred Lammle missus Podsnap by no means objected As a consciously splendid woman accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society missus Podsnap could dispense with her daughter mister Podsnap for his part on being informed where Georgiana was swelled with patronage of the Lammles That they when unable to lay hold of him should respectfully grasp at the hem of his mantle that they when they could not bask in the glory of him the sun should take up with the pale reflected light of the watery young moon his daughter appeared quite natural becoming and proper It gave him a better opinion of the discretion of the Lammles than he had heretofore held as showing that they appreciated the value of the connexion So Georgiana repairing to her friend mister Podsnap went out to dinner and to dinner and yet to dinner arm in arm with missus Podsnap settling his obstinate head in his cravat and shirt collar much as if he were performing on the Pandean pipes in his own honour the triumphal march See the conquering Podsnap comes Sound the trumpets beat the drums It was a trait in mister Podsnap s character and in one form or other it will be generally seen to pervade the depths and shallows of Podsnappery that he could not endure a hint of disparagement of any friend or acquaintance of his How dare you he would seem to say in such a case What do you mean I have licensed this person This person has taken out MY certificate Through this person you strike at me Podsnap the Great And it is not that I particularly care for the person s dignity but that I do most particularly care for Podsnap s Hence if any one in his presence had presumed to doubt the responsibility of the Lammles he would have been mightily huffed Not that any one did for Veneering M P was always the authority for their being very rich and perhaps believed it As indeed he might if he chose for anything he knew of the matter mister and missus Lammle s house in Sackville Street Piccadilly was but a temporary residence It has done well enough they informed their friends for mister Lammle when a bachelor but it would not do now So they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations and always very nearly taking or buying one but never quite concluding the bargain Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation apart People said on seeing a vacant palatial residence The very thing for the Lammles and wrote to the Lammles about it and the Lammles always went to look at it but unfortunately it never exactly answered In short they suffered so many disappointments that they began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence And hereby they made another shining reputation many persons of their acquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with their own houses and envious of the non existent Lammle structure The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street were piled thick and high over the skeleton up stairs and if it ever whispered from under its load of upholstery Here I am in the closet it was to very few ears and certainly never to Miss Podsnap s What Miss Podsnap was particularly charmed with next to the graces of her friend was the happiness of her friend s married life This was frequently their theme of conversation I am sure said Miss Podsnap mister Lammle is like a lover At least I I should think he was Georgiana darling said missus Lammle holding up a forefinger Take care Oh my goodness me exclaimed Miss Podsnap reddening What have I said now Alfred you know hinted missus Lammle playfully shaking her head You were never to say mister Lammle any more Georgiana Oh Alfred then I am glad it s no worse I was afraid I had said something shocking I am always saying something wrong to ma To me Georgiana dearest No not to you you are not ma I wish you were missus Lammle bestowed a sweet and loving smile upon her friend which Miss Podsnap returned as she best could They sat at lunch in missus Lammle s own boudoir And so dearest Georgiana Alfred is like your notion of a lover I don t say that Sophronia Georgiana replied beginning to conceal her elbows I haven t any notion of a lover The dreadful wretches that ma brings up at places to torment me are not lovers I only mean that mister Again dearest Georgiana That Alfred Sounds much better darling Loves you so He always treats you with such delicate gallantry and attention Now don t he Truly my dear said missus Lammle with a rather singular expression crossing her face I believe that he loves me fully as much as I love him Oh what happiness exclaimed Miss Podsnap But do you know my Georgiana missus Lammle resumed presently that there is something suspicious in your enthusiastic sympathy with Alfred s tenderness Good gracious no I hope not Doesn t it rather suggest said missus Lammle archly that my Georgiana s little heart is Oh don t Miss Podsnap blushingly besought her Please don t I assure you Sophronia that I only praise Alfred because he is your husband and so fond of you Sophronia s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her It shaded off into a cool smile as she said with her eyes upon her lunch and her eyebrows raised You are quite wrong my love in your guess at my meaning What I insinuated was that my Georgiana s little heart was growing conscious of a vacancy No no no said Georgiana I wouldn t have anybody say anything to me in that way for I don t know how many thousand pounds In what way my Georgiana inquired missus Lammle still smiling coolly with her eyes upon her lunch and her eyebrows raised YOU know returned poor little Miss Podsnap I think I should go out of my mind Sophronia with vexation and shyness and detestation if anybody did It s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are That s a different thing I couldn t bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself I should beg and pray to to have the person taken away and trampled upon Ah here was Alfred Having stolen in unobserved he playfully leaned on the back of Sophronia s chair and as Miss Podsnap saw him put one of Sophronia s wandering locks to his lips and waved a kiss from it towards Miss Podsnap What is this about husbands and detestations inquired the captivating Alfred Why they say returned his wife that listeners never hear any good of themselves though you but pray how long have you been here sir This instant arrived my own Then I may go on though if you had been here but a moment or two sooner you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana Only if they were to be called praises at all which I really don t think they were explained Miss Podsnap in a flutter for being so devoted to Sophronia Sophronia murmured Alfred My life and kissed her hand In return for which she kissed his watch chain But it was not I who was to be taken away and trampled upon I hope said Alfred drawing a seat between them Ask Georgiana my soul replied his wife Alfred touchingly appealed to Georgiana Oh it was nobody replied Miss Podsnap It was nonsense But if you are determined to know mister Inquisitive Pet as I suppose you are said the happy and fond Sophronia smiling it was any one who should venture to aspire to Georgiana Sophronia my love remonstrated mister Lammle becoming graver you are not serious Alfred my love returned his wife I dare say Georgiana was not but I am Now this said mister Lammle shows the accidental combinations that there are in things Could you believe my Ownest that I came in here with the name of an aspirant to our Georgiana on my lips Of course I could believe Alfred said missus Lammle anything that YOU told me You dear one And I anything that YOU told me How delightful those interchanges and the looks accompanying them Now if the skeleton up stairs had taken that opportunity for instance of calling out Here I am suffocating in the closet I give you my honour my dear Sophronia And I know what that is love said she You do my darling that I came into the room all but uttering young Fledgeby s name Tell Georgiana dearest about young Fledgeby Oh no don t Please don t cried Miss Podsnap putting her fingers in her ears I d rather not missus Lammle laughed in her gayest manner and removing her Georgiana s unresisting hands and playfully holding them in her own at arms length sometimes near together and sometimes wide apart went on You must know you dearly beloved little goose that once upon a time there was a certain person called young Fledgeby And this young Fledgeby who was of an excellent family and rich was known to two other certain persons dearly attached to one another and called mister and missus Alfred Lammle So this young Fledgeby being one night at the play there sees with mister and missus Alfred Lammle a certain heroine called No don t say Georgiana Podsnap pleaded that young lady almost in tears Please don t Oh do do do say somebody else Not Georgiana Podsnap Oh don t don t don t No other said missus Lammle laughing airily and full of affectionate blandishments opening and closing Georgiana s arms like a pair of compasses than my little Georgiana Podsnap So this young Fledgeby goes to that Alfred Lammle and says Oh ple e e ease don t Georgiana as if the supplication were being squeezed out of her by powerful compression I so hate him for saying it For saying what my dear laughed missus Lammle Oh I don t know what he said cried Georgiana wildly but I hate him all the same for saying it My dear said missus Lammle always laughing in her most captivating way the poor young fellow only says that he is stricken all of a heap Oh what shall I ever do interposed Georgiana Oh my goodness what a Fool he must be And implores to be asked to dinner and to make a fourth at the play another time And so he dines to morrow and goes to the Opera with us That s all Except my dear Georgiana and what will you think of this that he is infinitely shyer than you and far more afraid of you than you ever were of any one in all your days In perturbation of mind Miss Podsnap still fumed and plucked at her hands a little but could not help laughing at the notion of anybody s being afraid of her With that advantage Sophronia flattered her and rallied her more successfully and then the insinuating Alfred flattered her and rallied her and promised that at any moment when she might require that service at his hands he would take young Fledgeby out and trample on him Thus it remained amicably understood that young Fledgeby was to come to admire and that Georgiana was to come to be admired and Georgiana with the entirely new sensation in her breast of having that prospect before her and with many kisses from her dear Sophronia in present possession preceded six feet one of discontented footman an amount of the article that always came for her when she walked home to her father s dwelling The happy pair being left together missus Lammle said to her husband If I understand this girl sir your dangerous fascinations have produced some effect upon her I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity There was a mirror on the wall before them and her eyes just caught him smirking in it She gave the reflected image a look of the deepest disdain and the image received it in the glass Next moment they quietly eyed each other as if they the principals had had no part in that expressive transaction It may have been that missus Lammle tried in some manner to excuse her conduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom she spoke with acrimonious contempt It may have been too that in this she did not quite succeed for it is very difficult to resist confidence and she knew she had Georgiana s Nothing more was said between the happy pair Perhaps conspirators who have once established an understanding may not be over fond of repeating the terms and objects of their conspiracy Next day came came Georgiana and came Fledgeby Georgiana had by this time seen a good deal of the house and its frequenters As there was a certain handsome room with a billiard table in it on the ground floor eating out a backyard which might have been mister Lammle s office or library but was called by neither name but simply mister Lammle s room so it would have been hard for stronger female heads than Georgiana s to determine whether its frequenters were men of pleasure or men of business Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance Both were too gaudy too slangey too odorous of cigars and too much given to horseflesh the latter characteristic being exemplified in the room by its decorations and in the men by their conversation High stepping horses seemed necessary to all mister Lammle s friends as necessary as their transaction of business together in a gipsy way at untimely hours of the morning and evening and in rushes and snatches There were friends who seemed to be always coming and going across the Channel on errands about the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths There were other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City on questions of the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths They were all feverish boastful and indefinably loose and they all ate and drank a great deal and made bets in eating and drinking They all spoke of sums of money and only mentioned the sums and left the money to be understood as five and forty thousand Tom or Two hundred and twenty two on every individual share in the lot Joe They seemed to divide the world into two classes of people people who were making enormous fortunes and people who were being enormously ruined They were always in a hurry and yet seemed to have nothing tangible to do except a few of them these mostly asthmatic and thick lipped who were for ever demonstrating to the rest with gold pencil cases which they could hardly hold because of the big rings on their forefingers how money was to be made Lastly they all swore at their grooms and the grooms were not quite as respectful or complete as other men s grooms seeming somehow to fall short of the groom point as their masters fell short of the gentleman point Young Fledgeby was none of these Young Fledgeby had a peachy cheek or a cheek compounded of the peach and the red red red wall on which it grows and was an awkward sandy haired small eyed youth exceeding slim his enemies would have said lanky and prone to self examination in the articles of whisker and moustache While feeling for the whisker that he anxiously expected Fledgeby underwent remarkable fluctuations of spirits ranging along the whole scale from confidence to despair There were times when he started as exclaiming By Jupiter here it is at last There were other times when being equally depressed he would be seen to shake his head and give up hope To see him at those periods leaning on a chimneypiece like as on an urn containing the ashes of his ambition with the cheek that would not sprout upon the hand on which that cheek had forced conviction was a distressing sight Not so was Fledgeby seen on this occasion Arrayed in superb raiment with his opera hat under his arm he concluded his self examination hopefully awaited the arrival of Miss Podsnap and talked small talk with missus Lammle In facetious homage to the smallness of his talk and the jerky nature of his manners Fledgeby s familiars had agreed to confer upon him behind his back the honorary title of Fascination Fledgeby Warm weather missus Lammle said Fascination Fledgeby missus Lammle thought it scarcely as warm as it had been yesterday Perhaps not said Fascination Fledgeby with great quickness of repartee but I expect it will be devilish warm to morrow He threw off another little scintillation Been out to day missus Lammle missus Lammle answered for a short drive Some people said Fascination Fledgeby are accustomed to take long drives but it generally appears to me that if they make em too long they overdo it Being in such feather he might have surpassed himself in his next sally had not Miss Podsnap been announced missus Lammle flew to embrace her darling little Georgy and when the first transports were over presented mister Fledgeby mister Lammle came on the scene last for he was always late and so were the frequenters always late all hands being bound to be made late by private information about the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths A handsome little dinner was served immediately and mister Lammle sat sparkling at his end of the table with his servant behind his chair and HIS ever lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind himself mister Lammle s utmost powers of sparkling were in requisition to day for Fascination Fledgeby and Georgiana not only struck each other speechless but struck each other into astonishing attitudes Georgiana as she sat facing Fledgeby making such efforts to conceal her elbows as were totally incompatible with the use of a knife and fork and Fledgeby as he sat facing Georgiana avoiding her countenance by every possible device and betraying the discomposure of his mind in feeling for his whiskers with his spoon his wine glass and his bread So mister and missus Alfred Lammle had to prompt and this is how they prompted Georgiana said mister Lammle low and smiling and sparkling all over like a harlequin you are not in your usual spirits Why are you not in your usual spirits Georgiana Georgiana faltered that she was much the same as she was in general she was not aware of being different Not aware of being different retorted mister Alfred Lammle You my dear Georgiana Who are always so natural and unconstrained with us Who are such a relief from the crowd that are all alike Who are the embodiment of gentleness simplicity and reality Miss Podsnap looked at the door as if she entertained confused thoughts of taking refuge from these compliments in flight Now I will be judged said mister Lammle raising his voice a little by my friend Fledgeby Oh DON T Miss Podsnap faintly ejaculated when missus Lammle took the prompt book I beg your pardon Alfred my dear but I cannot part with mister Fledgeby quite yet you must wait for him a moment mister Fledgeby and I are engaged in a personal discussion Fledgeby must have conducted it on his side with immense art for no appearance of uttering one syllable had escaped him A personal discussion Sophronia my love What discussion Fledgeby I am jealous What discussion Fledgeby Shall I tell him mister Fledgeby asked missus Lammle Trying to look as if he knew anything about it Fascination replied Yes tell him We were discussing then said missus Lammle if you MUST know Alfred whether mister Fledgeby was in his usual flow of spirits Why that is the very point Sophronia that Georgiana and I were discussing as to herself What did Fledgeby say Oh a likely thing sir that I am going to tell you everything and be told nothing What did Georgiana say Georgiana said she was doing her usual justice to herself to day and I said she was not Precisely exclaimed missus Lammle what I said to mister Fledgeby Still it wouldn t do They would not look at one another No not even when the sparkling host proposed that the quartette should take an appropriately sparkling glass of wine Georgiana looked from her wine glass at mister Lammle and at missus Lammle but mightn t couldn t shouldn t wouldn t look at mister Fledgeby Fascination looked from his wine glass at missus Lammle and at mister Lammle but mightn t couldn t shouldn t wouldn t look at Georgiana More prompting was necessary Cupid must be brought up to the mark The manager had put him down in the bill for the part and he must play it Sophronia my dear said mister Lammle I don t like the colour of your dress I appeal said missus Lammle to mister Fledgeby And I said mister Lammle to Georgiana Georgy my love remarked missus Lammle aside to her dear girl I rely upon you not to go over to the opposition Now mister Fledgeby Fascination wished to know if the colour were not called rose colour Yes said mister Lammle actually he knew everything it was really rose colour Fascination took rose colour to mean the colour of roses In this he was very warmly supported by mister and missus Lammle Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose Similarly it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses Very happy Fledgeby from mister Lammle Notwithstanding Fascination s opinion was that we all had our eyes or at least a large majority of us and that and and his farther opinion was several ands with nothing beyond them Oh mister Fledgeby said missus Lammle to desert me in that way Oh mister Fledgeby to abandon my poor dear injured rose and declare for blue Victory victory cried mister Lammle your dress is condemned my dear But what said missus Lammle stealing her affectionate hand towards her dear girl s what does Georgy say She says replied mister Lammle interpreting for her that in her eyes you look well in any colour Sophronia and that if she had expected to be embarrassed by so pretty a compliment as she has received she would have worn another colour herself Though I tell her in reply that it would not have saved her for whatever colour she had worn would have been Fledgeby s colour But what does Fledgeby say He says replied missus Lammle interpreting for him and patting the back of her dear girl s hand as if it were Fledgeby who was patting it that it was no compliment but a little natural act of homage that he couldn t resist And expressing more feeling as if it were more feeling on the part of Fledgeby he is right he is right Still no not even now would they look at one another Seeming to gnash his sparkling teeth studs eyes and buttons all at once mister Lammle secretly bent a dark frown on the two expressive of an intense desire to bring them together by knocking their heads together Have you heard this opera of to night Fledgeby he asked stopping very short to prevent himself from running on into confound you Why no not exactly said Fledgeby In fact I don t know a note of it Neither do you know it Georgy said missus Lammle N no replied Georgiana faintly under the sympathetic coincidence Why then said missus Lammle charmed by the discovery which flowed from the premises you neither of you know it How charming Even the craven Fledgeby felt that the time was now come when he must strike a blow He struck it by saying partly to missus Lammle and partly to the circumambient air I consider myself very fortunate in being reserved by As he stopped dead mister Lammle making that gingerous bush of his whiskers to look out of offered him the word Destiny No I wasn t going to say that said Fledgeby I was going to say Fate I consider it very fortunate that Fate has written in the book of in the book which is its own property that I should go to that opera for the first time under the memorable circumstances of going with Miss Podsnap To which Georgiana replied hooking her two little fingers in one another and addressing the tablecloth Thank you but I generally go with no one but you Sophronia and I like that very much Content perforce with this success for the time mister Lammle let Miss Podsnap out of the room as if he were opening her cage door and missus Lammle followed Coffee being presently served up stairs he kept a watch on Fledgeby until Miss Podsnap s cup was empty and then directed him with his finger as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever to go and fetch it This feat he performed not only without failure but even with the original embellishment of informing Miss Podsnap that green tea was considered bad for the nerves Though there Miss Podsnap unintentionally threw him out by faltering Oh is it indeed How does it act Which he was not prepared to elucidate The carriage announced missus Lammle said Don t mind me mister Fledgeby my skirts and cloak occupy both my hands take Miss Podsnap And he took her and missus Lammle went next and mister Lammle went last savagely following his little flock like a drover But he was all sparkle and glitter in the box at the Opera and there he and his dear wife made a conversation between Fledgeby and Georgiana in the following ingenious and skilful manner They sat in this order missus Lammle Fascination Fledgeby Georgiana mister Lammle missus Lammle made leading remarks to Fledgeby only requiring monosyllabic replies mister Lammle did the like with Georgiana At times missus Lammle would lean forward to address mister Lammle to this purpose Alfred my dear mister Fledgeby very justly says apropos of the last scene that true constancy would not require any such stimulant as the stage deems necessary To which mister Lammle would reply Ay Sophronia my love but as Georgiana has observed to me the lady had no sufficient reason to know the state of the gentleman s affections To which missus Lammle would rejoin Very true Alfred but mister Fledgeby points out this To which Alfred would demur Undoubtedly Sophronia but Georgiana acutely remarks that Through this device the two young people conversed at great length and committed themselves to a variety of delicate sentiments without having once opened their lips save to say yes or no and even that not to one another Fledgeby took his leave of Miss Podsnap at the carriage door and the Lammles dropped her at her own home and on the way missus Lammle archly rallied her in her fond and protecting manner by saying at intervals Oh little Georgiana little Georgiana Which was not much but the tone added You have enslaved your Fledgeby And thus the Lammles got home at last and the lady sat down moody and weary looking at her dark lord engaged in a deed of violence with a bottle of soda water as though he were wringing the neck of some unlucky creature and pouring its blood down his throat As he wiped his dripping whiskers in an ogreish way he met her eyes and pausing said with no very gentle voice Well Was such an absolute Booby necessary to the purpose I know what I am doing He is no such dolt as you suppose A genius perhaps You sneer perhaps and you take a lofty air upon yourself perhaps But I tell you this when that young fellow s interest is concerned he holds as tight as a horse leech When money is in question with that young fellow he is a match for the Devil Is he a match for you He is Almost as good a one as you thought me for you He has no quality of youth in him but such as you have seen to day Touch him upon money and you touch no booby then He really is a dolt I suppose in other things but it answers his one purpose very well Has she money in her own right in any case Ay she has money in her own right in any case You have done so well to day Sophronia that I answer the question though you know I object to any such questions You have done so well to day Sophronia that you must be tired Get to bed Chapter five MERCURY PROMPTING Fledgeby deserved mister Alfred Lammle s eulogium He was the meanest cur existing with a single pair of legs And instinct a word we all clearly understand going largely on four legs and reason always on two meanness on four legs never attains the perfection of meanness on two The father of this young gentleman had been a money lender who had transacted professional business with the mother of this young gentleman when he the latter was waiting in the vast dark ante chambers of the present world to be born The lady a widow being unable to pay the money lender married him and in due course Fledgeby was summoned out of the vast dark ante chambers to come and be presented to the Registrar General Rather a curious speculation how Fledgeby would otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday Fledgeby s mother offended her family by marrying Fledgeby s father It is one of the easiest achievements in life to offend your family when your family want to get rid of you Fledgeby s mother s family had been very much offended with her for being poor and broke with her for becoming comparatively rich Fledgeby s mother s family was the Snigsworth family She had even the high honour to be cousin to Lord Snigsworth so many times removed that the noble Earl would have had no compunction in removing her one time more and dropping her clean outside the cousinly pale but cousin for all that Among her pre matrimonial transactions with Fledgeby s father Fledgeby s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest The reversion falling in soon after they were married Fledgeby s father laid hold of the cash for his separate use and benefit This led to subjective differences of opinion not to say objective interchanges of boot jacks backgammon boards and other such domestic missiles between Fledgeby s father and Fledgeby s mother and those led to Fledgeby s mother spending as much money as she could and to Fledgeby s father doing all he couldn t to restrain her Fledgeby s childhood had been in consequence a stormy one but the winds and the waves had gone down in the grave and Fledgeby flourished alone He lived in chambers in the Albany did Fledgeby and maintained a spruce appearance But his youthful fire was all composed of sparks from the grindstone and as the sparks flew off went out and never warmed anything be sure that Fledgeby had his tools at the grindstone and turned it with a wary eye mister Alfred Lammle came round to the Albany to breakfast with Fledgeby Present on the table one scanty pot of tea one scanty loaf two scanty pats of butter two scanty rashers of bacon two pitiful eggs and an abundance of handsome china bought a secondhand bargain What did you think of Georgiana asked mister Lammle Why I ll tell you said Fledgeby very deliberately Do my boy You misunderstand me said Fledgeby I don t mean I ll tell you that I mean I ll tell you something else Tell me anything old fellow Ah but there you misunderstand me again said Fledgeby I mean I ll tell you nothing mister Lammle sparkled at him but frowned at him too Look here said Fledgeby You re deep and you re ready Whether I am deep or not never mind I am not ready But I can do one thing Lammle I can hold my tongue And I intend always doing it You are a long headed fellow Fledgeby May be or may not be If I am a short tongued fellow it may amount to the same thing Now Lammle I am never going to answer questions My dear fellow it was the simplest question in the world Never mind It seemed so but things are not always what they seem I saw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall Questions put to him seemed the simplest in the world but turned out to be anything rather than that after he had answered em Very well Then he should have held his tongue If he had held his tongue he would have kept out of scrapes that he got into If I had held my tongue you would never have seen the subject of my question remarked Lammle darkening Now Lammle said Fascination Fledgeby calmly feeling for his whisker it won t do I won t be led on into a discussion I can t manage a discussion But I can manage to hold my tongue Can mister Lammle fell back upon propitiation I should think you could Why when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them the more talkative they get the more silent you get The more they let out the more you keep in I don t object Lammle returned Fledgeby with an internal chuckle to being understood though I object to being questioned That certainly IS the way I do it And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures none of us ever know what a single venture of yours is And none of you ever will from me Lammle replied Fledgeby with another internal chuckle that certainly IS the way I do it Why of course it is I know rejoined Lammle with a flourish of frankness and a laugh and stretching out his hands as if to show the universe a remarkable man in Fledgeby If I hadn t known it of my Fledgeby should I have proposed our little compact of advantage to my Fledgeby Ah remarked Fascination shaking his head slyly But I am not to be got at in that way I am not vain That sort of vanity don t pay Lammle No no no Compliments only make me hold my tongue the more Alfred Lammle pushed his plate away no great sacrifice under the circumstances of there being so little in it thrust his hands in his pockets leaned back in his chair and contemplated Fledgeby in silence Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket and made that bush of his whiskers still contemplating him in silence Then he slowly broke silence and slowly said What the Dev il is this fellow about this morning Now look here Lammle said Fascination Fledgeby with the meanest of twinkles in his meanest of eyes which were too near together by the way look here Lammle I am very well aware that I didn t show to advantage last night and that you and your wife who I consider is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman did I am not calculated to show to advantage under that sort of circumstances I know very well you two did show to advantage and managed capitally But don t you on that account come talking to me as if I was your doll and puppet because I am not And all this cried Alfred after studying with a look the meanness that was fain to have the meanest help and yet was so mean as to turn upon it all this because of one simple natural question You should have waited till I thought proper to say something about it of myself I don t like your coming over me with your Georgianas as if you was her proprietor and mine too Well when you are in the gracious mind to say anything about it of yourself retorted Lammle pray do I have done it I have said you managed capitally You and your wife both If you ll go on managing capitally I ll go on doing my part Only don t crow I crow exclaimed Lammle shrugging his shoulders Or pursued the other or take it in your head that people are your puppets because they don t come out to advantage at the particular moments when you do with the assistance of a very clever and agreeable wife All the rest keep on doing and let missus Lammle keep on doing Now I have held my tongue when I thought proper and I have spoken when I thought proper and there s an end of that And now the question is proceeded Fledgeby with the greatest reluctance will you have another egg No I won t said Lammle shortly Perhaps you re right and will find yourself better without it replied Fascination in greatly improved spirits To ask you if you ll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery for it would make you thirsty all day Will you have some more bread and butter No I won t repeated Lammle Then I will said Fascination And it was not a mere retort for the sound s sake but was a cheerful cogent consequence of the refusal for if Lammle had applied himself again to the loaf it would have been so heavily visited in Fledgeby s opinion as to demand abstinence from bread on his part for the remainder of that meal at least if not for the whole of the next Whether this young gentleman for he was but three and twenty combined with the miserly vice of an old man any of the open handed vices of a young one was a moot point so very honourably did he keep his own counsel He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment and liked to dress well but he drove a bargain for every moveable about him from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast table and every bargain by representing somebody s ruin or somebody s loss acquired a peculiar charm for him It was a part of his avarice to take within narrow bounds long odds at races if he won he drove harder bargains if he lost he half starved himself until next time Why money should be so precious to an Ass too dull and mean to exchange it for any other satisfaction is strange but there is no animal so sure to get laden with it as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L S D not Luxury Sensuality Dissoluteness which they often stand for but the three dry letters Your concentrated Fox is seldom comparable to your concentrated Ass in money breeding Fascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on his means but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill broking line and to put money out at high interest in various ways His circle of familiar acquaintance from mister Lammle round all had a touch of the outlaw as to their rovings in the merry greenwood of Jobbery Forest lying on the outskirts of the Share Market and the Stock Exchange I suppose you Lammle said Fledgeby eating his bread and butter always did go in for female society Always replied Lammle glooming considerably under his late treatment Came natural to you eh said Fledgeby The sex were pleased to like me sir said Lammle sulkily but with the air of a man who had not been able to help himself Made a pretty good thing of marrying didn t you asked Fledgeby The other smiled an ugly smile and tapped one tap upon his nose My late governor made a mess of it said Fledgeby But Geor is the right name Georgina or Georgiana Georgiana I was thinking yesterday I didn t know there was such a name I thought it must end in ina Why Why you play if you can the Concertina you know replied Fledgeby meditating very slowly And you have when you catch it the Scarlatina And you can come down from a balloon in a parach no you can t though Well say Georgeute I mean Georgiana You were going to remark of Georgiana Lammle moodily hinted after waiting in vain I was going to remark of Georgiana sir said Fledgeby not at all pleased to be reminded of his having forgotten it that she don t seem to be violent Don t seem to be of the pitching in order She has the gentleness of the dove mister Fledgeby Of course you ll say so replied Fledgeby sharpening the moment his interest was touched by another But you know the real look out is this what I say not what you say I say having my late governor and my late mother in my eye that Georgiana don t seem to be of the pitching in order The respected mister Lammle was a bully by nature and by usual practice Perceiving as Fledgeby s affronts cumulated that conciliation by no means answered the purpose here he now directed a scowling look into Fledgeby s small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment Satisfied by what he saw there he burst into a violent passion and struck his hand upon the table making the china ring and dance You are a very offensive fellow sir cried mister Lammle rising You are a highly offensive scoundrel What do you mean by this behaviour I say remonstrated Fledgeby Don t break out You are a very offensive fellow sir repeated mister Lammle You are a highly offensive scoundrel I SAY you know urged Fledgeby quailing Why you coarse and vulgar vagabond said mister Lammle looking fiercely about him if your servant was here to give me sixpence of your money to get my boots cleaned afterwards for you are not worth the expenditure I d kick you No you wouldn t pleaded Fledgeby I am sure you d think better of it I tell you what mister Fledgeby said Lammle advancing on him Since you presume to contradict me I ll assert myself a little Give me your nose Fledgeby covered it with his hand instead and said retreating I beg you won t Give me your nose sir repeated Lammle Still covering that feature and backing mister Fledgeby reiterated apparently with a severe cold in his head I beg I beg you won t And this fellow exclaimed Lammle stopping and making the most of his chest This fellow presumes on my having selected him out of all the young fellows I know for an advantageous opportunity This fellow presumes on my having in my desk round the corner his dirty note of hand for a wretched sum payable on the occurrence of a certain event which event can only be of my and my wife s bringing about This fellow Fledgeby presumes to be impertinent to me Lammle Give me your nose sir No Stop I beg your pardon said Fledgeby with humility What do you say sir demanded mister Lammle seeming too furious to understand I beg your pardon repeated Fledgeby Repeat your words louder sir The just indignation of a gentleman has sent the blood boiling to my head I don t hear you I say repeated Fledgeby with laborious explanatory politeness I beg your pardon mister Lammle paused As a man of honour said he throwing himself into a chair I am disarmed mister Fledgeby also took a chair though less demonstratively and by slow approaches removed his hand from his nose Some natural diffidence assailed him as to blowing it so shortly after its having assumed a personal and delicate not to say public character but he overcame his scruples by degrees and modestly took that liberty under an implied protest Lammle he said sneakingly when that was done I hope we are friends again mister Fledgeby returned Lammle say no more I must have gone too far in making myself disagreeable said Fledgeby but I never intended it Say no more say no more mister Lammle repeated in a magnificent tone Give me your Fledgeby started hand They shook hands and on mister Lammle s part in particular there ensued great geniality For he was quite as much of a dastard as the other and had been in equal danger of falling into the second place for good when he took heart just in time to act upon the information conveyed to him by Fledgeby s eye The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding Incessant machinations were to be kept at work by mister and missus Lammle love was to be made for Fledgeby and conquest was to be insured to him he on his part very humbly admitting his defects as to the softer social arts and entreating to be backed to the utmost by his two able coadjutors Little recked mister Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his Young Person He regarded her as safe within the Temple of Podsnappery hiding the fulness of time when she Georgiana should take him Fitz Podsnap who with all his worldly goods should her endow It would call a blush into the cheek of his standard Young Person to have anything to do with such matters save to take as directed and with worldly goods as per settlement to be endowed Who giveth this woman to be married to this man I Podsnap Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation should come between It was a public holiday and Fledgeby did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon Walking into the City in the holiday afternoon he walked against a living stream setting out of it and thus when he turned into the precincts of saint Mary Axe he found a prevalent repose and quiet there A yellow overhanging plaster fronted house at which he stopped was quiet too The blinds were all drawn down and the inscription Pubsey and company seemed to doze in the counting house window on the ground floor giving on the sleepy street Fledgeby knocked and rang and Fledgeby rang and knocked but no one came Fledgeby crossed the narrow street and looked up at the house windows but nobody looked down at Fledgeby He got out of temper crossed the narrow street again and pulled the housebell as if it were the house s nose and he were taking a hint from his late experience His ear at the keyhole seemed then at last to give him assurance that something stirred within His eye at the keyhole seemed to confirm his ear for he angrily pulled the house s nose again and pulled and pulled and continued to pull until a human nose appeared in the dark doorway Now you sir cried Fledgeby These are nice games He addressed an old Jewish man in an ancient coat long of skirt and wide of pocket A venerable man bald and shining at the top of his head and with long grey hair flowing down at its sides and mingling with his beard A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage bent his head and stretched out his hands with the palms downward as if to deprecate the wrath of a superior What have you been up to said Fledgeby storming at him Generous Christian master urged the Jewish man it being holiday I looked for no one Holiday he blowed said Fledgeby entering What have YOU got to do with holidays Shut the door With his former action the old man obeyed In the entry hung his rusty large brimmed low crowned hat as long out of date as his coat in the corner near it stood his staff no walking stick but a veritable staff Fledgeby turned into the counting house perched himself on a business stool and cocked his hat There were light boxes on shelves in the counting house and strings of mock beads hanging up There were samples of cheap clocks and samples of cheap vases of flowers Foreign toys all Perched on the stool with his hat cocked on his head and one of his legs dangling the youth of Fledgeby hardly contrasted to advantage with the age of the Jewish man as he stood with his bare head bowed and his eyes which he only raised in speaking on the ground His clothing was worn down to the rusty hue of the hat in the entry but though he looked shabby he did not look mean Now Fledgeby though not shabby did look mean You have not told me what you were up to you sir said Fledgeby scratching his head with the brim of his hat Sir I was breathing the air In the cellar that you didn t hear On the house top Upon my soul That s a way of doing business Sir the old man represented with a grave and patient air there must be two parties to the transaction of business and the holiday has left me alone Ah Can t be buyer and seller too That s what the Jews say ain t it At least we say truly if we say so answered the old man with a smile Your people need speak the truth sometimes for they lie enough remarked Fascination Fledgeby Sir there is returned the old man with quiet emphasis too much untruth among all denominations of men Rather dashed Fascination Fledgeby took another scratch at his intellectual head with his hat to gain time for rallying For instance he resumed as though it were he who had spoken last who but you and I ever heard of a poor Jew The Jews said the old man raising his eyes from the ground with his former smile They hear of poor Jews often and are very good to them Bother that returned Fledgeby You know what I mean You d persuade me if you could that you are a poor Jew I wish you d confess how much you really did make out of my late governor I should have a better opinion of you The old man only bent his head and stretched out his hands as before Don t go on posturing like a Deaf and Dumb School said the ingenious Fledgeby but express yourself like a Christian or as nearly as you can I had had sickness and misfortunes and was so poor said the old man as hopelessly to owe the father principal and interest The son inheriting was so merciful as to forgive me both and place me here He made a little gesture as though he kissed the hem of an imaginary garment worn by the noble youth before him It was humbly done but picturesquely and was not abasing to the doer You won t say more I see said Fledgeby looking at him as if he would like to try the effect of extracting a double tooth or two and so it s of no use my putting it to you But confess this Riah who believes you to be poor now No one said the old man There you re right assented Fledgeby No one repeated the old man with a grave slow wave of his head All scout it as a fable Were I to say This little fancy business is not mine with a lithe sweep of his easily turning hand around him to comprehend the various objects on the shelves it is the little business of a Christian young gentleman who places me his servant in trust and charge here and to whom I am accountable for every single bead they would laugh When in the larger money business I tell the borrowers I say old chap interposed Fledgeby I hope you mind what you DO tell em Sir I tell them no more than I am about to repeat When I tell them I cannot promise this I cannot answer for the other I must see my principal I have not the money I am a poor man and it does not rest with me they are so unbelieving and so impatient that they sometimes curse me in Jehovah s name That s deuced good that is said Fascination Fledgeby And at other times they say Can it never be done without these tricks mister Riah Come come mister Riah we know the arts of your people my people If the money is to be lent fetch it fetch it if it is not to be lent keep it and say so They never believe me THAT S all right said Fascination Fledgeby They say We know mister Riah we know We have but to look at you and we know Oh a good un are you for the post thought Fledgeby and a good un was I to mark you out for it I may be slow but I am precious sure Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of mister Fledgeby s breath lest it should tend to put his servant s price up But looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his head bowed and his eyes cast down he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness an inch of his grey hair an inch of his coat skirt an inch of his hat brim an inch of his walking staff would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds Look here Riah said Fledgeby mollified by these self approving considerations I want to go a little more into buying up queer bills Look out in that direction Sir it shall be done Casting my eye over the accounts I find that branch of business pays pretty fairly and I am game for extending it I like to know people s affairs likewise So look out Sir I will promptly Put it about in the right quarters that you ll buy queer bills by the lump by the pound weight if that s all supposing you see your way to a fair chance on looking over the parcel And there s one thing more Come to me with the books for periodical inspection as usual at eight on Monday morning Riah drew some folding tablets from his breast and noted it down That s all I wanted to say at the present time continued Fledgeby in a grudging vein as he got off the stool except that I wish you d take the air where you can hear the bell or the knocker either one of the two or both By the by how DO you take the air at the top of the house Do you stick your head out of a chimney pot Sir there are leads there and I have made a little garden there To bury your money in you old dodger A thumbnail s space of garden would hold the treasure I bury master said Riah Twelve shillings a week even when they are an old man s wages bury themselves I should like to know what you really are worth returned Fledgeby with whom his growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very convenient fiction But come Let s have a look at your garden on the tiles before I go The old man took a step back and hesitated Truly sir I have company there Have you by George said Fledgeby I suppose you happen to know whose premises these are Sir they are yours and I am your servant in them Oh I thought you might have overlooked that retorted Fledgeby with his eyes on Riah s beard as he felt for his own having company on my premises you know Come up and see the guests sir I hope for your admission that they can do no harm Passing him with a courteous reverence specially unlike any action that mister Fledgeby could for his life have imparted to his own head and hands the old man began to ascend the stairs As he toiled on before with his palm upon the stair rail and his long black skirt a very gaberdine overhanging each successive step he might have been the leader in some pilgrimage of devotional ascent to a prophet s tomb Not troubled by any such weak imagining Fascination Fledgeby merely speculated on the time of life at which his beard had begun and thought once more what a good un he was for the part Some final wooden steps conducted them stooping under a low penthouse roof to the house top Riah stood still and turning to his master pointed out his guests Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren For whom perhaps with some old instinct of his race the gentle Jew had spread a carpet Seated on it against no more romantic object than a blackened chimney stack over which some bumble creeper had been trained they both pored over one book both with attentive faces Jenny with the sharper Lizzie with the more perplexed Another little book or two were lying near and a common basket of common fruit and another basket full of strings of beads and tinsel scraps A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens completed the garden and the encompassing wilderness of dowager old chimneys twirled their cowls and fluttered their smoke rather as if they were bridling and fanning themselves and looking on in a state of airy surprise Taking her eyes off the book to test her memory of something in it Lizzie was the first to see herself observed As she rose Miss Wren likewise became conscious and said irreverently addressing the great chief of the premises Whoever you are I can t get up because my back s bad and my legs are queer This is my master said Riah stepping forward Don t look like anybody s master observed Miss Wren to herself with a hitch of her chin and eyes This sir pursued the old man is a little dressmaker for little people Explain to the master Jenny Dolls that s all said Jenny shortly Very difficult to fit too because their figures are so uncertain You never know where to expect their waists Her friend resumed the old man motioning towards Lizzie and as industrious as virtuous But that they both are They are busy early and late sir early and late and in bye times as on this holiday they go to book learning Not much good to be got out of that remarked Fledgeby Depends upon the person quoth Miss Wren snapping him up I made acquaintance with my guests sir pursued the Jew with an evident purpose of drawing out the dressmaker through their coming here to buy of our damage and waste for Miss Jenny s millinery Our waste goes into the best of company sir on her rosy cheeked little customers They wear it in their hair and on their ball dresses and even so she tells me are presented at Court with it Ah said Fledgeby on whose intelligence this doll fancy made rather strong demands she s been buying that basketful to day I suppose I suppose she has Miss Jenny interposed and paying for it too most likely Let s have a look at it said the suspicious chief Riah handed it to him How much for this now Two precious silver shillings said Miss Wren Riah confirmed her with two nods as Fledgeby looked to him A nod for each shilling Well said Fledgeby poking into the contents of the basket with his forefinger the price is not so bad You have got good measure Miss What is it Try Jenny suggested that young lady with great calmness You have got good measure Miss Jenny but the price is not so bad And you said Fledgeby turning to the other visitor do you buy anything here miss No sir Nor sell anything neither miss No sir Looking askew at the questioner Jenny stole her hand up to her friend s and drew her friend down so that she bent beside her on her knee We are thankful to come here for rest sir said Jenny You see you don t know what the rest of this place is to us does he Lizzie It s the quiet and the air The quiet repeated Fledgeby with a contemptuous turn of his head towards the City s roar And the air with a Poof at the smoke Ah said Jenny But it s so high And you see the clouds rushing on above the narrow streets not minding them and you see the golden arrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes and you feel as if you were dead The little creature looked above her holding up her slight transparent hand How do you feel when you are dead asked Fledgeby much perplexed Oh so tranquil cried the little creature smiling Oh so peaceful and so thankful And you hear the people who are alive crying and working and calling to one another down in the close dark streets and you seem to pity them so And such a chain has fallen from you and such a strange good sorrowful happiness comes upon you Her eyes fell on the old man who with his hands folded quietly looked on Why it was only just now said the little creature pointing at him that I fancied I saw him come out of his grave He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn and then he took his breath and stood upright and looked all round him at the sky and the wind blew upon him and his life down in the dark was over Till he was called back to life she added looking round at Fledgeby with that lower look of sharpness Why did you call him back He was long enough coming anyhow grumbled Fledgeby But you are not dead you know said Jenny Wren Get down to life mister Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion and with a nod turned round As Riah followed to attend him down the stairs the little creature called out to the Jew in a silvery tone Don t be long gone Come back and be dead And still as they went down they heard the little sweet voice more and more faintly half calling and half singing Come back and be dead Come back and be dead When they got down into the entry Fledgeby pausing under the shadow of the broad old hat and mechanically poising the staff said to the old man That s a handsome girl that one in her senses And as good as handsome answered Riah At all events observed Fledgeby with a dry whistle I hope she ain t bad enough to put any chap up to the fastenings and get the premises broken open You look out Keep your weather eye awake and don t make any more acquaintances however handsome Of course you always keep my name to yourself Sir assuredly I do If they ask it say it s Pubsey or say it s company or say it s anything you like but what it is His grateful servant in whose race gratitude is deep strong and enduring bowed his head and actually did now put the hem of his coat to his lips though so lightly that the wearer knew nothing of it Thus Fascination Fledgeby went his way exulting in the artful cleverness with which he had turned his thumb down on a Jew and the old man went his different way up stairs As he mounted the call or song began to sound in his ears again and looking above he saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair and musically repeating to him like a vision Come up and be dead Come up and be dead Chapter six A RIDDLE WITHOUT AN ANSWER Again mister Mortimer Lightwood and mister Eugene Wrayburn sat together in the Temple This evening however they were not together in the place of business of the eminent solicitor but in another dismal set of chambers facing it on the same second floor on whose dungeon like black outer door appeared the legend PRIVATE mister EUGENE WRAYBURN mister MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD mister Lightwood s Offices opposite Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution The white letters of the inscription were extremely white and extremely strong to the sense of smell the complexion of the tables and chairs was like Lady Tippins s a little too blooming to be believed in and the carpets and floorcloth seemed to rush at the beholder s face in the unusual prominency of their patterns But the Temple accustomed to tone down both the still life and the human life that has much to do with it would soon get the better of all that Well said Eugene on one side of the fire I feel tolerably comfortable I hope the upholsterer may do the same Why shouldn t he asked Lightwood from the other side of the fire To be sure pursued Eugene reflecting he is not in the secret of our pecuniary affairs so perhaps he may be in an easy frame of mind We shall pay him said Mortimer Shall we really returned Eugene indolently surprised You don t say so I mean to pay him Eugene for my part said Mortimer in a slightly injured tone Ah I mean to pay him too retorted Eugene But then I mean so much that I that I don t mean Don t mean So much that I only mean and shall always only mean and nothing more my dear Mortimer It s the same thing His friend lying back in his easy chair watched him lying back in his easy chair as he stretched out his legs on the hearth rug and said with the amused look that Eugene Wrayburn could always awaken in him without seeming to try or care Anyhow your vagaries have increased the bill Calls the domestic virtues vagaries exclaimed Eugene raising his eyes to the ceiling This very complete little kitchen of ours said Mortimer in which nothing will ever be cooked My dear dear Mortimer returned his friend lazily lifting his head a little to look at him how often have I pointed out to you that its moral influence is the important thing Its moral influence on this fellow exclaimed Lightwood laughing Do me the favour said Eugene getting out of his chair with much gravity to come and inspect that feature of our establishment which you rashly disparage With that taking up a candle he conducted his chum into the fourth room of the set of chambers a little narrow room which was very completely and neatly fitted as a kitchen See said Eugene miniature flour barrel rolling pin spice box shelf of brown jars chopping board coffee mill dresser elegantly furnished with crockery saucepans and pans roasting jack a charming kettle an armoury of dish covers The moral influence of these objects in forming the domestic virtues may have an immense influence upon me not upon you for you are a hopeless case but upon me In fact I have an idea that I feel the domestic virtues already forming Do me the favour to step into my bedroom Secretaire you see and abstruse set of solid mahogany pigeon holes one for every letter of the alphabet To what use do I devote them I receive a bill say from Jones I docket it neatly at the secretaire JONES and I put it into pigeonhole J It s the next thing to a receipt and is quite as satisfactory to ME And I very much wish Mortimer sitting on his bed with the air of a philosopher lecturing a disciple that my example might induce YOU to cultivate habits of punctuality and method and by means of the moral influences with which I have surrounded you to encourage the formation of the domestic virtues Mortimer laughed again with his usual commentaries of How CAN you be so ridiculous Eugene and What an absurd fellow you are but when his laugh was out there was something serious if not anxious in his face Despite that pernicious assumption of lassitude and indifference which had become his second nature he was strongly attached to his friend He had founded himself upon Eugene when they were yet boys at school and at this hour imitated him no less admired him no less loved him no less than in those departed days Eugene said he if I could find you in earnest for a minute I would try to say an earnest word to you An earnest word repeated Eugene The moral influences are beginning to work Say on Well I will returned the other though you are not earnest yet In this desire for earnestness murmured Eugene with the air of one who was meditating deeply I trace the happy influences of the little flour barrel and the coffee mill Gratifying Eugene resumed Mortimer disregarding the light interruption and laying a hand upon Eugene s shoulder as he Mortimer stood before him seated on his bed you are withholding something from me Eugene looked at him but said nothing All this past summer you have been withholding something from me Before we entered on our boating vacation you were as bent upon it as I have seen you upon anything since we first rowed together But you cared very little for it when it came often found it a tie and a drag upon you and were constantly away Now it was well enough half a dozen times a dozen times twenty times to say to me in your own odd manner which I know so well and like so much that your disappearances were precautions against our boring one another but of course after a short while I began to know that they covered something I don t ask what it is as you have not told me but the fact is so Say is it not I give you my word of honour Mortimer returned Eugene after a serious pause of a few moments that I don t know Don t know Eugene Upon my soul don t know I know less about myself than about most people in the world and I don t know You have some design in your mind Have I I don t think I have At any rate you have some subject of interest there which used not to be there I really can t say replied Eugene shaking his head blankly after pausing again to reconsider At times I have thought yes at other times I have thought no Now I have been inclined to pursue such a subject now I have felt that it was absurd and that it tired and embarrassed me Absolutely I can t say Frankly and faithfully I would if I could So replying he clapped a hand in his turn on his friend s shoulder as he rose from his seat upon the bed and said You must take your friend as he is You know what I am my dear Mortimer You know how dreadfully susceptible I am to boredom You know that when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum I bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant You know that at length I gave it up and declined to guess any more Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered The old nursery form runs Riddle me riddle me ree p raps you can t tell me what this may be My reply runs No Upon my life I can t So much of what was fantastically true to his own knowledge of this utterly careless Eugene mingled with the answer that Mortimer could not receive it as a mere evasion Besides it was given with an engaging air of openness and of special exemption of the one friend he valued from his reckless indifference Come dear boy said Eugene Let us try the effect of smoking If it enlightens me at all on this question I will impart unreservedly They returned to the room they had come from and finding it heated opened a window Having lighted their cigars they leaned out of this window smoking and looking down at the moonlight as it shone into the court below No enlightenment resumed Eugene after certain minutes of silence I feel sincerely apologetic my dear Mortimer but nothing comes If nothing comes returned Mortimer nothing can come from it So I shall hope that this may hold good throughout and that there may be nothing on foot Nothing injurious to you Eugene or Eugene stayed him for a moment with his hand on his arm while he took a piece of earth from an old flowerpot on the window sill and dexterously shot it at a little point of light opposite having done which to his satisfaction he said Or Or injurious to any one else How said Eugene taking another little piece of earth and shooting it with great precision at the former mark how injurious to any one else I don t know And said Eugene taking as he said the word another shot to whom else I don t know Checking himself with another piece of earth in his hand Eugene looked at his friend inquiringly and a little suspiciously There was no concealed or half expressed meaning in his face Two belated wanderers in the mazes of the law said Eugene attracted by the sound of footsteps and glancing down as he spoke stray into the court They examine the door posts of number one seeking the name they want Not finding it at number one they come to number two On the hat of wanderer number two the shorter one I drop this pellet Hitting him on the hat I smoke serenely and become absorbed in contemplation of the sky Both the wanderers looked up towards the window but after interchanging a mutter or two soon applied themselves to the door posts below There they seemed to discover what they wanted for they disappeared from view by entering at the doorway When they emerge said Eugene you shall see me bring them both down and so prepared two pellets for the purpose He had not reckoned on their seeking his name or Lightwood s But either the one or the other would seem to be in question for now there came a knock at the door I am on duty to night said Mortimer stay you where you are Eugene Requiring no persuasion he stayed there smoking quietly and not at all curious to know who knocked until Mortimer spoke to him from within the room and touched him Then drawing in his head he found the visitors to be young Charley Hexam and the schoolmaster both standing facing him and both recognized at a glance You recollect this young fellow Eugene said Mortimer Let me look at him returned Wrayburn coolly Oh yes yes I recollect him He had not been about to repeat that former action of taking him by the chin but the boy had suspected him of it and had thrown up his arm with an angry start Laughingly Wrayburn looked to Lightwood for an explanation of this odd visit He says he has something to say Surely it must be to you Mortimer So I thought but he says no He says it is to you Yes I do say so interposed the boy And I mean to say what I want to say too mister Eugene Wrayburn Passing him with his eyes as if there were nothing where he stood Eugene looked on to Bradley Headstone With consummate indolence he turned to Mortimer inquiring And who may this other person be I am Charles Hexam s friend said Bradley I am Charles Hexam s schoolmaster My good sir you should teach your pupils better manners returned Eugene Composedly smoking he leaned an elbow on the chimneypiece at the side of the fire and looked at the schoolmaster It was a cruel look in its cold disdain of him as a creature of no worth The schoolmaster looked at him and that too was a cruel look though of the different kind that it had a raging jealousy and fiery wrath in it Very remarkably neither Eugene Wrayburn nor Bradley Headstone looked at all at the boy Through the ensuing dialogue those two no matter who spoke or whom was addressed looked at each other There was some secret sure perception between them which set them against one another in all ways In some high respects mister Eugene Wrayburn said Bradley answering him with pale and quivering lips the natural feelings of my pupils are stronger than my teaching In most respects I dare say replied Eugene enjoying his cigar though whether high or low is of no importance You have my name very correctly Pray what is yours It cannot concern you much to know but True interposed Eugene striking sharply and cutting him short at his mistake it does not concern me at all to know I can say Schoolmaster which is a most respectable title You are right Schoolmaster It was not the dullest part of this goad in its galling of Bradley Headstone that he had made it himself in a moment of incautious anger He tried to set his lips so as to prevent their quivering but they quivered fast mister Eugene Wrayburn said the boy I want a word with you I have wanted it so much that we have looked out your address in the book and we have been to your office and we have come from your office here You have given yourself much trouble Schoolmaster observed Eugene blowing the feathery ash from his cigar I hope it may prove remunerative And I am glad to speak pursued the boy in presence of mister Lightwood because it was through mister Lightwood that you ever saw my sister For a mere moment Wrayburn turned his eyes aside from the schoolmaster to note the effect of the last word on Mortimer who standing on the opposite side of the fire as soon as the word was spoken turned his face towards the fire and looked down into it Similarly it was through mister Lightwood that you ever saw her again for you were with him on the night when my father was found and so I found you with her on the next day Since then you have seen my sister often You have seen my sister oftener and oftener And I want to know why Was this worth while Schoolmaster murmured Eugene with the air of a disinterested adviser So much trouble for nothing You should know best but I think not I don t know mister Wrayburn answered Bradley with his passion rising why you address me Don t you said Eugene Then I won t He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity that the respectable right hand clutching the respectable hair guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it Not another word did Eugene deem it worth while to utter but stood leaning his head upon his hand smoking and looking imperturbably at the chafing Bradley Headstone with his clutching right hand until Bradley was wellnigh mad mister Wrayburn proceeded the boy we not only know this that I have charged upon you but we know more It has not yet come to my sister s knowledge that we have found it out but we have We had a plan mister Headstone and I for my sister s education and for its being advised and overlooked by mister Headstone who is a much more competent authority whatever you may pretend to think as you smoke than you could produce if you tried Then what do we find What do we find mister Lightwood Why we find that my sister is already being taught without our knowing it We find that while my sister gives an unwilling and cold ear to our schemes for her advantage I her brother and mister Headstone the most competent authority as his certificates would easily prove that could be produced she is wilfully and willingly profiting by other schemes Ay and taking pains too for I know what such pains are And so does mister Headstone Well Somebody pays for this is a thought that naturally occurs to us who pays We apply ourselves to find out mister Lightwood and we find that your friend this mister Eugene Wrayburn here pays Then I ask him what right has he to do it and what does he mean by it and how comes he to be taking such a liberty without my consent when I am raising myself in the scale of society by my own exertions and mister Headstone s aid and have no right to have any darkness cast upon my prospects or any imputation upon my respectability through my sister The boyish weakness of this speech combined with its great selfishness made it a poor one indeed And yet Bradley Headstone used to the little audience of a school and unused to the larger ways of men showed a kind of exultation in it Now I tell mister Eugene Wrayburn pursued the boy forced into the use of the third person by the hopelessness of addressing him in the first that I object to his having any acquaintance at all with my sister and that I request him to drop it altogether He is not to take it into his head that I am afraid of my sister s caring for HIM As the boy sneered the Master sneered and Eugene blew off the feathery ash again But I object to it and that s enough I am more important to my sister than he thinks As I raise myself I intend to raise her she knows that and she has to look to me for her prospects Now I understand all this very well and so does mister Headstone My sister is an excellent girl but she has some romantic notions not about such things as your mister Eugene Wrayburns but about the death of my father and other matters of that sort mister Wrayburn encourages those notions to make himself of importance and so she thinks she ought to be grateful to him and perhaps even likes to be Now I don t choose her to be grateful to him or to be grateful to anybody but me except mister Headstone And I tell mister Wrayburn that if he don t take heed of what I say it will be worse for her Let him turn that over in his memory and make sure of it Worse for her A pause ensued in which the schoolmaster looked very awkward May I suggest Schoolmaster said Eugene removing his fast waning cigar from his lips to glance at it that you can now take your pupil away And mister Lightwood added the boy with a burning face under the flaming aggravation of getting no sort of answer or attention I hope you ll take notice of what I have said to your friend and of what your friend has heard me say word by word whatever he pretends to the contrary You are bound to take notice of it mister Lightwood for as I have already mentioned you first brought your friend into my sister s company and but for you we never should have seen him Lord knows none of us ever wanted him any more than any of us will ever miss him Now mister Headstone as mister Eugene Wrayburn has been obliged to hear what I had to say and couldn t help himself and as I have said it out to the last word we have done all we wanted to do and may go Go down stairs and leave me a moment Hexam he returned The boy complying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make swung out of the room and Lightwood went to the window and leaned there looking out You think me of no more value than the dirt under your feet said Bradley to Eugene speaking in a carefully weighed and measured tone or he could not have spoken at all I assure you Schoolmaster replied Eugene I don t think about you That s not true returned the other you know better That s coarse Eugene retorted but you DON T know better mister Wrayburn at least I know very well that it would be idle to set myself against you in insolent words or overbearing manners That lad who has just gone out could put you to shame in half a dozen branches of knowledge in half an hour but you can throw him aside like an inferior You can do as much by me I have no doubt beforehand Possibly remarked Eugene But I am more than a lad said Bradley with his clutching hand and I WILL be heard sir As a schoolmaster said Eugene you are always being heard That ought to content you But it does not content me replied the other white with passion Do you suppose that a man in forming himself for the duties I discharge and in watching and repressing himself daily to discharge them well dismisses a man s nature I suppose you said Eugene judging from what I see as I look at you to be rather too passionate for a good schoolmaster As he spoke he tossed away the end of his cigar Passionate with you sir I admit I am Passionate with you sir I respect myself for being But I have not Devils for my pupils For your Teachers I should rather say replied Eugene mister Wrayburn Schoolmaster Sir my name is Bradley Headstone As you justly said my good sir your name cannot concern me Now what more This more Oh what a misfortune is mine cried Bradley breaking off to wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to foot that I cannot so control myself as to appear a stronger creature than this when a man who has not felt in all his life what I have felt in a day can so command himself He said it in a very agony and even followed it with an errant motion of his hands as if he could have torn himself Eugene Wrayburn looked on at him as if he found him beginning to be rather an entertaining study mister Wrayburn I desire to say something to you on my own part Come come Schoolmaster returned Eugene with a languid approach to impatience as the other again struggled with himself say what you have to say And let me remind you that the door is standing open and your young friend waiting for you on the stairs When I accompanied that youth here sir I did so with the purpose of adding as a man whom you should not be permitted to put aside in case you put him aside as a boy that his instinct is correct and right Thus Bradley Headstone with great effort and difficulty Is that all asked Eugene No sir said the other flushed and fierce I strongly support him in his disapproval of your visits to his sister and in his objection to your officiousness and worse in what you have taken upon yourself to do for her Is THAT all asked Eugene No sir I determined to tell you that you are not justified in these proceedings and that they are injurious to his sister Are you her schoolmaster as well as her brother s Or perhaps you would like to be said Eugene It was a stab that the blood followed in its rush to Bradley Headstone s face as swiftly as if it had been dealt with a dagger What do you mean by that was as much as he could utter A natural ambition enough said Eugene coolly Far be it from me to say otherwise The sister who is something too much upon your lips perhaps is so very different from all the associations to which she had been used and from all the low obscure people about her that it is a very natural ambition Do you throw my obscurity in my teeth mister Wrayburn That can hardly be for I know nothing concerning it Schoolmaster and seek to know nothing You reproach me with my origin said Bradley Headstone you cast insinuations at my bringing up But I tell you sir I have worked my way onward out of both and in spite of both and have a right to be considered a better man than you with better reasons for being proud How I can reproach you with what is not within my knowledge or how I can cast stones that were never in my hand is a problem for the ingenuity of a schoolmaster to prove returned Eugene Is THAT all No sir If you suppose that boy Who really will be tired of waiting said Eugene politely If you suppose that boy to be friendless mister Wrayburn you deceive yourself I am his friend and you shall find me so And you will find HIM on the stairs remarked Eugene You may have promised yourself sir that you could do what you chose here because you had to deal with a mere boy inexperienced friendless and unassisted But I give you warning that this mean calculation is wrong You have to do with a man also You have to do with me I will support him and if need be require reparation for him My hand and heart are in this cause and are open to him And quite a coincidence the door is open remarked Eugene I scorn your shifty evasions and I scorn you said the schoolmaster In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my birth I hold you in contempt for it But if you don t profit by this visit and act accordingly you will find me as bitterly in earnest against you as I could be if I deemed you worth a second thought on my own account With a consciously bad grace and stiff manner as Wrayburn looked so easily and calmly on he went out with these words and the heavy door closed like a furnace door upon his red and white heats of rage A curious monomaniac said Eugene The man seems to believe that everybody was acquainted with his mother Mortimer Lightwood being still at the window to which he had in delicacy withdrawn Eugene called to him and he fell to slowly pacing the room My dear fellow said Eugene as he lighted another cigar I fear my unexpected visitors have been troublesome If as a set off excuse the legal phrase from a barrister at law you would like to ask Tippins to tea I pledge myself to make love to her Eugene Eugene Eugene replied Mortimer still pacing the room I am sorry for this And to think that I have been so blind How blind dear boy inquired his unmoved friend What were your words that night at the river side public house said Lightwood stopping What was it that you asked me Did I feel like a dark combination of traitor and pickpocket when I thought of that girl I seem to remember the expression said Eugene How do YOU feel when you think of her just now His friend made no direct reply but observed after a few whiffs of his cigar Don t mistake the situation There is no better girl in all this London than Lizzie Hexam There is no better among my people at home no better among your people Granted What follows There said Eugene looking after him dubiously as he paced away to the other end of the room you put me again upon guessing the riddle that I have given up Eugene do you design to capture and desert this girl My dear fellow no Do you design to marry her My dear fellow no Do you design to pursue her My dear fellow I don t design anything I have no design whatever I am incapable of designs If I conceived a design I should speedily abandon it exhausted by the operation Oh Eugene Eugene My dear Mortimer not that tone of melancholy reproach I entreat What can I do more than tell you all I know and acknowledge my ignorance of all I don t know How does that little old song go which under pretence of being cheerful is by far the most lugubrious I ever heard in my life Away with melancholy Nor doleful changes ring On life and human folly But merrily merrily sing Fal la Don t let us sing Fal la my dear Mortimer which is comparatively unmeaning but let us sing that we give up guessing the riddle altogether Are you in communication with this girl Eugene and is what these people say true I concede both admissions to my honourable and learned friend Then what is to come of it What are you doing Where are you going My dear Mortimer one would think the schoolmaster had left behind him a catechizing infection You are ruffled by the want of another cigar Take one of these I entreat Light it at mine which is in perfect order So Now do me the justice to observe that I am doing all I can towards self improvement and that you have a light thrown on those household implements which when you only saw them as in a glass darkly you were hastily I must say hastily inclined to depreciate Sensible of my deficiencies I have surrounded myself with moral influences expressly meant to promote the formation of the domestic virtues To those influences and to the improving society of my friend from boyhood commend me with your best wishes Ah Eugene said Lightwood affectionately now standing near him so that they both stood in one little cloud of smoke I would that you answered my three questions What is to come of it What are you doing Where are you going And my dear Mortimer returned Eugene lightly fanning away the smoke with his hand for the better exposition of his frankness of face and manner believe me I would answer them instantly if I could But to enable me to do so I must first have found out the troublesome conundrum long abandoned Here it is Eugene Wrayburn Tapping his forehead and breast Riddle me riddle me ree perhaps you can t tell me what this may be No upon my life I can t I give it up 
978-125137-0000	train-other-500	Chapter seven IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED The arrangement between mister Boffin and his literary man mister Silas Wegg so far altered with the altered habits of mister Boffin s life
978-125137-0001	train-other-500	as that the Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently aristocratic family mansion rather than in the evening as of yore and in Boffin s Bower There were occasions however when mister Boffin seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion
978-125137-0002	train-other-500	would present himself at the Bower after dark to anticipate the next sallying forth of Wegg
none	none	 and would there on the old settle pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs 
978-125137-0003	train-other-500	If Wegg had been worse paid for his office or better qualified to discharge it
none	none	 he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable 
978-125137-0004	train-other-500	but holding the position of a handsomely remunerated humbug he resented them This was quite according to rule for the incompetent servant by whomsoever employed is always against his employer Even those born governors noble and right honourable creatures
978-125137-0005	train-other-500	who have been the most imbecile in high places have uniformly shown themselves the most opposed sometimes in belying distrust sometimes in vapid insolence to THEIR employer What is in such wise true of the public master and servant is equally true of the private master and servant all the world over
978-125137-0006	train-other-500	When mister Silas Wegg did at last obtain free access to Our House as he had been wont to call the mansion outside which he had sat shelterless so long and when he did at last find it in all particulars as different from his mental plans of it as according to the nature of things it well could be
978-125137-0007	train-other-500	that far seeing and far reaching character by way of asserting himself and making out a case for compensation affected to fall into a melancholy strain of musing over the mournful past as if the house and he had had a fall in life together
none	none	 And this sir Silas would say to his patron sadly nodding his head and musing 
978-125137-0008	train-other-500	was once Our House This sir is the building from which I have so often seen those great creatures Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane and Uncle Parker whose very names were of his own inventing
none	none	 pass and repass 
978-125137-0009	train-other-500	And has it come to this indeed Ah dear me dear me So tender were his lamentations that the kindly mister Boffin was quite sorry for him and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he had done him an irreparable injury
978-125137-0010	train-other-500	Two or three diplomatic interviews the result of great subtlety on mister Wegg s part but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling him towards Clerkenwell had enabled him to complete his bargain with mister Venus
978-125137-0011	train-other-500	Bring me round to the Bower said Silas when the bargain was closed next Saturday evening and if a sociable glass of old Jamaikey warm should meet your views I am not the man to begrudge it You are aware of my being poor company sir replied mister Venus but be it so
978-125137-0012	train-other-500	It being so here is Saturday evening come and here is mister Venus come and ringing at the Bower gate mister Wegg opens the gate descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under mister Venus s arm and remarks in a dry tone
none	none	 Oh I thought perhaps you might have come in a cab 
978-125137-0013	train-other-500	No mister Wegg replies Venus I am not above a parcel Above a parcel No says Wegg with some dissatisfaction But does not openly growl a certain sort of parcel might be above you
978-125137-0014	train-other-500	Here is your purchase mister Wegg says Venus politely handing it over and I am glad to restore it to the source from whence it flowed Thankee says Wegg
none	none	 Now this affair is concluded I may mention to you in a friendly way that I ve my doubts whether if I had consulted a lawyer 
978-125137-0015	train-other-500	you could have kept this article back from me I only throw it out as a legal point Do you think so mister Wegg I bought you in open contract You can t buy human flesh and blood in this country sir not alive you can t says Wegg shaking his head
none	none	 Then query bone 
978-125137-0016	train-other-500	As a legal point asks Venus As a legal point
none	none	 I am not competent to speak upon that mister Wegg says Venus reddening and growing something louder 
978-125137-0017	train-other-500	but upon a point of fact I think myself competent to speak
none	none	 and as a point of fact I would have seen you 
978-125137-0018	train-other-500	will you allow me to say further I wouldn t say more than further if I was you mister Wegg suggests pacifically
none	none	 Before I d have given that packet into your hand without being paid my price for it 
978-125137-0019	train-other-500	I don t pretend to know how the point of law may stand but I m thoroughly confident upon the point of fact
none	none	 As mister Venus is irritable no doubt owing to his disappointment in love 
978-125137-0020	train-other-500	and as it is not the cue of mister Wegg to have him out of temper the latter gentleman soothingly remarks I only put it as a little case
none	none	 I only put it ha porthetically Then I d rather mister Wegg you put it another time penn orth etically is mister Venus s retort 
978-125137-0021	train-other-500	for I tell you candidly I don t like your little cases Arrived by this time in mister Wegg s sitting room made bright on the chilly evening by gaslight and fire mister Venus softens and compliments him on his abode profiting by the occasion to remind Wegg that he Venus
978-125137-0022	train-other-500	told him he had got into a good thing Tolerable Wegg rejoins But bear in mind mister Venus that there s no gold without its alloy
none	none	 Mix for yourself and take a seat in the chimbley corner Will you perform upon a pipe sir 
978-125137-0023	train-other-500	I am but an indifferent performer sir returns the other but I ll accompany you with a whiff or two at intervals So mister Venus mixes and Wegg mixes and mister Venus lights and puffs and Wegg lights and puffs And there s alloy even in this metal of yours mister Wegg you was remarking
978-125137-0024	train-other-500	Mystery returns Wegg I don t like it mister Venus I don t like to have the life knocked out of former inhabitants of this house in the gloomy dark and not know who did it Might you have any suspicions mister Wegg No returns that gentleman
978-125137-0025	train-other-500	I know who profits by it But I ve no suspicions Having said which mister Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most determined expression of Charity as if he had caught that cardinal virtue by the skirts as she felt it her painful duty to depart from him and held her by main force
978-125137-0026	train-other-500	Similarly resumes Wegg I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties but I make no objections mister Venus Here is an immense fortune drops from the clouds upon a person that shall be nameless
none	none	 Here is a weekly allowance with a certain weight of coals drops from the clouds upon me 
978-125137-0027	train-other-500	Which of us is the better man Not the person that shall be nameless That s an observation of mine but I don t make it an objection I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals He takes his fortune That s the way it works
978-125137-0028	train-other-500	It would be a good thing for me if I could see things in the calm light you do mister Wegg Again look here
none	none	 pursues Silas with an oratorical flourish of his pipe and his wooden leg 
978-125137-0029	train-other-500	the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt him back in his chair here s another observation mister Venus unaccompanied with an objection Him that shall be nameless is liable to be talked over He gets talked over
none	none	 Him that shall be nameless having me at his right hand naturally looking to be promoted higher 
978-125137-0030	train-other-500	and you may perhaps say meriting to be promoted higher mister Venus murmurs that he does say so Him that shall be nameless under such circumstances passes me by and puts a talking over stranger above my head Which of us two is the better man
978-125137-0031	train-other-500	Which of us two can repeat most poetry Which of us two has in the service of him that shall be nameless tackled the Romans both civil and military till he has got as husky as if he d been weaned and ever since brought up on sawdust Not the talking over stranger
none	none	 Yet the house is as free to him as if it was his and he has his room and is put upon a footing and draws about a thousand a year I am banished to the Bower to be found in it like a piece of furniture whenever wanted Merit therefore don t win That s the way it works I observe it because I can t help observing it being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice but I don t object Ever here before mister Venus Not inside the gate mister Wegg You ve been as far as the gate then mister Venus Yes mister Wegg 
978-125137-0032	train-other-500	and peeped in from curiosity Did you see anything Nothing but the dust yard mister Wegg rolls his eyes all round the room in that ever unsatisfied quest of his and then rolls his eyes all round mister Venus as if suspicious of his having something about him to be found out
978-125137-0033	train-other-500	And yet sir he pursues
none	none	 being acquainted with old mister Harmon one would have thought it might have been polite in you too to give him a call 
978-125137-0034	train-other-500	And you re naturally of a polite disposition you are This last clause as a softening compliment to mister Venus It is true sir replies Venus winking his weak eyes and running his fingers through his dusty shock of hair that I was so before a certain observation soured me
978-125137-0035	train-other-500	You understand to what I allude mister Wegg To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light Since that all is fled save gall Not all says mister Wegg in a tone of sentimental condolence
978-125137-0036	train-other-500	Yes sir returns Venus all The world may deem it harsh but I d quite as soon pitch into my best friend as not Indeed I d sooner Involuntarily making a pass with his wooden leg to guard himself as mister Venus springs up in the emphasis of this unsociable declaration
978-125137-0037	train-other-500	mister Wegg tilts over on his back chair and all and is rescued by that harmless misanthrope in a disjointed state and ruefully rubbing his head Why you lost your balance mister Wegg says Venus handing him his pipe
978-125137-0038	train-other-500	And about time to do it grumbles Silas when a man s visitors without a word of notice conduct themselves with the sudden wiciousness of Jacks in boxes
none	none	 Don t come flying out of your chair like that mister Venus I ask your pardon mister Wegg 
978-125137-0039	train-other-500	I am so soured Yes but hang it says Wegg argumentatively a well governed mind can be soured sitting And as to being regarded in lights there s bumpey lights as well as bony IN which again rubbing his head I object to regard myself I ll bear it in memory sir
978-125137-0040	train-other-500	If you ll be so good mister Wegg slowly subdues his ironical tone and his lingering irritation and resumes his pipe We were talking of old mister Harmon being a friend of yours Not a friend mister Wegg Only known to speak to
none	none	 and to have a little deal with now and then A very inquisitive character mister Wegg regarding what was found in the dust 
978-125137-0041	train-other-500	As inquisitive as secret Ah You found him secret returns Wegg with a greedy relish
none	none	 He had always the look of it and the manner of it 
978-125137-0042	train-other-500	Ah with another roll of his eyes As to what was found in the dust now
none	none	 Did you ever hear him mention how he found it my dear friend 
978-125137-0043	train-other-500	Living on the mysterious premises one would like to know For instance where he found things Or for instance how he set about it
none	none	 Whether he began at the top of the mounds or whether he began at the bottom 
978-125137-0044	train-other-500	Whether he prodded mister Wegg s pantomime is skilful and expressive here or whether he scooped
none	none	 Should you say scooped my dear mister Venus or should you as a man say 
978-125137-0045	train-other-500	prodded I should say neither mister Wegg As a fellow man mister Venus mix again why neither Because I suppose sir that what was found was found in the sorting and sifting All the mounds are sorted and sifted You shall see em
978-125137-0046	train-other-500	and pass your opinion Mix again On each occasion of his saying mix again mister Wegg with a hop on his wooden leg hitches his chair a little nearer more as if he were proposing that himself and mister Venus should mix again than that they should replenish their glasses
none	none	 Living as I said before on the mysterious premises says Wegg when the other has acted on his hospitable entreaty one likes to know Would you be inclined to say now as a brother that he ever hid things in the dust as well as found em mister Wegg on the whole I should say he might mister Wegg claps on his spectacles and admiringly surveys mister Venus from head to foot As a mortal equally with myself whose hand I take in mine for the first time this day having unaccountably overlooked that act so full of boundless confidence binding a fellow creetur TO a fellow creetur 
978-125137-0047	train-other-500	says Wegg holding mister Venus s palm out flat and ready for smiting and now smiting it as such and no other for I scorn all lowlier ties betwixt myself and the man walking with his face erect that alone I call my Twin regarded and regarding in this trustful bond
none	none	 what do you think he might have hid 
978-125137-0048	train-other-500	It is but a supposition mister Wegg As a Being with his hand upon his heart cries Wegg and the apostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being s hand being actually upon his rum and water put your supposition into language and bring it out mister Venus
978-125137-0049	train-other-500	He was the species of old gentleman sir slowly returns that practical anatomist after drinking
none	none	 that I should judge likely to take such opportunities as this place offered of stowing away money valuables 
978-125137-0050	train-other-500	maybe papers As one that was ever an ornament to human life says mister Wegg again holding out mister Venus s palm as if he were going to tell his fortune by chiromancy and holding his own up ready for smiting it when the time should come
978-125137-0051	train-other-500	as one that the poet might have had his eye on in writing the national naval words Helm a weather now lay her close Yard arm and yard arm she lies Again cried I mister Venus give her t other dose Man shrouds and grapple sir or she flies
978-125137-0052	train-other-500	that is to say regarded in the light of true British Oak for such you are explain mister Venus the expression papers Seeing that the old gentleman was generally cutting off some near relation or blocking out some natural affection mister Venus rejoins
978-125137-0053	train-other-500	he most likely made a good many wills and codicils The palm of Silas Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm of Venus and Wegg lavishly exclaims Twin in opinion equally with feeling Mix a little more
none	none	 Having now hitched his wooden leg and his chair close in front of mister Venus mister Wegg rapidly mixes for both gives his visitor his glass touches its rim with the rim of his own puts his own to his lips puts it down and spreading his hands on his visitor s knees thus addresses him 
978-125137-0054	train-other-500	mister Venus It ain t that I object to being passed over for a stranger though I regard the stranger as a more than doubtful customer It ain t for the sake of making money though money is ever welcome It ain t for myself though I am not so haughty as to be above doing myself a good turn It s for the cause of the right
978-125137-0055	train-other-500	mister Venus passively winking his weak eyes both at once demands What is mister Wegg The friendly move sir that I now propose You see the move sir Till you have pointed it out mister Wegg I can t say whether I do or not
978-125137-0056	train-other-500	If there IS anything to be found on these premises let us find it together Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it together Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to share the profits of it equally betwixt us In the cause of the right Thus Silas assuming a noble air
none	none	 Then says mister Venus looking up after meditating with his hair held in his hands as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head if anything was to be unburied from under the dust 
978-125137-0057	train-other-500	it would be kept a secret by you and me
none	none	 Would that be it mister Wegg That would depend upon what it was mister Venus 
978-125137-0058	train-other-500	Say it was money or plate or jewellery it would be as much ours as anybody else s mister Venus rubs an eyebrow interrogatively In the cause of the right it would
none	none	 Because it would be unknowingly sold with the mounds else 
978-125137-0059	train-other-500	and the buyer would get what he was never meant to have and never bought And what would that be mister Venus but the cause of the wrong Say it was papers mister Venus propounds According to what they contained we should offer to dispose of em to the parties most interested
978-125137-0060	train-other-500	replies Wegg promptly In the cause of the right mister Wegg Always so mister Venus If the parties should use them in the cause of the wrong that would be their act and deed mister Venus I have an opinion of you sir to which it is not easy to give mouth
978-125137-0061	train-other-500	Since I called upon you that evening when you were as I may say floating your powerful mind in tea I have felt that you required to be roused with an object In this friendly move sir you will have a glorious object to rouse you
none	none	 mister Wegg then goes on to enlarge upon what throughout has been uppermost in his crafty mind 
978-125137-0062	train-other-500	the qualifications of mister Venus for such a search He expatiates on mister Venus s patient habits and delicate manipulation on his skill in piecing little things together on his knowledge of various tissues and textures
978-125137-0063	train-other-500	on the likelihood of small indications leading him on to the discovery of great concealments While as to myself says Wegg
none	none	 I am not good at it 
978-125137-0064	train-other-500	Whether I gave myself up to prodding or whether I gave myself up to scooping I couldn t do it with that delicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the mounds Quite different with YOU going to work as YOU would in the light of a fellow man holily pledged in a friendly move to his brother man
978-125137-0065	train-other-500	mister Wegg next modestly remarks on the want of adaptation in a wooden leg to ladders and such like airy perches and also hints at an inherent tendency in that timber fiction when called into action for the purposes of a promenade on an ashey slope
978-125137-0066	train-other-500	to stick itself into the yielding foothold and peg its owner to one spot Then leaving this part of the subject he remarks on the special phenomenon that before his installation in the Bower it was from mister Venus that he first heard of the legend of hidden wealth in the Mounds which
978-125137-0067	train-other-500	he observes with a vaguely pious air was surely never meant for nothing Lastly he returns to the cause of the right gloomily foreshadowing the possibility of something being unearthed to criminate mister Boffin
978-125137-0068	train-other-500	of whom he once more candidly admits it cannot be denied that he profits by a murder and anticipating his denunciation by the friendly movers to avenging justice And this mister Wegg expressly points out not at all for the sake of the reward
978-125137-0069	train-other-500	though it would be a want of principle not to take it To all this mister Venus with his shock of dusty hair cocked after the manner of a terrier s ears attends profoundly When mister Wegg having finished opens his arms wide as if to show mister Venus how bare his breast is
978-125137-0070	train-other-500	and then folds them pending a reply mister Venus winks at him with both eyes some little time before speaking I see you have tried it by yourself mister Wegg he says when he does speak You have found out the difficulties by experience
978-125137-0071	train-other-500	No it can hardly be said that I have tried it replies Wegg a little dashed by the hint
none	none	 I have just skimmed it 
978-125137-0072	train-other-500	Skimmed it And found nothing besides the difficulties Wegg shakes his head I scarcely know what to say to this mister Wegg
none	none	 observes Venus after ruminating for a while 
978-125137-0073	train-other-500	Say yes Wegg naturally urges If I wasn t soured my answer would be no
none	none	 But being soured mister Wegg and driven to reckless madness and desperation I suppose it s Yes 
978-125137-0074	train-other-500	Wegg joyfully reproduces the two glasses repeats the ceremony of clinking their rims and inwardly drinks with great heartiness to the health and success in life of the young lady who has reduced mister Venus to his present convenient state of mind The articles of the friendly move are then severally recited and agreed upon
978-125137-0075	train-other-500	They are but secrecy fidelity and perseverance The Bower to be always free of access to mister Venus for his researches and every precaution to be taken against their attracting observation in the neighbourhood There s a footstep exclaims Venus Where cries Wegg starting
none	none	 Outside saint They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move by shaking hands upon it 
978-125137-0076	train-other-500	They softly break off light their pipes which have gone out and lean back in their chairs No doubt a footstep It approaches the window and a hand taps at the glass Come in calls Wegg meaning come round by the door
978-125137-0077	train-other-500	But the heavy old fashioned sash is slowly raised and a head slowly looks in out of the dark background of night Pray is mister Silas Wegg here Oh I see him The friendly movers might not have been quite at their ease
978-125137-0078	train-other-500	even though the visitor had entered in the usual manner But leaning on the breast high window and staring in out of the darkness they find the visitor extremely embarrassing Especially mister Venus who removes his pipe draws back his head and stares at the starer as if it were his own Hindoo baby come to fetch him home
978-125137-0079	train-other-500	Good evening mister Wegg The yard gate lock should be looked to if you please it don t catch Is it mister Rokesmith falters Wegg It is mister Rokesmith Don t let me disturb you I am not coming in
978-125137-0080	train-other-500	I have only a message for you which I undertook to deliver on my way home to my lodgings I was in two minds about coming beyond the gate without ringing not knowing but you might have a dog about I wish I had mutters Wegg with his back turned as he rose from his chair
none	none	 saint 
978-125137-0081	train-other-500	Hush The talking over stranger mister Venus Is that any one I know inquires the staring Secretary No mister Rokesmith Friend of mine Passing the evening with me Oh I beg his pardon
978-125137-0082	train-other-500	mister Boffin wishes you to know that he does not expect you to stay at home any evening on the chance of his coming It has occurred to him that he may without intending it have been a tie upon you In future if he should come without notice he will take his chance of finding you
978-125137-0083	train-other-500	and it will be all the same to him if he does not I undertook to tell you on my way That s all With that and Good night the Secretary lowers the window and disappears They listen and hear his footsteps go back to the gate and hear the gate close after him
978-125137-0084	train-other-500	And for that individual mister Venus remarks Wegg when he is fully gone I have been passed over Let me ask you what you think of him
none	none	 Apparently mister Venus does not know what to think of him for he makes sundry efforts to reply without delivering himself of any other articulate utterance than that he has a 
978-125137-0085	train-other-500	singular look A double look you mean sir rejoins Wegg playing bitterly upon the word
none	none	 That s HIS look Any amount of singular look for me but not a double look That s an under handed mind sir Do you say there s something against him 
978-125137-0086	train-other-500	Venus asks Something against him repeats Wegg Something
none	none	 What would the relief be to my feelings as a fellow man if I wasn t the slave of truth and didn t feel myself compelled to answer 
978-125137-0087	train-other-500	Everything See into what wonderful maudlin refuges featherless ostriches plunge their heads It is such unspeakable moral compensation to Wegg to be overcome by the consideration that mister Rokesmith has an underhanded mind
978-125137-0088	train-other-500	On this starlight night mister Venus
none	none	 he remarks when he is showing that friendly mover out across the yard and both are something the worse for mixing again and again 
978-125137-0089	train-other-500	on this starlight night to think that talking over strangers and underhanded minds can go walking home under the sky as if they was all square The spectacle of those orbs says mister Venus gazing upward with his hat tumbling off
none	none	 brings heavy on me her crushing words that she did not wish to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that I know I know 
978-125137-0090	train-other-500	You needn t repeat em says Wegg pressing his hand But think how those stars steady me in the cause of the right against some that shall be nameless It isn t that I bear malice But see how they glisten with old remembrances
978-125137-0091	train-other-500	Old remembrances of what sir mister Venus begins drearily replying
none	none	 Of her words in her own handwriting that she does not wish to regard herself nor yet when Silas cuts him short with dignity No sir Remembrances of Our House of Master George of Aunt Jane of Uncle Parker all laid waste All offered up sacrifices to the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour Chapter eight IN WHICH AN INNOCENT ELOPEMENT OCCURS The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour or in less cutting language Nicodemus Boffin Esquire the Golden Dustman had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he was likely ever to be He could not but feel that like an eminently aristocratic family cheese it was much too large for his wants and bred an infinite amount of parasites but he was content to regard this drawback on his property as a sort of perpetual Legacy Duty He felt the more resigned to it forasmuch as missus Boffin enjoyed herself completely and Miss Bella was delighted That young lady was no doubt an acquisition to the Boffins She was far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere and far too quick of perception to be below the tone of her new career Whether it improved her heart might be a matter of taste that was open to question but as touching another matter of taste its improvement of her appearance and manner there could be no question whatever And thus it soon came about that Miss Bella began to set missus Boffin right and even further that Miss Bella began to feel ill at ease and as it were responsible when she saw missus Boffin going wrong Not that so sweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even among the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were charmingly vulgar which for certain was not their own case in saying so but that when she made a slip on the social ice on which all the children of Podsnappery with genteel souls to be saved are required to skate in circles or to slide in long rows she inevitably tripped Miss Bella up so that young lady felt and caused her to experience great confusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in those ice exercises At Miss Bella s time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in mister Boffin s house And as she had never been sparing of complaints of her old home when she had no other to compare it with so there was no novelty of ingratitude or disdain in her very much preferring her new one An invaluable man is Rokesmith said mister Boffin after some two or three months But I can t quite make him out Neither could Bella so she found the subject rather interesting He takes more care of my affairs morning noon and night said mister Boffin than fifty other men put together either could or would and yet he has ways of his own that are like tying a scaffolding pole right across the road and bringing me up short when I am almost a walking arm in arm with him May I ask how so sir inquired Bella Well my dear said mister Boffin he won t meet any company here but you When we have visitors I should wish him to have his regular place at the table like ourselves but no he won t take it If he considers himself above it said Miss Bella with an airy toss of her head I should leave him alone It ain t that my dear replied mister Boffin thinking it over He don t consider himself above it Perhaps he considers himself beneath it suggested Bella If so he ought to know best No my dear nor it ain t that neither No repeated mister Boffin with a shake of his head after again thinking it over Rokesmith s a modest man but he don t consider himself beneath it Then what does he consider sir asked Bella Dashed if I know said mister Boffin It seemed at first as if it was only Lightwood that he objected to meet And now it seems to be everybody except you Oho thought Miss Bella In deed That s it is it For mister Mortimer Lightwood had dined there two or three times and she had met him elsewhere and he had shown her some attention Rather cool in a Secretary and Pa s lodger to make me the subject of his jealousy That Pa s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa s lodger was odd but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl spoilt first by poverty and then by wealth Be it this history s part however to leave them to unravel themselves A little too much I think Miss Bella reflected scornfully to have Pa s lodger laying claim to me and keeping eligible people off A little too much indeed to have the opportunities opened to me by mister and missus Boffin appropriated by a mere Secretary and Pa s lodger Yet it was not so very long ago that Bella had been fluttered by the discovery that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like her Ah but the eminently aristocratic mansion and missus Boffin s dressmaker had not come into play then In spite of his seemingly retiring manners a very intrusive person this Secretary and lodger in Miss Bella s opinion Always a light in his office room when we came home from the play or Opera and he always at the carriage door to hand us out Always a provoking radiance too on missus Boffin s face and an abominably cheerful reception of him as if it were possible seriously to approve what the man had in his mind You never charge me Miss Wilfer said the Secretary encountering her by chance alone in the great drawing room with commissions for home I shall always be happy to execute any commands you may have in that direction Pray what may you mean mister Rokesmith inquired Miss Bella with languidly drooping eyelids By home I mean your father s house at Holloway She coloured under the retort so skilfully thrust that the words seemed to be merely a plain answer given in plain good faith and said rather more emphatically and sharply What commissions and commands are you speaking of Only little words of remembrance as I assume you sent somehow or other replied the Secretary with his former air It would be a pleasure to me if you would make me the bearer of them As you know I come and go between the two houses every day You needn t remind me of that sir She was too quick in this petulant sally against Pa s lodger and she felt that she had been so when she met his quiet look They don t send many what was your expression words of remembrance to me said Bella making haste to take refuge in ill usage They frequently ask me about you and I give them such slight intelligence as I can I hope it s truly given exclaimed Bella I hope you cannot doubt it for it would be very much against you if you could No I do not doubt it I deserve the reproach which is very just indeed I beg your pardon mister Rokesmith I should beg you not to do so but that it shows you to such admirable advantage he replied with earnestness Forgive me I could not help saying that To return to what I have digressed from let me add that perhaps they think I report them to you deliver little messages and the like But I forbear to trouble you as you never ask me I am going sir said Bella looking at him as if he had reproved her to see them tomorrow Is that he asked hesitating said to me or to them To which you please To both Shall I make it a message You can if you like mister Rokesmith Message or no message I am going to see them tomorrow Then I will tell them so He lingered a moment as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if she wished As she remained silent he left her Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Bella herself when alone again to be very curious The first was that he unquestionably left her with a penitent air upon her and a penitent feeling in her heart The second was that she had not an intention or a thought of going home until she had announced it to him as a settled design What can I mean by it or what can he mean by it was her mental inquiry He has no right to any power over me and how do I come to mind him when I don t care for him missus Boffin insisting that Bella should make tomorrow s expedition in the chariot she went home in great grandeur missus Wilfer and Miss Lavinia had speculated much on the probabilities and improbabilities of her coming in this gorgeous state and on beholding the chariot from the window at which they were secreted to look out for it agreed that it must be detained at the door as long as possible for the mortification and confusion of the neighbours Then they repaired to the usual family room to receive Miss Bella with a becoming show of indifference The family room looked very small and very mean and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked The little house and all its arrangements were a poor contrast to the eminently aristocratic dwelling I can hardly believe thought Bella that I ever did endure life in this place Gloomy majesty on the part of missus Wilfer and native pertness on the part of Lavvy did not mend the matter Bella really stood in natural need of a little help and she got none This said missus Wilfer presenting a cheek to be kissed as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon is quite an honour You will probably find your sister Lavvy grown Bella Ma Miss Lavinia interposed there can be no objection to your being aggravating because Bella richly deserves it but I really must request that you will not drag in such ridiculous nonsense as my having grown when I am past the growing age I grew myself missus Wilfer sternly proclaimed after I was married Very well Ma returned Lavvy then I think you had much better have left it alone The lofty glare with which the majestic woman received this answer might have embarrassed a less pert opponent but it had no effect upon Lavinia who leaving her parent to the enjoyment of any amount of glaring at she might deem desirable under the circumstances accosted her sister undismayed I suppose you won t consider yourself quite disgraced Bella if I give you a kiss Well And how do you do Bella And how are your Boffins Peace exclaimed missus Wilfer Hold I will not suffer this tone of levity My goodness me How are your Spoffins then said Lavvy since Ma so very much objects to your Boffins Impertinent girl Minx said missus Wilfer with dread severity I don t care whether I am a Minx or a Sphinx returned Lavinia coolly tossing her head it s exactly the same thing to me and I d every bit as soon be one as the other but I know this I ll not grow after I m married You will not YOU will not repeated missus Wilfer solemnly No Ma I will not Nothing shall induce me missus Wilfer having waved her gloves became loftily pathetic But it was to be expected thus she spake A child of mine deserts me for the proud and prosperous and another child of mine despises me It is quite fitting Ma Bella struck in mister and missus Boffin are prosperous no doubt but you have no right to say they are proud You must know very well that they are not In short Ma said Lavvy bouncing over to the enemy without a word of notice you must know very well or if you don t more shame for you that mister and missus Boffin are just absolute perfection Truly returned missus Wilfer courteously receiving the deserter it would seem that we are required to think so And this Lavinia is my reason for objecting to a tone of levity missus Boffin of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to preserve and your mother are not on terms of intimacy It is not for a moment to be supposed that she and her husband dare to presume to speak of this family as the Wilfers I cannot therefore condescend to speak of them as the Boffins No for such a tone call it familiarity levity equality or what you will would imply those social interchanges which do not exist Do I render myself intelligible Without taking the least notice of this inquiry albeit delivered in an imposing and forensic manner Lavinia reminded her sister After all you know Bella you haven t told us how your Whatshisnames are I don t want to speak of them here replied Bella suppressing indignation and tapping her foot on the floor They are much too kind and too good to be drawn into these discussions Why put it so demanded missus Wilfer with biting sarcasm Why adopt a circuitous form of speech It is polite and it is obliging but why do it Why not openly say that they are much too kind and too good for US We understand the allusion Why disguise the phrase Ma said Bella with one beat of her foot you are enough to drive a saint mad and so is Lavvy Unfortunate Lavvy cried missus Wilfer in a tone of commiseration She always comes for it My poor child But Lavvy with the suddenness of her former desertion now bounced over to the other enemy very sharply remarking Don t patronize ME Ma because I can take care of myself I only wonder resumed missus Wilfer directing her observations to her elder daughter as safer on the whole than her utterly unmanageable younger that you found time and inclination to tear yourself from mister and missus Boffin and come to see us at all I only wonder that our claims contending against the superior claims of mister and missus Boffin had any weight I feel I ought to be thankful for gaining so much in competition with mister and missus Boffin The good lady bitterly emphasized the first letter of the word Boffin as if it represented her chief objection to the owners of that name and as if she could have born Doffin Moffin or Poffin much better Ma said Bella angrily you force me to say that I am truly sorry I did come home and that I never will come home again except when poor dear Pa is here For Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite towards my generous friends and Pa is delicate enough and gentle enough to remember the sort of little claim they thought I had upon them and the unusually trying position in which through no act of my own I had been placed And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest of you put together and I always do and I always shall Here Bella deriving no comfort from her charming bonnet and her elegant dress burst into tears I think R W cried missus Wilfer lifting up her eyes and apostrophising the air that if you were present it would be a trial to your feelings to hear your wife and the mother of your family depreciated in your name But Fate has spared you this R W whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her Here missus Wilfer burst into tears I hate the Boffins protested Miss Lavinia I don t care who objects to their being called the Boffins I WILL call em the Boffins The Boffins the Boffins the Boffins And I say they are mischief making Boffins and I say the Boffins have set Bella against me and I tell the Boffins to their faces which was not strictly the fact but the young lady was excited that they are detestable Boffins disreputable Boffins odious Boffins beastly Boffins There Here Miss Lavinia burst into tears The front garden gate clanked and the Secretary was seen coming at a brisk pace up the steps Leave Me to open the door to him said missus Wilfer rising with stately resignation as she shook her head and dried her eyes we have at present no stipendiary girl to do so We have nothing to conceal If he sees these traces of emotion on our cheeks let him construe them as he may With those words she stalked out In a few moments she stalked in again proclaiming in her heraldic manner mister Rokesmith is the bearer of a packet for Miss Bella Wilfer mister Rokesmith followed close upon his name and of course saw what was amiss But he discreetly affected to see nothing and addressed Miss Bella mister Boffin intended to have placed this in the carriage for you this morning He wished you to have it as a little keepsake he had prepared it is only a purse Miss Wilfer but as he was disappointed in his fancy I volunteered to come after you with it Bella took it in her hand and thanked him We have been quarrelling here a little mister Rokesmith but not more than we used you know our agreeable ways among ourselves You find me just going Good bye mamma Good bye Lavvy and with a kiss for each Miss Bella turned to the door The Secretary would have attended her but missus Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity Pardon me Permit me to assert my natural right to escort my child to the equipage which is in waiting for her he begged pardon and gave place It was a very magnificent spectacle indeed to see missus Wilfer throw open the house door and loudly demand with extended gloves The male domestic of missus Boffin To whom presenting himself she delivered the brief but majestic charge Miss Wilfer Coming out and so delivered her over like a female Lieutenant of the Tower relinquishing a State Prisoner The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step When Bella was seated in the carriage she opened the little packet in her hand It contained a pretty purse and the purse contained a bank note for fifty pounds This shall be a joyful surprise for poor dear Pa said Bella and I ll take it myself into the City As she was uninformed respecting the exact locality of the place of business of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles but knew it to be near Mincing Lane she directed herself to be driven to the corner of that darksome spot Thence she despatched the male domestic of missus Boffin in search of the counting house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles with a message importing that if R Wilfer could come out there was a lady waiting who would be glad to speak with him The delivery of these mysterious words from the mouth of a footman caused so great an excitement in the counting house that a youthful scout was instantly appointed to follow Rumty observe the lady and come in with his report Nor was the agitation by any means diminished when the scout rushed back with the intelligence that the lady was a slap up gal in a bang up chariot Rumty himself with his pen behind his ear under his rusty hat arrived at the carriage door in a breathless condition and had been fairly lugged into the vehicle by his cravat and embraced almost unto choking before he recognized his daughter My dear child he then panted incoherently Good gracious me What a lovely woman you are I thought you had been unkind and forgotten your mother and sister I have just been to see them Pa dear Oh and how how did you find your mother asked R W dubiously Very disagreeable Pa and so was Lavvy They are sometimes a little liable to it observed the patient cherub but I hope you made allowances Bella my dear No I was disagreeable too Pa we were all of us disagreeable together But I want you to come and dine with me somewhere Pa Why my dear I have already partaken of a if one might mention such an article in this superb chariot of a Saveloy replied R Wilfer modestly dropping his voice on the word as he eyed the canary coloured fittings Oh That s nothing Pa Truly it ain t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be my dear he admitted drawing his hand across his mouth Still when circumstances over which you have no control interpose obstacles between yourself and Small Germans you can t do better than bring a contented mind to hear on again dropping his voice in deference to the chariot Saveloys You poor good Pa Pa do I beg and pray get leave for the rest of the day and come and pass it with me Well my dear I ll cut back and ask for leave But before you cut back said Bella who had already taken him by the chin pulled his hat off and begun to stick up his hair in her old way do say that you are sure I am giddy and inconsiderate but have never really slighted you Pa My dear I say it with all my heart And might I likewise observe her father delicately hinted with a glance out at window that perhaps it might be calculated to attract attention having one s hair publicly done by a lovely woman in an elegant turn out in Fenchurch Street Bella laughed and put on his hat again But when his boyish figure bobbed away its shabbiness and cheerful patience smote the tears out of her eyes I hate that Secretary for thinking it of me she said to herself and yet it seems half true Back came her father more like a boy than ever in his release from school All right my dear Leave given at once Really very handsomely done Now where can we find some quiet place Pa in which I can wait for you while you go on an errand for me if I send the carriage away It demanded cogitation You see my dear he explained you really have become such a very lovely woman that it ought to be a very quiet place At length he suggested Near the garden up by the Trinity House on Tower Hill So they were driven there and Bella dismissed the chariot sending a pencilled note by it to missus Boffin that she was with her father Now Pa attend to what I am going to say and promise and vow to be obedient I promise and vow my dear You ask no questions You take this purse you go to the nearest place where they keep everything of the very very best ready made you buy and put on the most beautiful suit of clothes the most beautiful hat and the most beautiful pair of bright boots patent leather Pa mind that are to be got for money and you come back to me But my dear Bella Take care Pa pointing her forefinger at him merrily You have promised and vowed It s perjury you know There was water in the foolish little fellow s eyes but she kissed them dry though her own were wet and he bobbed away again After half an hour he came back so brilliantly transformed that Bella was obliged to walk round him in ecstatic admiration twenty times before she could draw her arm through his and delightedly squeeze it Now Pa said Bella hugging him close take this lovely woman out to dinner Where shall we go my dear Greenwich said Bella valiantly And be sure you treat this lovely woman with everything of the best While they were going along to take boat Don t you wish my dear said R W timidly that your mother was here No I don t Pa for I like to have you all to myself to day I was always your little favourite at home and you were always mine We have run away together often before now haven t we Pa Ah to be sure we have Many a Sunday when your mother was was a little liable to it repeating his former delicate expression after pausing to cough Yes and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been Pa I made you carry me over and over again when you should have made me walk and I often drove you in harness when you would much rather have sat down and read your news paper didn t I Sometimes sometimes But Lor what a child you were What a companion you were Companion That s just what I want to be to day Pa You are safe to succeed my love Your brothers and sisters have all in their turns been companions to me to a certain extent but only to a certain extent Your mother has throughout life been a companion that any man might might look up to and and commit the sayings of to memory and form himself upon if he If he liked the model suggested Bella We ell ye es he returned thinking about it not quite satisfied with the phrase or perhaps I might say if it was in him Supposing for instance that a man wanted to be always marching he would find your mother an inestimable companion But if he had any taste for walking or should wish at any time to break into a trot he might sometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother Or take it this way Bella he added after a moment s reflection Supposing that a man had to go through life we won t say with a companion but we ll say to a tune Very good Supposing that the tune allotted to him was the Dead March in Saul Well It would be a very suitable tune for particular occasions none better but it would be difficult to keep time with in the ordinary run of domestic transactions For instance if he took his supper after a hard day to the Dead March in Saul his food might be likely to sit heavy on him Or if he was at any time inclined to relieve his mind by singing a comic song or dancing a hornpipe and was obliged to do it to the Dead March in Saul he might find himself put out in the execution of his lively intentions Poor Pa thought Bella as she hung upon his arm Now what I will say for you my dear the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining is that you are so adaptable So adaptable Indeed I am afraid I have shown a wretched temper Pa I am afraid I have been very complaining and very capricious I seldom or never thought of it before But when I sat in the carriage just now and saw you coming along the pavement I reproached myself Not at all my dear Don t speak of such a thing A happy and a chatty man was Pa in his new clothes that day Take it for all in all it was perhaps the happiest day he had ever known in his life not even excepting that on which his heroic partner had approached the nuptial altar to the tune of the Dead March in Saul The little expedition down the river was delightful and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful Everything was delightful The park was delightful the punch was delightful the dishes of fish were delightful the wine was delightful Bella was more delightful than any other item in the festival drawing Pa out in the gayest manner making a point of always mentioning herself as the lovely woman stimulating Pa to order things by declaring that the lovely woman insisted on being treated with them and in short causing Pa to be quite enraptured with the consideration that he WAS the Pa of such a charming daughter And then as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making their way to the sea with the tide that was running down the lovely woman imagined all sorts of voyages for herself and Pa Now Pa in the character of owner of a lumbering square sailed collier was tacking away to Newcastle to fetch black diamonds to make his fortune with now Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship to bring home opium with which he would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the decoration of his charming daughter Now John Harmon s disastrous fate was all a dream and he had come home and found the lovely woman just the article for him and the lovely woman had found him just the article for her and they were going away on a trip in their gallant bark to look after their vines with streamers flying at all points a band playing on deck and Pa established in the great cabin Now John Harmon was consigned to his grave again and a merchant of immense wealth name unknown had courted and married the lovely woman and he was so enormously rich that everything you saw upon the river sailing or steaming belonged to him and he kept a perfect fleet of yachts for pleasure and that little impudent yacht which you saw over there with the great white sail was called The Bella in honour of his wife and she held her state aboard when it pleased her like a modern Cleopatra Anon there would embark in that troop ship when she got to Gravesend a mighty general of large property name also unknown who wouldn t hear of going to victory without his wife and whose wife was the lovely woman and she was destined to become the idol of all the red coats and blue jackets alow and aloft And then again you saw that ship being towed out by a steam tug Well where did you suppose she was going to She was going among the coral reefs and cocoa nuts and all that sort of thing and she was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name of Pa himself on board and much respected by all hands and she was going for his sole profit and advantage to fetch a cargo of sweet smelling woods the most beautiful that ever were seen and the most profitable that ever were heard of and her cargo would be a great fortune as indeed it ought to be the lovely woman who had purchased her and fitted her expressly for this voyage being married to an Indian Prince who was a Something or Other and who wore Cashmere shawls all over himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in his turban and was beautifully coffee coloured and excessively devoted though a little too jealous Thus Bella ran on merrily in a manner perfectly enchanting to Pa who was as willing to put his head into the Sultan s tub of water as the beggar boys below the window were to put THEIR heads in the mud I suppose my dear said Pa after dinner we may come to the conclusion at home that we have lost you for good Bella shook her head Didn t know Couldn t say All she was able to report was that she was most handsomely supplied with everything she could possibly want and that whenever she hinted at leaving mister and missus Boffin they wouldn t hear of it And now Pa pursued Bella I ll make a confession to you I am the most mercenary little wretch that ever lived in the world I should hardly have thought it of you my dear returned her father first glancing at himself and then at the dessert I understand what you mean Pa but it s not that It s not that I care for money to keep as money but I do care so much for what it will buy Really I think most of us do returned R W But not to the dreadful extent that I do Pa O o cried Bella screwing the exclamation out of herself with a twist of her dimpled chin I AM so mercenary With a wistful glance R W said in default of having anything better to say About when did you begin to feel it coming on my dear That s it Pa That s the terrible part of it When I was at home and only knew what it was to be poor I grumbled but didn t so much mind When I was at home expecting to be rich I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do But when I had been disappointed of my splendid fortune and came to see it from day to day in other hands and to have before my eyes what it could really do then I became the mercenary little wretch I am It s your fancy my dear I can assure you it s nothing of the sort Pa said Bella nodding at him with her very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go and looking comically frightened It s a fact I am always avariciously scheming Lor But how I ll tell you Pa I don t mind telling YOU because we have always been favourites of each other s and because you are not like a Pa but more like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness on him And besides added Bella laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face because I have got you in my power This is a secret expedition If ever you tell of me I ll tell of you I ll tell Ma that you dined at Greenwich Well seriously my dear observed R W with some trepidation of manner it might be as well not to mention it Aha laughed Bella I knew you wouldn t like it sir So you keep my confidence and I ll keep yours But betray the lovely woman and you shall find her a serpent Now you may give me a kiss Pa and I should like to give your hair a turn because it has been dreadfully neglected in my absence R W submitted his head to the operator and the operator went on talking at the same time putting separate locks of his hair through a curious process of being smartly rolled over her two revolving forefingers which were then suddenly pulled out of it in opposite lateral directions On each of these occasions the patient winced and winked I have made up my mind that I must have money Pa I feel that I can t beg it borrow it or steal it and so I have resolved that I must marry it R W cast up his eyes towards her as well as he could under the operating circumstances and said in a tone of remonstrance My de ar Bella Have resolved I say Pa that to get money I must marry money In consequence of which I am always looking out for money to captivate My de a r Bella Yes Pa that is the state of the case If ever there was a mercenary plotter whose thoughts and designs were always in her mean occupation I am the amiable creature But I don t care I hate and detest being poor and I won t be poor if I can marry money Now you are deliciously fluffy Pa and in a state to astonish the waiter and pay the bill But my dear Bella this is quite alarming at your age I told you so Pa but you wouldn t believe it returned Bella with a pleasant childish gravity Isn t it shocking It would be quite so if you fully knew what you said my dear or meant it Well Pa I can only tell you that I mean nothing else Talk to me of love said Bella contemptuously though her face and figure certainly rendered the subject no incongruous one Talk to me of fiery dragons But talk to me of poverty and wealth and there indeed we touch upon realities My De ar this is becoming Awful her father was emphatically beginning when she stopped him Pa tell me Did you marry money You know I didn t my dear Bella hummed the Dead March in Saul and said after all it signified very little But seeing him look grave and downcast she took him round the neck and kissed him back to cheerfulness again I didn t mean that last touch Pa it was only said in joke Now mind You are not to tell of me and I ll not tell of you And more than that I promise to have no secrets from you Pa and you may make certain that whatever mercenary things go on I shall always tell you all about them in strict confidence Fain to be satisfied with this concession from the lovely woman R W rang the bell and paid the bill Now all the rest of this Pa said Bella rolling up the purse when they were alone again hammering it small with her little fist on the table and cramming it into one of the pockets of his new waistcoat is for you to buy presents with for them at home and to pay bills with and to divide as you like and spend exactly as you think proper Last of all take notice Pa that it s not the fruit of any avaricious scheme Perhaps if it was your little mercenary wretch of a daughter wouldn t make so free with it After which she tugged at his coat with both hands and pulled him all askew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket and then tied her dimples into her bonnet strings in a very knowing way and took him back to London Arrived at mister Boffin s door she set him with his back against it tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles for her purpose and kissed him until he knocked muffled double knocks at the door with the back of his head That done she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him Not so gaily however but that tears filled her eyes as he went away down the dark street Not so gaily but that she several times said Ah poor little Pa Ah poor dear struggling shabby little Pa before she took heart to knock at the door Not so gaily but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home Not so gaily but that she fell into very low spirits sitting late in her own room and very heartily wept as she wished now that the deceased old John Harmon had never made a will about her now that the deceased young John Harmon had lived to marry her Contradictory things to wish said Bella but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that what can I expect myself to be Chapter nine IN WHICH THE ORPHAN MAKES HIS WILL The Secretary working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy The footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause before uttering the name to express that it was forced on his reluctance by the youth in question and that if the youth had had the good sense and good taste to inherit some other name it would have spared the feelings of him the bearer missus Boffin will be very well pleased said the Secretary in a perfectly composed way Show him in mister Sloppy being introduced remained close to the door revealing in various parts of his form many surprising confounding and incomprehensible buttons I am glad to see you said John Rokesmith in a cheerful tone of welcome I have been expecting you Sloppy explained that he had meant to come before but that the Orphan of whom he made mention as Our Johnny had been ailing and he had waited to report him well Then he is well now said the Secretary No he ain t said Sloppy mister Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny must have took em from the Minders Being asked what he meant he answered them that come out upon him and partickler his chest Being requested to explain himself he stated that there was some of em wot you couldn t kiver with a sixpence Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case he opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be But as long as they strikes out ards sir continued Sloppy they ain t so much It s their striking in ards that s to be kep off John Rokesmith hoped the child had had medical attendance Oh yes said Sloppy he had been took to the doctor s shop once And what did the doctor call it Rokesmith asked him After some perplexed reflection Sloppy answered brightening He called it something as wos wery long for spots Rokesmith suggested measles No said Sloppy with confidence ever so much longer than THEM sir mister Sloppy was elevated by this fact and seemed to consider that it reflected credit on the poor little patient missus Boffin will be sorry to hear this said Rokesmith missus Higden said so sir when she kep it from her hoping as Our Johnny would work round But I hope he will said Rokesmith with a quick turn upon the messenger I hope so answered Sloppy It all depends on their striking in ards He then went on to say that whether Johnny had took em from the Minders or whether the Minders had took em from Johnny the Minders had been sent home and had got em Furthermore that missus Higden s days and nights being devoted to Our Johnny who was never out of her lap the whole of the mangling arrangements had devolved upon himself and he had had rayther a tight time The ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as he said it quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable Last night said Sloppy when I was a turning at the wheel pretty late the mangle seemed to go like Our Johnny s breathing It begun beautiful then as it went out it shook a little and got unsteady then as it took the turn to come home it had a rattle like and lumbered a bit then it come smooth and so it went on till I scarce know d which was mangle and which was Our Johnny Nor Our Johnny he scarce know d either for sometimes when the mangle lumbers he says Me choking Granny and missus Higden holds him up in her lap and says to me Bide a bit Sloppy and we all stops together And when Our Johnny gets his breathing again I turns again and we all goes on together Sloppy had gradually expanded with his description into a stare and a vacant grin He now contracted being silent into a half repressed gush of tears and under pretence of being heated drew the under part of his sleeve across his eyes with a singularly awkward laborious and roundabout smear This is unfortunate said Rokesmith I must go and break it to missus Boffin Stay you here Sloppy Sloppy stayed there staring at the pattern of the paper on the wall until the Secretary and missus Boffin came back together And with missus Boffin was a young lady Miss Bella Wilfer by name who was better worth staring at it occurred to Sloppy than the best of wall papering Ah my poor dear pretty little John Harmon exclaimed missus Boffin
1027_125140_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes mum 
1027_125140_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes mum 
none	none	said the sympathetic Sloppy You don t think he is in a very very bad way do you asked the pleasant creature with her wholesome cordiality Put upon his good faith and finding it in collision with his inclinations Sloppy threw back his head and uttered a mellifluous howl rounded off with a sniff So bad as that cried missus Boffin And Betty Higden not to tell me of it sooner I think she might have been mistrustful mum answered Sloppy hesitating Of what for Heaven s sake I think she might have been mistrustful mum returned Sloppy with submission of standing in Our Johnny s light There s so much trouble in illness and so much expense and she s seen such a lot of its being objected to But she never can have thought said missus Boffin that I would grudge the dear child anything
1027_125140_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 No mum 
none	none	but she might have thought as a habit like of its standing in Johnny s light and might have tried to bring him through it unbeknownst Sloppy knew his ground well To conceal herself in sickness like a lower animal to creep out of sight and coil herself away and die had become this woman s instinct To catch up in her arms the sick child who was dear to her and hide it as if it were a criminal and keep off all ministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply had become this woman s idea of maternal love fidelity and duty The shameful accounts we read every week in the Christian year my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards the infamous records of small official inhumanity do not pass by the people as they pass by us And hence these irrational blind and obstinate prejudices so astonishing to our magnificence and having no more reason in them God save the Queen and Confound their politics no than smoke has in coming from fire It s not a right place for the poor child to stay in said missus Boffin Tell us dear mister Rokesmith what to do for the best He had already thought what to do and the consultation was very short He could pave the way he said in half an hour and then they would go down to Brentford Pray take me said Bella Therefore a carriage was ordered of capacity to take them all and in the meantime Sloppy was regaled feasting alone in the Secretary s room with a complete realization of that fairy vision meat beer vegetables and pudding In consequence of which his buttons became more importunate of public notice than before with the exception of two or three about the region of the waistband which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement Punctual to the time appeared the carriage and the Secretary He sat on the box and mister Sloppy graced the rumble So to the Three Magpies as before where missus Boffin and Miss Bella were handed out and whence they all went on foot to missus Betty Higden s But on the way down they had stopped at a toy shop and had bought that noble charger a description of whose points and trappings had on the last occasion conciliated the then worldly minded orphan and also a Noah s ark and also a yellow bird with an artificial voice in him and also a military doll so well dressed that if he had only been of life size his brother officers in the Guards might never have found him out Bearing these gifts they raised the latch of Betty Higden s door and saw her sitting in the dimmest and furthest corner with poor Johnny in her lap And how s my boy Betty asked missus Boffin sitting down beside her He s bad He s bad said Betty I begin to be afeerd he ll not be yours any more than mine All others belonging to him have gone to the Power and the Glory and I have a mind that they re drawing him to them leading him away No no no said missus Boffin I don t know why else he clenches his little hand as if it had hold of a finger that I can t see Look at it said Betty opening the wrappers in which the flushed child lay and showing his small right hand lying closed upon his breast It s always so It don t mind me Is he asleep No I think not You re not asleep my Johnny No said Johnny with a quiet air of pity for himself and without opening his eyes Here s the lady Johnny And the horse Johnny could bear the lady with complete indifference but not the horse Opening his heavy eyes he slowly broke into a smile on beholding that splendid phenomenon and wanted to take it in his arms As it was much too big it was put upon a chair where he could hold it by the mane and contemplate it Which he soon forgot to do But Johnny murmuring something with his eyes closed and missus Boffin not knowing what old Betty bent her ear to listen and took pains to understand Being asked by her to repeat what he had said he did so two or three times and then it came out that he must have seen more than they supposed when he looked up to see the horse for the murmur was Who is the boofer lady Now the boofer or beautiful lady was Bella and whereas this notice from the poor baby would have touched her of itself it was rendered more pathetic by the late melting of her heart to her poor little father and their joke about the lovely woman So Bella s behaviour was very tender and very natural when she kneeled on the brick floor to clasp the child and when the child with a child s admiration of what is young and pretty fondled the boofer lady Now my good dear Betty said missus Boffin hoping that she saw her opportunity and laying her hand persuasively on her arm we have come to remove Johnny from this cottage to where he can be taken better care of Instantly and before another word could be spoken the old woman started up with blazing eyes and rushed at the door with the sick child Stand away from me every one of ye she cried out wildly I see what ye mean now Let me go my way all of ye I d sooner kill the Pretty and kill myself Stay stay said Rokesmith soothing her You don t understand I understand too well I know too much about it sir I ve run from it too many a year No Never for me nor for the child while there s water enough in England to cover us The terror the shame the passion of horror and repugnance firing the worn face and perfectly maddening it would have been a quite terrible sight if embodied in one old fellow creature alone Yet it crops up as our slang goes my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards in other fellow creatures rather frequently It s been chasing me all my life but it shall never take me nor mine alive cried old Betty I ve done with ye I d have fastened door and window and starved out afore I d ever have let ye in if I had known what ye came for But catching sight of missus Boffin s wholesome face she relented and crouching down by the door and bending over her burden to hush it said humbly Maybe my fears has put me wrong If they have so tell me and the good Lord forgive me I m quick to take this fright I know and my head is summ at light with wearying and watching There there there returned missus Boffin Come come Say no more of it Betty It was a mistake a mistake Any one of us might have made it in your place and felt just as you do The Lord bless ye said the old woman stretching out her hand Now see Betty pursued the sweet compassionate soul holding the hand kindly what I really did mean and what I should have begun by saying out if I had only been a little wiser and handier We want to move Johnny to a place where there are none but children a place set up on purpose for sick children where the good doctors and nurses pass their lives with children talk to none but children touch none but children comfort and cure none but children Is there really such a place asked the old woman with a gaze of wonder Yes Betty on my word and you shall see it If my home was a better place for the dear boy I d take him to it but indeed indeed it s not You shall take him returned Betty fervently kissing the comforting hand where you will my deary I am not so hard but that I believe your face and voice and I will as long as I can see and hear This victory gained Rokesmith made haste to profit by it for he saw how woefully time had been lost He despatched Sloppy to bring the carriage to the door caused the child to be carefully wrapped up bade old Betty get her bonnet on collected the toys enabling the little fellow to comprehend that his treasures were to be transported with him and had all things prepared so easily that they were ready for the carriage as soon as it appeared and in a minute afterwards were on their way Sloppy they left behind relieving his overcharged breast with a paroxysm of mangling At the Children s Hospital the gallant steed the Noah s ark yellow bird and the officer in the Guards were made as welcome as their child owner But the doctor said aside to Rokesmith This should have been days ago Too late However they were all carried up into a fresh airy room and there Johnny came to himself out of a sleep or a swoon or whatever it was to find himself lying in a little quiet bed with a little platform over his breast on which were already arranged to give him heart and urge him to cheer up the Noah s ark the noble steed and the yellow bird with the officer in the Guards doing duty over the whole quite as much to the satisfaction of his country as if he had been upon Parade And at the bed s head was a coloured picture beautiful to see representing as it were another Johnny seated on the knee of some Angel surely who loved little children And marvellous fact to lie and stare at Johnny had become one of a little family all in little quiet beds except two playing dominoes in little arm chairs at a little table on the hearth and on all the little beds were little platforms whereon were to be seen dolls houses woolly dogs with mechanical barks in them not very dissimilar from the artificial voice pervading the bowels of the yellow bird tin armies Moorish tumblers wooden tea things and the riches of the earth As Johnny murmured something in his placid admiration the ministering women at his bed s head asked him what he said It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his So they told him yes It seemed then that he wanted to know whether God had brought them all together there So they told him yes again They made out then that he wanted to know whether they would all get out of pain So they answered yes to that question likewise and made him understand that the reply included himself Johnny s powers of sustaining conversation were as yet so very imperfectly developed even in a state of health that in sickness they were little more than monosyllabic But he had to be washed and tended and remedies were applied and though those offices were far far more skilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for him in his little life so rough and short they would have hurt and tired him but for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of his attention This was no less than the appearance on his own little platform in pairs of All Creation on its way into his own particular ark the elephant leading and the fly with a diffident sense of his size politely bringing up the rear A very little brother lying in the next bed with a broken leg was so enchanted by this spectacle that his delight exalted its enthralling interest and so came rest and sleep I see you are not afraid to leave the dear child here Betty whispered missus Boffin No ma am Most willingly most thankfully with all my heart and soul So they kissed him and left him there and old Betty was to come back early in the morning and nobody but Rokesmith knew for certain how that the doctor had said This should have been days ago Too late But Rokesmith knowing it and knowing that his bearing it in mind would be acceptable thereafter to that good woman who had been the only light in the childhood of desolate John Harmon dead and gone resolved that late at night he would go back to the bedside of John Harmon s namesake and see how it fared with him The family whom God had brought together were not all asleep but were all quiet From bed to bed a light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh face passed in the silence of the night A little head would lift itself up into the softened light here and there to be kissed as the face went by for these little patients are very loving and would then submit itself to be composed to rest again The mite with the broken leg was restless and moaned but after a while turned his face towards Johnny s bed to fortify himself with a view of the ark and fell asleep Over most of the beds the toys were yet grouped as the children had left them when they last laid themselves down and in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity they might have stood for the children s dreams The doctor came in too to see how it fared with Johnny And he and Rokesmith stood together looking down with compassion on him What is it Johnny Rokesmith was the questioner and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle Him said the little fellow Those The doctor was quick to understand children and taking the horse the ark the yellow bird and the man in the Guards from Johnny s bed softly placed them on that of his next neighbour the mite with the broken leg With a weary and yet a pleased smile and with an action as if he stretched his little figure out to rest the child heaved his body on the sustaining arm and seeking Rokesmith s face with his lips said A kiss for the boofer lady Having now bequeathed all he had to dispose of and arranged his affairs in this world Johnny thus speaking left it Chapter ten A SUCCESSOR 
1027_125140_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey s brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully 
1027_125140_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But the Reverend Frank inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things say out of nine and thirty calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them held his peace 
1027_125140_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked and did not profess that they made him savagely wise 
1027_125140_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He only learned that the more he himself knew in his little limited human way the better he could distantly imagine what Omniscience might know 
1027_125140_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Wherefore if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled some of his brethren and profitably touched innumerable hearts in a worse case than Johnny s he would have done so out of the pity and humility of his soul 
none	none	Reading them over Johnny he thought of his own six children but not of his poverty and read them with dimmed eyes And very seriously did he and his bright little wife who had been listening look down into the small grave and walk home arm in arm 
1027_125140_000011_000000	train-clean-360	There was grief in the aristocratic house and there was joy in the Bower 
none	none	mister Wegg argued if an orphan were wanted was he not an orphan himself and could a better be desired 
1027_125140_000011_000002	train-clean-360	And why go beating about Brentford bushes seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane and Uncle Parker 
1027_125140_000012_000000	train-clean-360	mister Wegg chuckled consequently when he heard the tidings 
1027_125140_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Nay it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless that in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg in the stage ballet manner and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to him 
1027_125140_000013_000000	train-clean-360	John Rokesmith s manner towards missus Boffin at this time was more the manner of a young man towards a mother than that of a Secretary towards his employer s wife 
none	none	It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have no oddity for him he had sometimes borne a quietly amused face in her company but still it had seemed as if the pleasure her genial temper and radiant nature yielded him could have been quite as naturally expressed in a tear as in a smile 
1027_125140_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear he had shown in every act and word and now that the kind fancy was disappointed he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough 
1027_125140_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 But I do thank you mister Rokesmith said missus Boffin and I thank you most kindly 
1027_125140_000014_000001	train-clean-360	You love children 
1027_125140_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope everybody does 
none	none	They ought said missus Boffin but we don t all of us do what we ought do us 
1027_125140_000017_000000	train-clean-360	John Rokesmith replied Some among us supply the short comings of the rest 
1027_125140_000017_000001	train-clean-360	You have loved children well mister Boffin has told me 
none	none	Not a bit better than he has but that s his way he puts all the good upon me 
1027_125140_000018_000001	train-clean-360	You speak rather sadly mister Rokesmith 
none	none	Do I
1027_125140_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 It sounds to me so 
1027_125140_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Were you one of many children He shook his head 
1027_125140_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 An only child 
1027_125140_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 No there was another 
none	none	Dead long ago Father or mother alive Dead
1027_125140_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 And the rest of your relations 
none	none	Dead if I ever had any living I never heard of any At this point of the dialogue Bella came in with a light step 
1027_125140_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She paused at the door a moment hesitating whether to remain or retire perplexed by finding that she was not observed 
1027_125140_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Now don t mind an old lady s talk said missus Boffin but tell me 
none	none	Are you quite sure mister Rokesmith that you have never had a disappointment in love Quite sure 
1027_125140_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Why do you ask me 
1027_125140_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Why for this reason 
1027_125140_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes you have a kind of kept down manner with you which is not like your age 
1027_125140_000030_000002	train-clean-360	You can t be thirty 
1027_125140_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not yet thirty 
1027_125140_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Deeming it high time to make her presence known Bella coughed here to attract attention begged pardon and said she would go fearing that she interrupted some matter of business 
1027_125140_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 No don t go rejoined missus Boffin because we are coming to business instead of having begun it and you belong to it as much now my dear Bella as I do 
none	none	But I want my Noddy to consult with us Would somebody be so good as find my Noddy for me 
1027_125140_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Rokesmith departed on that errand and presently returned accompanied by mister Boffin at his jog trot 
1027_125140_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Bella felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject matter of this same consultation until missus Boffin announced it 
none	none	Now you come and sit by me my dear said that worthy soul taking her comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room and drawing her arm through Bella s and Noddy you sit here and mister Rokesmith you sit there 
1027_125140_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Now you see what I want to talk about is this 
1027_125140_000035_000002	train-clean-360	mister and missus Milvey have sent me the kindest note possible which mister Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud for I ain t good at handwritings offering to find me another little child to name and educate and bring up 
none	none	Well 
1027_125140_000035_000004	train-clean-360	This has set me thinking 
none	none	And she is a steam ingein at it murmured mister Boffin in an admiring parenthesis when she once begins It mayn t be so easy to start her but once started she s a ingein
1027_125140_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 This has set me thinking I say repeated missus Boffin cordially beaming under the influence of her husband s compliment and I have thought two things 
none	none	First of all that I have grown timid of reviving John Harmon s name 
1027_125140_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It s an unfortunate name and I fancy I should reproach myself if I gave it to another dear child and it proved again unlucky 
1027_125140_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Now whether said mister Boffin gravely propounding a case for his Secretary s opinion whether one might call that a superstition 
none	none	It is a matter of feeling with missus Boffin said Rokesmith gently The name has always been unfortunate 
1027_125140_000039_000001	train-clean-360	It has now this new unfortunate association connected with it 
1027_125140_000039_000002	train-clean-360	The name has died out 
1027_125140_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Why revive it Might I ask Miss Wilfer what she thinks 
1027_125140_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 It has not been a fortunate name for me said Bella colouring or at least it was not until it led to my being here but that is not the point in my thoughts 
1027_125140_000040_000001	train-clean-360	As we had given the name to the poor child and as the poor child took so lovingly to me I think I should feel jealous of calling another child by it 
none	none	I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me and I had no right to use it so
1027_125140_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 And that s your opinion remarked mister Boffin observant of the Secretary s face and again addressing him 
1027_125140_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I say again it is a matter of feeling returned the Secretary 
none	none	I think Miss Wilfer s feeling very womanly and pretty
1027_125140_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Now give us your opinion Noddy said missus Boffin 
1027_125140_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 My opinion old lady returned the Golden Dustman is your opinion 
1027_125140_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Then said missus Boffin we agree not to revive John Harmon s name but to let it rest in the grave 
1027_125140_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It is as mister Rokesmith says a matter of feeling but Lor how many matters ARE matters of feeling 
1027_125140_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Well and so I come to the second thing I have thought of 
none	none	You must know Bella my dear and mister Rokesmith that when I first named to my husband my thoughts of adopting a little orphan boy in remembrance of John Harmon I further named to my husband that it was comforting to think that how the poor boy would be benefited by John s own money and protected from John s own forlornness
1027_125140_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Hear hear cried mister Boffin 
none	none	So she did Ancoar No not Ancoar Noddy my dear returned missus Boffin because I am going to say something else 
1027_125140_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I meant that I am sure as much as I still mean it 
1027_125140_000047_000002	train-clean-360	But this little death has made me ask myself the question seriously whether I wasn t too bent upon pleasing myself Else why did I seek out so much for a pretty child and a child quite to my liking 
1027_125140_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Wanting to do good why not do it for its own sake and put my tastes and likings by 
1027_125140_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps said Bella and perhaps she said it with some little sensitiveness arising out of those old curious relations of hers towards the murdered man perhaps in reviving the name you would not have liked to give it to a less interesting child than the original 
1027_125140_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He interested you very much 
1027_125140_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Well my dear returned missus Boffin giving her a squeeze it s kind of you to find that reason out and I hope it may have been so and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so but I am afraid not to the whole extent 
1027_125140_000049_000001	train-clean-360	However that don t come in question now because we have done with the name 
1027_125140_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Laid it up as a remembrance suggested Bella musingly 
1027_125140_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Much better said my dear laid it up as a remembrance 
none	none	Well then I have been thinking if I take any orphan to provide for let it not be a pet and a plaything for me but a creature to be helped for its own sake
1027_125140_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Not pretty then said Bella 
1027_125140_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 No returned missus Boffin 
1027_125140_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No returned missus Boffin stoutly 
1027_125140_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor prepossessing then said Bella 
none	none	No returned missus Boffin Not necessarily so 
1027_125140_000055_000002	train-clean-360	That s as it may happen A well disposed boy comes in my way who may be even a little wanting in such advantages for getting on in life but is honest and industrious and requires a helping hand and deserves it 
1027_125140_000055_000003	train-clean-360	If I am very much in earnest and quite determined to be unselfish let me take care of HIM 
1027_125140_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion appeared and crossing to Rokesmith apologetically announced the objectionable Sloppy 
1027_125140_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The four members of Council looked at one another and paused 
1027_125140_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 Shall he be brought here ma am asked Rokesmith 
1027_125140_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said missus Boffin 
1027_125140_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Whereupon the footman disappeared reappeared presenting Sloppy and retired much disgusted 
1027_125140_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The consideration of missus Boffin had clothed mister Sloppy in a suit of black on which the tailor had received personal directions from Rokesmith to expend the utmost cunning of his art with a view to the concealment of the cohering and sustaining buttons 
1027_125140_000059_000001	train-clean-360	But so much more powerful were the frailties of Sloppy s form than the strongest resources of tailoring science that he now stood before the Council a perfect Argus in the way of buttons shining and winking and gleaming and twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal at the dazzled spectators 
1027_125140_000059_000002	train-clean-360	The artistic taste of some unknown hatter had furnished him with a hatband of wholesale capacity which was fluted behind from the crown of his hat to the brim and terminated in a black bunch from which the imagination shrunk discomfited and the reason revolted 
none	none	Some special powers with which his legs were endowed had already hitched up his glossy trousers at the ankles and bagged them at the knees while similar gifts in his arms had raised his coat sleeves from his wrists and accumulated them at his elbows Thus set forth with the additional embellishments of a very little tail to his coat and a yawning gulf at his waistband Sloppy stood confessed And how is Betty my good fellow missus Boffin asked him Thankee mum said Sloppy she do pretty nicely and sending her dooty and many thanks for the tea and all faviours and wishing to know the family s healths
1027_125140_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you just come Sloppy 
none	none	Yes mum Then you have not had your dinner yet No mum 
1027_125140_000065_000001	train-clean-360	But I mean to it 
none	none	For I ain t forgotten your handsome orders that I was never to go away without having had a good un off of meat and beer and pudding no there was four of em for I reckoned em up when I had em meat one beer two vegetables three and which was four Why pudding HE was four Here Sloppy threw his head back opened his mouth wide and laughed rapturously
1027_125140_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 How are the two poor little Minders asked missus Boffin 
1027_125140_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Striking right out mum and coming round beautiful 
none	none	missus Boffin looked on the other three members of Council and then said beckoning with her finger Sloppy Yes mum
1027_125140_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Come forward Sloppy 
1027_125140_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Should you like to dine here every day 
none	none	Off of all four on em mum O mum Sloppy s feelings obliged him to squeeze his hat and contract one leg at the knee Yes And should you like to be always taken care of here if you were industrious and deserving
1027_125140_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mum But there s missus Higden said Sloppy checking himself in his raptures drawing back and shaking his head with very serious meaning There s missus Higden 
1027_125140_000074_000001	train-clean-360	missus Higden goes before all 
none	none	None can ever be better friends to me than missus Higden s been 
1027_125140_000074_000003	train-clean-360	And she must be turned for must missus Higden 
1027_125140_000074_000004	train-clean-360	Where would missus Higden be if she warn t turned for At the mere thought of missus Higden in this inconceivable affliction mister Sloppy s countenance became pale and manifested the most distressful emotions 
none	none	You are as right as right can be Sloppy said missus Boffin and far be it from me to tell you otherwise 
1027_125140_000075_000001	train-clean-360	It shall be seen to 
1027_125140_000075_000002	train-clean-360	If Betty Higden can be turned for all the same you shall come here and be taken care of for life and be made able to keep her in other ways than the turning 
1027_125140_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Even as to that mum answered the ecstatic Sloppy the turning might be done in the night don t you see 
1027_125140_000076_000001	train-clean-360	I could be here in the day and turn in the night 
1027_125140_000076_000002	train-clean-360	I don t want no sleep I don t 
1027_125140_000076_000003	train-clean-360	Or even if I any ways should want a wink or two added Sloppy after a moment s apologetic reflection I could take em turning 
1027_125140_000076_000004	train-clean-360	I ve took em turning many a time and enjoyed em wonderful 
1027_125140_000077_000000	train-clean-360	On the grateful impulse of the moment mister Sloppy kissed missus Boffin s hand and then detaching himself from that good creature that he might have room enough for his feelings threw back his head opened his mouth wide and uttered a dismal howl 
none	none	It was creditable to his tenderness of heart but suggested that he might on occasion give some offence to the neighbours the rather as the footman looked in and begged pardon finding he was not wanted but excused himself on the ground that he thought it was Cats Chapter eleven SOME AFFAIRS OF THE HEART Little Miss Peecher from her little official dwelling house with its little windows like the eyes in needles and its little doors like the covers of school books was very observant indeed of the object of her quiet affections Love though said to be afflicted with blindness is a vigilant watchman and Miss Peecher kept him on double duty over mister Bradley Headstone It was not that she was naturally given to playing the spy it was not that she was at all secret plotting or mean it was simply that she loved the irresponsive Bradley with all the primitive and homely stock of love that had never been examined or certificated out of her If her faithful slate had had the latent qualities of sympathetic paper and its pencil those of invisible ink many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come bursting through the dry sums in school time under the warming influence of Miss Peecher s bosom For oftentimes when school was not and her calm leisure and calm little house were her own Miss Peecher would commit to the confidential slate an imaginary description of how upon a balmy evening at dusk two figures might have been observed in the market garden ground round the corner of whom one being a manly form bent over the other being a womanly form of short stature and some compactness and breathed in a low voice the words Emma Peecher wilt thou be my own after which the womanly form s head reposed upon the manly form s shoulder and the nightingales tuned up Though all unseen and unsuspected by the pupils Bradley Headstone even pervaded the school exercises Was Geography in question He would come triumphantly flying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava and would boil unharmed in the hot springs of Iceland and would float majestically down the Ganges and the Nile Did History chronicle a king of men Behold him in pepper and salt pantaloons with his watch guard round his neck Were copies to be written In capital B s and H s most of the girls under Miss Peecher s tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet And Mental Arithmetic administered by Miss Peecher often devoted itself to providing Bradley Headstone with a wardrobe of fabulous extent fourscore and four neck ties at two and ninepence halfpenny two gross of silver watches at four pounds fifteen and sixpence seventy four black hats at eighteen shillings and many similar superfluities The vigilant watchman using his daily opportunities of turning his eyes in Bradley s direction soon apprized Miss Peecher that Bradley was more preoccupied than had been his wont and more given to strolling about with a downcast and reserved face turning something difficult in his mind that was not in the scholastic syllabus Putting this and that together combining under the head this present appearances and the intimacy with Charley Hexam and ranging under the head that the visit to his sister the watchman reported to Miss Peecher his strong suspicions that the sister was at the bottom of it I wonder said Miss Peecher as she sat making up her weekly report on a half holiday afternoon what they call Hexam s sister Mary Anne at her needlework attendant and attentive held her arm up Well Mary Anne She is named Lizzie ma am She can hardly be named Lizzie I think Mary Anne returned Miss Peecher in a tunefully instructive voice Is Lizzie a Christian name Mary Anne Mary Anne laid down her work rose hooked herself behind as being under catechization and replied No it is a corruption Miss Peecher Who gave her that name Miss Peecher was going on from the mere force of habit when she checked herself on Mary Anne s evincing theological impatience to strike in with her godfathers and her godmothers and said I mean of what name is it a corruption Elizabeth or Eliza Miss Peecher Right Mary Anne Whether there were any Lizzies in the early Christian Church must be considered very doubtful very doubtful Miss Peecher was exceedingly sage here Speaking correctly we say then that Hexam s sister is called Lizzie not that she is named so Do we not Mary Anne We do Miss Peecher And where pursued Miss Peecher complacent in her little transparent fiction of conducting the examination in a semiofficial manner for Mary Anne s benefit not her own where does this young woman who is called but not named Lizzie live Think now before answering In Church Street Smith Square by Mill Bank ma am In Church Street Smith Square by Mill Bank repeated Miss Peecher as if possessed beforehand of the book in which it was written Exactly so And what occupation does this young woman pursue Mary Anne Take time She has a place of trust at an outfitter s in the City ma am Oh said Miss Peecher pondering on it but smoothly added in a confirmatory tone At an outfitter s in the City Ye es And Charley Mary Anne was proceeding when Miss Peecher stared I mean Hexam Miss Peecher I should think you did Mary Anne I am glad to hear you do And Hexam Says Mary Anne went on that he is not pleased with his sister and that his sister won t be guided by his advice and persists in being guided by somebody else s and that mister Headstone coming across the garden exclaimed Miss Peecher with a flushed glance at the looking glass You have answered very well Mary Anne You are forming an excellent habit of arranging your thoughts clearly That will do The discreet Mary Anne resumed her seat and her silence and stitched and stitched and was stitching when the schoolmaster s shadow came in before him announcing that he might be instantly expected Good evening Miss Peecher he said pursuing the shadow and taking its place Good evening mister Headstone Mary Anne a chair Thank you said Bradley seating himself in his constrained manner This is but a flying visit I have looked in on my way to ask a kindness of you as a neighbour Did you say on your way mister Headstone asked Miss Peecher On my way to where I am going Church Street Smith Square by Mill Bank repeated Miss Peecher in her own thoughts Charley Hexam has gone to get a book or two he wants and will probably be back before me As we leave my house empty I took the liberty of telling him I would leave the key here Would you kindly allow me to do so Certainly mister Headstone Going for an evening walk sir Partly for a walk and partly for on business Business in Church Street Smith Square by Mill Bank repeated Miss Peecher to herself Having said which pursued Bradley laying his door key on the table I must be already going There is nothing I can do for you Miss Peecher Thank you mister Headstone In which direction In the direction of Westminster Mill Bank Miss Peecher repeated in her own thoughts once again No thank you mister Headstone I ll not trouble you You couldn t trouble me said the schoolmaster Ah returned Miss Peecher though not aloud but you can trouble ME And for all her quiet manner and her quiet smile she was full of trouble as he went his way She was right touching his destination He held as straight a course for the house of the dolls dressmaker as the wisdom of his ancestors exemplified in the construction of the intervening streets would let him and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea It had been an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her It seemed to him as if all that he could suppress in himself he had suppressed as if all that he could restrain in himself he had restrained and the time had come in a rush in a moment when the power of self command had departed from him Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man s that passion leaps into a blaze and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind when other passions but for its mastery could be held in chains As a multitude of weak imitative natures are always lying by ready to go mad upon the next wrong idea that may be broached in these times generally some form of tribute to Somebody for something that never was done or if ever done that was done by Somebody Else so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years ready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame The schoolmaster went his way brooding and brooding and a sense of being vanquished in a struggle might have been pieced out of his worried face Truly in his breast there lingered a resentful shame to find himself defeated by this passion for Charley Hexam s sister though in the very self same moments he was concentrating himself upon the object of bringing the passion to a successful issue He appeared before the dolls dressmaker sitting alone at her work Oho thought that sharp young personage it s you is it I know your tricks and your manners my friend Hexam s sister said Bradley Headstone is not come home yet You are quite a conjuror returned Miss Wren I will wait if you please for I want to speak to her Do you returned Miss Wren Sit down I hope it s mutual Bradley glanced distrustfully at the shrewd face again bending over the work and said trying to conquer doubt and hesitation I hope you don t imply that my visit will be unacceptable to Hexam s sister There Don t call her that I can t bear you to call her that returned Miss Wren snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps for I don t like Hexam Indeed No Miss Wren wrinkled her nose to express dislike Selfish Thinks only of himself The way with all of you The way with all of us Then you don t like ME So so replied Miss Wren with a shrug and a laugh Don t know much about you But I was not aware it was the way with all of us said Bradley returning to the accusation a little injured Won t you say some of us Meaning returned the little creature every one of you but you Hah Now look this lady in the face This is missus Truth The Honourable Full dressed Bradley glanced at the doll she held up for his observation which had been lying on its face on her bench while with a needle and thread she fastened the dress on at the back and looked from it to her I stand the Honourable missus T on my bench in this corner against the wall where her blue eyes can shine upon you pursued Miss Wren doing so and making two little dabs at him in the air with her needle as if she pricked him with it in his own eyes and I defy you to tell me with missus T for a witness what you have come here for To see Hexam s sister You don t say so retorted Miss Wren hitching her chin But on whose account Her own O missus T exclaimed Miss Wren You hear him To reason with her pursued Bradley half humouring what was present and half angry with what was not present for her own sake Oh missus T exclaimed the dressmaker For her own sake repeated Bradley warming and for her brother s and as a perfectly disinterested person Really missus T remarked the dressmaker since it comes to this we must positively turn you with your face to the wall She had hardly done so when Lizzie Hexam arrived and showed some surprise on seeing Bradley Headstone there and Jenny shaking her little fist at him close before her eyes and the Honourable missus T with her face to the wall Here s a perfectly disinterested person Lizzie dear said the knowing Miss Wren come to talk with you for your own sake and your brother s Think of that I am sure there ought to be no third party present at anything so very kind and so very serious and so if you ll remove the third party upstairs my dear the third party will retire Lizzie took the hand which the dolls dressmaker held out to her for the purpose of being supported away but only looked at her with an inquiring smile and made no other movement The third party hobbles awfully you know when she s left to herself said Miss Wren her back being so bad and her legs so queer so she can t retire gracefully unless you help her Lizzie She can do no better than stay where she is returned Lizzie releasing the hand and laying her own lightly on Miss Jenny s curls And then to Bradley From Charley sir In an irresolute way and stealing a clumsy look at her Bradley rose to place a chair for her and then returned to his own Strictly speaking said he I come from Charley because I left him only a little while ago but I am not commissioned by Charley I come of my own spontaneous act With her elbows on her bench and her chin upon her hands Miss Jenny Wren sat looking at him with a watchful sidelong look Lizzie in her different way sat looking at him too The fact is began Bradley with a mouth so dry that he had some difficulty in articulating his words the consciousness of which rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided the truth is that Charley having no secrets from me to the best of my belief has confided the whole of this matter to me He came to a stop and Lizzie asked what matter sir I thought returned the schoolmaster stealing another look at her and seeming to try in vain to sustain it for the look dropped as it lighted on her eyes that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent to enter upon a definition of it My allusion was to this matter of your having put aside your brother s plans for you and given the preference to those of mister I believe the name is mister Eugene Wrayburn He made this point of not being certain of the name with another uneasy look at her which dropped like the last Nothing being said on the other side he had to begin again and began with new embarrassment Your brother s plans were communicated to me when he first had them in his thoughts In point of fact he spoke to me about them when I was last here when we were walking back together and when I when the impression was fresh upon me of having seen his sister There might have been no meaning in it but the little dressmaker here removed one of her supporting hands from her chin and musingly turned the Honourable missus T with her face to the company That done she fell into her former attitude I approved of his idea said Bradley with his uneasy look wandering to the doll and unconsciously resting there longer than it had rested on Lizzie both because your brother ought naturally to be the originator of any such scheme and because I hoped to be able to promote it I should have had inexpressible pleasure I should have taken inexpressible interest in promoting it Therefore I must acknowledge that when your brother was disappointed I too was disappointed I wish to avoid reservation or concealment and I fully acknowledge that He appeared to have encouraged himself by having got so far At all events he went on with much greater firmness and force of emphasis though with a curious disposition to set his teeth and with a curious tight screwing movement of his right hand in the clenching palm of his left like the action of one who was being physically hurt and was unwilling to cry out I am a man of strong feelings and I have strongly felt this disappointment I do strongly feel it I don t show what I feel some of us are obliged habitually to keep it down To keep it down But to return to your brother He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated in my presence he remonstrated with mister Eugene Wrayburn if that be the name He did so quite ineffectually As any one not blinded to the real character of mister mister Eugene Wrayburn would readily suppose He looked at Lizzie again and held the look And his face turned from burning red to white and from white back to burning red and so for the time to lasting deadly white Finally I resolved to come here alone and appeal to you I resolved to come here alone and entreat you to retract the course you have chosen and instead of confiding in a mere stranger a person of most insolent behaviour to your brother and others to prefer your brother and your brother s friend Lizzie Hexam had changed colour when those changes came over him and her face now expressed some anger more dislike and even a touch of fear But she answered him very steadily I cannot doubt mister Headstone that your visit is well meant You have been so good a friend to Charley that I have no right to doubt it I have nothing to tell Charley but that I accepted the help to which he so much objects before he made any plans for me or certainly before I knew of any It was considerately and delicately offered and there were reasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley as to me I have no more to say to Charley on this subject His lips trembled and stood apart as he followed this repudiation of himself and limitation of her words to her brother I should have told Charley if he had come to me she resumed as though it were an after thought that Jenny and I find our teacher very able and very patient and that she takes great pains with us So much so that we have said to her we hope in a very little while to be able to go on by ourselves Charley knows about teachers and I should also have told him for his satisfaction that ours comes from an institution where teachers are regularly brought up I should like to ask you said Bradley Headstone grinding his words slowly out as though they came from a rusty mill I should like to ask you if I may without offence whether you would have objected no rather I should like to say if I may without offence that I wish I had had the opportunity of coming here with your brother and devoting my poor abilities and experience to your service Thank you mister Headstone But I fear he pursued after a pause furtively wrenching at the seat of his chair with one hand as if he would have wrenched the chair to pieces and gloomily observing her while her eyes were cast down that my humble services would not have found much favour with you She made no reply and the poor stricken wretch sat contending with himself in a heat of passion and torment After a while he took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead and hands There is only one thing more I had to say but it is the most important There is a reason against this matter there is a personal relation concerned in this matter not yet explained to you It might I don t say it would it might induce you to think differently To proceed under the present circumstances is out of the question Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on the subject With Charley mister Headstone With well he answered breaking off yes Say with him too Will you please come to the understanding that there must be another interview under more favourable circumstances before the whole case can be submitted I don t said Lizzie shaking her head understand your meaning mister Headstone Limit my meaning for the present he interrupted to the whole case being submitted to you in another interview What case mister Headstone What is wanting to it You you shall be informed in the other interview Then he said as if in a burst of irrepressible despair I I leave it all incomplete There is a spell upon me I think And then added almost as if he asked for pity Good night He held out his hand As she with manifest hesitation not to say reluctance touched it a strange tremble passed over him and his face so deadly white was moved as by a stroke of pain Then he was gone The dolls dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged eyeing the door by which he had departed until Lizzie pushed her bench aside and sat down near her Then eyeing Lizzie as she had previously eyed Bradley and the door Miss Wren chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which her jaws sometimes indulged leaned back in her chair with folded arms and thus expressed herself Humph If he I mean of course my dear the party who is coming to court me when the time comes should be THAT sort of man he may spare himself the trouble HE wouldn t do to be trotted about and made useful He d take fire and blow up while he was about it And so you would be rid of him said Lizzie humouring her Not so easily returned Miss Wren He wouldn t blow up alone He d carry me up with him I know his tricks and his manners Would he want to hurt you do you mean asked Lizzie Mightn t exactly want to do it my dear returned Miss Wren but a lot of gunpowder among lighted lucifer matches in the next room might almost as well be here He is a very strange man said Lizzie thoughtfully I wish he was so very strange a man as to be a total stranger answered the sharp little thing It being Lizzie s regular occupation when they were alone of an evening to brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls dressmaker she unfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at her work and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that were much in need of such adorning rain Not now Lizzie dear said Jenny let us have a talk by the fire With those words she in her turn loosened her friend s dark hair and it dropped of its own weight over her bosom in two rich masses Pretending to compare the colours and admire the contrast Jenny so managed a mere touch or two of her nimble hands as that she herself laying a cheek on one of the dark folds seemed blinded by her own clustering curls to all but the fire while the fine handsome face and brow of Lizzie were revealed without obstruction in the sombre light Let us have a talk said Jenny about mister Eugene Wrayburn Something sparkled down among the fair hair resting on the dark hair and if it were not a star which it couldn t be it was an eye and if it were an eye it was Jenny Wren s eye bright and watchful as the bird s whose name she had taken Why about mister Wrayburn Lizzie asked For no better reason than because I m in the humour I wonder whether he s rich No not rich Poor I think so for a gentleman Ah To be sure Yes he s a gentleman Not of our sort is he A shake of the head a thoughtful shake of the head and the answer softly spoken Oh no oh no The dolls dressmaker had an arm round her friend s waist Adjusting the arm she slyly took the opportunity of blowing at her own hair where it fell over her face then the eye down there under lighter shadows sparkled more brightly and appeared more watchful When He turns up he shan t be a gentleman I ll very soon send him packing if he is However he s not mister Wrayburn I haven t captivated HIM I wonder whether anybody has Lizzie It is very likely Is it very likely I wonder who Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by him and that he may love her dearly Perhaps I don t know What would you think of him Lizzie if you were a lady I a lady she repeated laughing Such a fancy Yes But say just as a fancy and for instance I a lady I a poor girl who used to row poor father on the river I who had rowed poor father out and home on the very night when I saw him for the first time I who was made so timid by his looking at me that I got up and went out He did look at you even that night though you were not a lady thought Miss Wren I a lady Lizzie went on in a low voice with her eyes upon the fire I with poor father s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame and he trying to clear it for me I a lady Only as a fancy and for instance urged Miss Wren Too much Jenny dear too much My fancy is not able to get that far As the low fire gleamed upon her it showed her smiling mournfully and abstractedly But I am in the humour and I must be humoured Lizzie because after all I am a poor little thing and have had a hard day with my bad child Look in the fire as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you lived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill Look in the what was its name when you told fortunes with your brother that I DON T like The hollow down by the flare Ah That s the name You can find a lady there I know More easily than I can make one of such material as myself Jenny The sparkling eye looked steadfastly up as the musing face looked thoughtfully down Well said the dolls dressmaker We have found our lady Lizzie nodded and asked Shall she be rich She had better be as he s poor She is very rich Shall she be handsome Even you can be that Lizzie so she ought to be She is very handsome What does she say about him asked Miss Jenny in a low voice watchful through an intervening silence of the face looking down at the fire She is glad glad to be rich that he may have the money She is glad glad to be beautiful that he may be proud of her Her poor heart Eh Her poor hear said Miss Wren Her heart is given him with all its love and truth She would joyfully die with him or better than that die for him She knows he has failings but she thinks they have grown up through his being like one cast away for the want of something to trust in and care for and think well of And she says that lady rich and beautiful that I can never come near Only put me in that empty place only try how little I mind myself only prove what a world of things I will do and bear for you and I hope that you might even come to be much better than you are through me who am so much worse and hardly worth the thinking of beside you As the face looking at the fire had become exalted and forgetful in the rapture of these words the little creature openly clearing away her fair hair with her disengaged hand had gazed at it with earnest attention and something like alarm Now that the speaker ceased the little creature laid down her head again and moaned O me O me O me In pain dear Jenny asked Lizzie as if awakened Yes but not the old pain Lay me down lay me down Don t go out of my sight to night Lock the door and keep close to me Then turning away her face she said in a whisper to herself My Lizzie my poor Lizzie O my blessed children come back in the long bright slanting rows and come for her not me She wants help more than I my blessed children She had stretched her hands up with that higher and better look and now she turned again and folded them round Lizzie s neck and rocked herself on Lizzie s breast Chapter twelve MORE BIRDS OF PREY Rogue Riderhood dwelt deep and dark in Limehouse Hole among the riggers and the mast oar and block makers and the boat builders and the sail lofts as in a kind of ship s hold stored full of waterside characters some no better than himself some very much better and none much worse The Hole albeit in a general way not over nice in its choice of company was rather shy in reference to the honour of cultivating the Rogue s acquaintance more frequently giving him the cold shoulder than the warm hand and seldom or never drinking with him unless at his own expense A part of the Hole indeed contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser But there may have been the drawback on this magnanimous morality that its exponents held a true witness before Justice to be the next unneighbourly and accursed character to a false one Had it not been for the daughter whom he often mentioned mister Riderhood might have found the Hole a mere grave as to any means it would yield him of getting a living But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little position and connection in Limehouse Hole Upon the smallest of small scales she was an unlicensed pawnbroker keeping what was popularly called a Leaving Shop by lending insignificant sums on insignificant articles of property deposited with her as security In her four and twentieth year of life Pleasant was already in her fifth year of this way of trade Her deceased mother had established the business and on that parent s demise she had appropriated a secret capital of fifteen shillings to establishing herself in it the existence of such capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential communication made to her by the departed before succumbing to dropsical conditions of snuff and gin incompatible equally with coherence and existence Why christened Pleasant the late missus Riderhood might possibly have been at some time able to explain and possibly not Her daughter had no information on that point Pleasant she found herself and she couldn t help it She had not been consulted on the question any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts to want a name Similarly she found herself possessed of what is colloquially termed a swivel eye derived from her father which she might perhaps have declined if her sentiments on the subject had been taken She was not otherwise positively ill looking though anxious meagre of a muddy complexion and looking as old again as she really was As some dogs have it in the blood or are trained to worry certain creatures to a certain point so not to make the comparison disrespectfully Pleasant Riderhood had it in the blood or had been trained to regard seamen within certain limits as her prey Show her a man in a blue jacket and figuratively speaking she pinned him instantly Yet all things considered she was not of an evil mind or an unkindly disposition For observe how many things were to be considered according to her own unfortunate experience Show Pleasant Riderhood a Wedding in the street and she only saw two people taking out a regular licence to quarrel and fight Show her a Christening and she saw a little heathen personage having a quite superfluous name bestowed upon it inasmuch as it would be commonly addressed by some abusive epithet which little personage was not in the least wanted by anybody and would be shoved and banged out of everybody s way until it should grow big enough to shove and bang Show her a Funeral and she saw an unremunerative ceremony in the nature of a black masquerade conferring a temporary gentility on the performers at an immense expense and representing the only formal party ever given by the deceased Show her a live father and she saw but a duplicate of her own father who from her infancy had been taken with fits and starts of discharging his duty to her which duty was always incorporated in the form of a fist or a leathern strap and being discharged hurt her All things considered therefore Pleasant Riderhood was not so very very bad There was even a touch of romance in her of such romance as could creep into Limehouse Hole and maybe sometimes of a summer evening when she stood with folded arms at her shop door looking from the reeking street to the sky where the sun was setting she may have had some vaporous visions of far off islands in the southern seas or elsewhere not being geographically particular where it would be good to roam with a congenial partner among groves of bread fruit waiting for ships to be wafted from the hollow ports of civilization For sailors to be got the better of were essential to Miss Pleasant s Eden Not on a summer evening did she come to her little shop door when a certain man standing over against the house on the opposite side of the street took notice of her That was on a cold shrewd windy evening after dark Pleasant Riderhood shared with most of the lady inhabitants of the Hole the peculiarity that her hair was a ragged knot constantly coming down behind and that she never could enter upon any undertaking without first twisting it into place At that particular moment being newly come to the threshold to take a look out of doors she was winding herself up with both hands after this fashion And so prevalent was the fashion that on the occasion of a fight or other disturbance in the Hole the ladies would be seen flocking from all quarters universally twisting their back hair as they came along and many of them in the hurry of the moment carrying their back combs in their mouths It was a wretched little shop with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand little better than a cellar or cave down three steps Yet in its ill lighted window among a flaring handkerchief or two an old peacoat or so a few valueless watches and compasses a jar of tobacco and two crossed pipes a bottle of walnut ketchup and some horrible sweets these creature discomforts serving as a blind to the main business of the Leaving Shop was displayed the inscription SEAMAN S BOARDING HOUSE Taking notice of Pleasant Riderhood at the door the man crossed so quickly that she was still winding herself up when he stood close before her Is your father at home said he I think he is returned Pleasant dropping her arms come in It was a tentative reply the man having a seafaring appearance Her father was not at home and Pleasant knew it Take a seat by the fire were her hospitable words when she had got him in men of your calling are always welcome here Thankee said the man His manner was the manner of a sailor and his hands were the hands of a sailor except that they were smooth Pleasant had an eye for sailors and she noticed the unused colour and texture of the hands sunburnt though they were as sharply as she noticed their unmistakable looseness and suppleness as he sat himself down with his left arm carelessly thrown across his left leg a little above the knee and the right arm as carelessly thrown over the elbow of the wooden chair with the hand curved half open and half shut as if it had just let go a rope Might you be looking for a Boarding House Pleasant inquired taking her observant stand on one side of the fire I don t rightly know my plans yet returned the man You ain t looking for a Leaving Shop No said the man No assented Pleasant you ve got too much of an outfit on you for that But if you should want either this is both Ay ay said the man glancing round the place I know I ve been here before Did you Leave anything when you were here before asked Pleasant with a view to principal and interest No The man shook his head I am pretty sure you never boarded here No The man again shook his head What DID you do here when you were here before asked Pleasant For I don t remember you It s not at all likely you should I only stood at the door one night on the lower step there while a shipmate of mine looked in to speak to your father I remember the place well Looking very curiously round it Might that have been long ago Ay a goodish bit ago When I came off my last voyage Then you have not been to sea lately No Been in the sick bay since then and been employed ashore Then to be sure that accounts for your hands The man with a keen look a quick smile and a change of manner caught her up You re a good observer Yes That accounts for my hands Pleasant was somewhat disquieted by his look and returned it suspiciously Not only was his change of manner though very sudden quite collected but his former manner which he resumed had a certain suppressed confidence and sense of power in it that were half threatening Will your father be long he inquired I don t know I can t say As you supposed he was at home it would seem that he has just gone out How s that I supposed he had come home Pleasant explained Oh You supposed he had come home Then he has been some time out How s that I don t want to deceive you Father s on the river in his boat At the old work asked the man I don t know what you mean said Pleasant shrinking a step back What on earth d ye want I don t want to hurt your father I don t want to say I might if I chose I want to speak to him Not much in that is there There shall be no secrets from you you shall be by And plainly Miss Riderhood there s nothing to be got out of me or made of me I am not good for the Leaving Shop I am not good for the Boarding House I am not good for anything in your way to the extent of sixpenn orth of halfpence Put the idea aside and we shall get on together But you re a seafaring man argued Pleasant as if that were a sufficient reason for his being good for something in her way Yes and no I have been and I may be again But I am not for you Won t you take my word for it The conversation had arrived at a crisis to justify Miss Pleasant s hair in tumbling down It tumbled down accordingly and she twisted it up looking from under her bent forehead at the man In taking stock of his familiarly worn rough weather nautical clothes piece by piece she took stock of a formidable knife in a sheath at his waist ready to his hand and of a whistle hanging round his neck and of a short jagged knotted club with a loaded head that peeped out of a pocket of his loose outer jacket or frock He sat quietly looking at her but with these appendages partially revealing themselves and with a quantity of bristling oakum coloured head and whisker he had a formidable appearance Won t you take my word for it he asked again Pleasant answered with a short dumb nod He rejoined with another short dumb nod Then he got up and stood with his arms folded in front of the fire looking down into it occasionally as she stood with her arms folded leaning against the side of the chimney piece To wile away the time till your father comes he said pray is there much robbing and murdering of seamen about the water side now No said Pleasant Any Complaints of that sort are sometimes made about Ratcliffe and Wapping and up that way But who knows how many are true To be sure And it don t seem necessary That s what I say observed Pleasant Where s the reason for it Bless the sailors it ain t as if they ever could keep what they have without it You re right Their money may be soon got out of them without violence said the man Of course it may said Pleasant and then they ship again and get more And the best thing for em too to ship again as soon as ever they can be brought to it They re never so well off as when they re afloat I ll tell you why I ask pursued the visitor looking up from the fire I was once beset that way myself and left for dead No said Pleasant Where did it happen It happened returned the man with a ruminative air as he drew his right hand across his chin and dipped the other in the pocket of his rough outer coat it happened somewhere about here as I reckon I don t think it can have been a mile from here Were you drunk asked Pleasant I was muddled but not with fair drinking I had not been drinking you understand A mouthful did it Pleasant with a grave look shook her head importing that she understood the process but decidedly disapproved Fair trade is one thing said she but that s another No one has a right to carry on with Jack in THAT way The sentiment does you credit returned the man with a grim smile and added in a mutter the more so as I believe it s not your father s Yes I had a bad time of it that time I lost everything and had a sharp struggle for my life weak as I was Did you get the parties punished asked Pleasant A tremendous punishment followed said the man more seriously but it was not of my bringing about Of whose then asked Pleasant The man pointed upward with his forefinger and slowly recovering that hand settled his chin in it again as he looked at the fire Bringing her inherited eye to bear upon him Pleasant Riderhood felt more and more uncomfortable his manner was so mysterious so stern so self possessed Anyways said the damsel I am glad punishment followed and I say so Fair trade with seafaring men gets a bad name through deeds of violence I am as much against deeds of violence being done to seafaring men as seafaring men can be themselves I am of the same opinion as my mother was when she was living Fair trade my mother used to say but no robbery and no blows In the way of trade Miss Pleasant would have taken and indeed did take when she could as much as thirty shillings a week for board that would be dear at five and likewise conducted the Leaving business upon correspondingly equitable principles yet she had that tenderness of conscience and those feelings of humanity that the moment her ideas of trade were overstepped she became the seaman s champion even against her father whom she seldom otherwise resisted But she was here interrupted by her father s voice exclaiming angrily Now Poll Parrot and by her father s hat being heavily flung from his hand and striking her face Accustomed to such occasional manifestations of his sense of parental duty Pleasant merely wiped her face on her hair which of course had tumbled down before she twisted it up This was another common procedure on the part of the ladies of the Hole when heated by verbal or fistic altercation Blest if I believe such a Poll Parrot as you was ever learned to speak growled mister Riderhood stooping to pick up his hat and making a feint at her with his head and right elbow for he took the delicate subject of robbing seamen in extraordinary dudgeon and was out of humour too What are you Poll Parroting at now Ain t you got nothing to do but fold your arms and stand a Poll Parroting all night Let her alone urged the man She was only speaking to me Let her alone too retorted mister Riderhood eyeing him all over Do you know she s my daughter Yes And don t you know that I won t have no Poll Parroting on the part of my daughter No nor yet that I won t take no Poll Parroting from no man And who may YOU be and what may YOU want How can I tell you until you are silent returned the other fiercely Well said mister Riderhood quailing a little I am willing to be silent for the purpose of hearing But don t Poll Parrot me Are you thirsty you the man asked in the same fierce short way after returning his look Why nat rally said mister Riderhood ain t I always thirsty Indignant at the absurdity of the question What will you drink demanded the man Sherry wine returned mister Riderhood in the same sharp tone if you re capable of it The man put his hand in his pocket took out half a sovereign and begged the favour of Miss Pleasant that she would fetch a bottle With the cork undrawn he added emphatically looking at her father I ll take my Alfred David muttered mister Riderhood slowly relaxing into a dark smile that you know a move Do I know YOU N n no I don t know you The man replied No you don t know me And so they stood looking at one another surlily enough until Pleasant came back There s small glasses on the shelf said Riderhood to his daughter Give me the one without a foot I gets my living by the sweat of my brow and it s good enough for ME This had a modest self denying appearance but it soon turned out that as by reason of the impossibility of standing the glass upright while there was anything in it it required to be emptied as soon as filled mister Riderhood managed to drink in the proportion of three to one With his Fortunatus s goblet ready in his hand mister Riderhood sat down on one side of the table before the fire and the strange man on the other Pleasant occupying a stool between the latter and the fireside The background composed of handkerchiefs coats shirts hats and other old articles On Leaving had a general dim resemblance to human listeners especially where a shiny black sou wester suit and hat hung looking very like a clumsy mariner with his back to the company who was so curious to overhear that he paused for the purpose with his coat half pulled on and his shoulders up to his ears in the uncompleted action The visitor first held the bottle against the light of the candle and next examined the top of the cork Satisfied that it had not been tampered with he slowly took from his breastpocket a rusty clasp knife and with a corkscrew in the handle opened the wine That done he looked at the cork unscrewed it from the corkscrew laid each separately on the table and with the end of the sailor s knot of his neckerchief dusted the inside of the neck of the bottle All this with great deliberation At first Riderhood had sat with his footless glass extended at arm s length for filling while the very deliberate stranger seemed absorbed in his preparations But gradually his arm reverted home to him and his glass was lowered and lowered until he rested it upside down upon the table By the same degrees his attention became concentrated on the knife And now as the man held out the bottle to fill all round Riderhood stood up leaned over the table to look closer at the knife and stared from it to him What s the matter asked the man Why I know that knife said Riderhood Yes I dare say you do He motioned to him to hold up his glass and filled it Riderhood emptied it to the last drop and began again That there knife Stop said the man composedly I was going to drink to your daughter Your health Miss Riderhood That knife was the knife of a seaman named George Radfoot It was That seaman was well beknown to me He was What s come to him Death has come to him Death came to him in an ugly shape He looked said the man very horrible after it Arter what said Riderhood with a frowning stare After he was killed Killed Who killed him Only answering with a shrug the man filled the footless glass and Riderhood emptied it looking amazedly from his daughter to his visitor You don t mean to tell a honest man he was recommencing with his empty glass in his hand when his eye became fascinated by the stranger s outer coat He leaned across the table to see it nearer touched the sleeve turned the cuff to look at the sleeve lining the man in his perfect composure offering not the least objection and exclaimed It s my belief as this here coat was George Radfoot s too You are right He wore it the last time you ever saw him and the last time you ever will see him in this world It s my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him exclaimed Riderhood but nevertheless allowing his glass to be filled again The man only answered with another shrug and showed no symptom of confusion Wish I may die if I know what to be up to with this chap said Riderhood after staring at him and tossing his last glassful down his throat Let s know what to make of you Say something plain I will returned the other leaning forward across the table and speaking in a low impressive voice What a liar you are The honest witness rose and made as though he would fling his glass in the man s face The man not wincing and merely shaking his forefinger half knowingly half menacingly the piece of honesty thought better of it and sat down again putting the glass down too And when you went to that lawyer yonder in the Temple with that invented story said the stranger in an exasperatingly comfortable sort of confidence you might have had your strong suspicions of a friend of your own you know I think you had you know Me my suspicions Of what friend Tell me again whose knife was this demanded the man It was possessed by and was the property of him as I have made mention on said Riderhood stupidly evading the actual mention of the name Tell me again whose coat was this That there article of clothing likeways belonged to and was wore by him as I have made mention on was again the dull Old Bailey evasion I suspect that you gave him the credit of the deed and of keeping cleverly out of the way But there was small cleverness in HIS keeping out of the way The cleverness would have been to have got back for one single instant to the light of the sun Things is come to a pretty pass growled mister Riderhood rising to his feet goaded to stand at bay when bullyers as is wearing dead men s clothes and bullyers as is armed with dead men s knives is to come into the houses of honest live men getting their livings by the sweats of their brows and is to make these here sort of charges with no rhyme and no reason neither the one nor yet the other Why should I have had my suspicions of him Because you knew him replied the man because you had been one with him and knew his real character under a fair outside because on the night which you had afterwards reason to believe to be the very night of the murder he came in here within an hour of his having left his ship in the docks and asked you in what lodgings he could find room Was there no stranger with him I ll take my world without end everlasting Alfred David that you warn t with him answered Riderhood You talk big you do but things look pretty black against yourself to my thinking You charge again me that George Radfoot got lost sight of and was no more thought of What s that for a sailor Why there s fifty such out of sight and out of mind ten times as long as him through entering in different names re shipping when the out ard voyage is made and what not a turning up to light every day about here and no matter made of it Ask my daughter You could go on Poll Parroting enough with her when I warn t come in Poll Parrot a little with her on this pint You and your suspicions of my suspicions of him What are my suspicions of you You tell me George Radfoot got killed I ask you who done it and how you know it You carry his knife and you wear his coat I ask you how you come by em Hand over that there bottle Here mister Riderhood appeared to labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property And you he added turning to his daughter as he filled the footless glass if it warn t wasting good sherry wine on you I d chuck this at you for Poll Parroting with this man It s along of Poll Parroting that such like as him gets their suspicions whereas I gets mine by argueyment and being nat rally a honest man and sweating away at the brow as a honest man ought Here he filled the footless goblet again and stood chewing one half of its contents and looking down into the other as he slowly rolled the wine about in the glass while Pleasant whose sympathetic hair had come down on her being apostrophised rearranged it much in the style of the tail of a horse when proceeding to market to be sold Well Have you finished asked the strange man No said Riderhood I ain t Far from it Now then I want to know how George Radfoot come by his death and how you come by his kit If you ever do know you won t know now And next I want to know proceeded Riderhood whether you mean to charge that what you may call it murder Harmon murder father suggested Pleasant No Poll Parroting he vociferated in return Keep your mouth shut I want to know you sir whether you charge that there crime on George Radfoot If you ever do know you won t know now Perhaps you done it yourself said Riderhood with a threatening action I alone know returned the man sternly shaking his head the mysteries of that crime I alone know that your trumped up story cannot possibly be true I alone know that it must be altogether false and that you must know it to be altogether false I come here to night to tell you so much of what I know and no more mister Riderhood with his crooked eye upon his visitor meditated for some moments and then refilled his glass and tipped the contents down his throat in three tips Shut the shop door he then said to his daughter putting the glass suddenly down And turn the key and stand by it If you know all this you sir getting as he spoke between the visitor and the door why han t you gone to Lawyer Lightwood That also is alone known to myself was the cool answer Don t you know that if you didn t do the deed what you say you could tell is worth from five to ten thousand pound asked Riderhood I know it very well and when I claim the money you shall share it The honest man paused and drew a little nearer to the visitor and a little further from the door I know it repeated the man quietly as well as I know that you and George Radfoot were one together in more than one dark business and as well as I know that you Roger Riderhood conspired against an innocent man for blood money and as well as I know that I can and that I swear I will give you up on both scores and be the proof against you in my own person if you defy me Father cried Pleasant from the door Don t defy him Give way to him Don t get into more trouble father Will you leave off a Poll Parroting I ask you cried mister Riderhood half beside himself between the two Then propitiatingly and crawlingly You sir You han t said what you want of me Is it fair is it worthy of yourself to talk of my defying you afore ever you say what you want of me I don t want much said the man This accusation of yours must not be left half made and half unmade What was done for the blood money must be thoroughly undone Well but Shipmate Don t call me Shipmate said the man Captain then urged mister Riderhood there You won t object to Captain It s a honourable title and you fully look it Captain Ain t the man dead Now I ask you fair Ain t Gaffer dead Well returned the other with impatience yes he is dead What then Can words hurt a dead man Captain I only ask you fair They can hurt the memory of a dead man and they can hurt his living children How many children had this man Meaning Gaffer Captain Of whom else are we speaking returned the other with a movement of his foot as if Rogue Riderhood were beginning to sneak before him in the body as well as the spirit and he spurned him off I have heard of a daughter and a son I ask for information I ask YOUR daughter I prefer to speak to her What children did Hexam leave Pleasant looking to her father for permission to reply that honest man exclaimed with great bitterness Why the devil don t you answer the Captain You can Poll Parrot enough when you ain t wanted to Poll Parrot you perwerse jade Thus encouraged Pleasant explained that there were only Lizzie the daughter in question and the youth Both very respectable she added It is dreadful that any stigma should attach to them said the visitor whom the consideration rendered so uneasy that he rose and paced to and fro muttering Dreadful Unforeseen How could it be foreseen Then he stopped and asked aloud Where do they live Pleasant further explained that only the daughter had resided with the father at the time of his accidental death and that she had immediately afterwards quitted the neighbourhood I know that said the man for I have been to the place they dwelt in at the time of the inquest Could you quietly find out for me where she lives now Pleasant had no doubt she could do that Within what time did she think Within a day The visitor said that was well and he would return for the information relying on its being obtained To this dialogue Riderhood had attended in silence and he now obsequiously bespake the Captain Captain Mentioning them unfort net words of mine respecting Gaffer it is contrairily to be bore in mind that Gaffer always were a precious rascal and that his line were a thieving line Likeways when I went to them two Governors Lawyer Lightwood and the t other Governor with my information I may have been a little over eager for the cause of justice or to put it another way a little over stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up when a pot of money is going about to get his hand into that pot of money for his family s sake Besides which I think the wine of them two Governors was I will not say a hocussed wine but fur from a wine as was elthy for the mind And there s another thing to be remembered Captain Did I stick to them words when Gaffer was no more and did I say bold to them two Governors Governors both wot I informed I still inform wot was took down I hold to No I says frank and open no shuffling mind you Captain I may have been mistook I ve been a thinking of it it mayn t have been took down correct on this and that and I won t swear to thick and thin I d rayther forfeit your good opinions than do it And so far as I know concluded mister Riderhood by way of proof and evidence to character I HAVE actiwally forfeited the good opinions of several persons even your own Captain if I understand your words but I d sooner do it than be forswore There if that s conspiracy call me conspirator You shall sign said the visitor taking very little heed of this oration a statement that it was all utterly false and the poor girl shall have it I will bring it with me for your signature when I come again When might you be expected Captain inquired Riderhood again dubiously getting between him and door Quite soon enough for you I shall not disappoint you don t be afraid Might you be inclined to leave any name Captain No not at all I have no such intention Shall is summ at of a hard word Captain urged Riderhood still feebly dodging between him and the door as he advanced When you say a man shall sign this and that and t other Captain you order him about in a grand sort of a way Don t it seem so to yourself The man stood still and angrily fixed him with his eyes Father father entreated Pleasant from the door with her disengaged hand nervously trembling at her lips don t Don t get into trouble any more Hear me out Captain hear me out All I was wishing to mention Captain afore you took your departer said the sneaking mister Riderhood falling out of his path was your handsome words relating to the reward When I claim it said the man in a tone which seemed to leave some such words as you dog very distinctly understood you shall share it Looking stedfastly at Riderhood he once more said in a low voice this time with a grim sort of admiration of him as a perfect piece of evil What a liar you are and nodding his head twice or thrice over the compliment passed out of the shop But to Pleasant he said good night kindly The honest man who gained his living by the sweat of his brow remained in a state akin to stupefaction until the footless glass and the unfinished bottle conveyed themselves into his mind From his mind he conveyed them into his hands and so conveyed the last of the wine into his stomach When that was done he awoke to a clear perception that Poll Parroting was solely chargeable with what had passed Therefore not to be remiss in his duty as a father he threw a pair of sea boots at Pleasant which she ducked to avoid and then cried poor thing using her hair for a pocket handkerchief Chapter thirteen A SOLO AND A DUETT The wind was blowing so hard when the visitor came out at the shop door into the darkness and dirt of Limehouse Hole that it almost blew him in again Doors were slamming violently lamps were flickering or blown out signs were rocking in their frames the water of the kennels wind dispersed flew about in drops like rain Indifferent to the weather and even preferring it to better weather for its clearance of the streets the man looked about him with a scrutinizing glance Thus much I know he murmured I have never been here since that night and never was here before that night but thus much I recognize I wonder which way did we take when we came out of that shop We turned to the right as I have turned but I can recall no more Did we go by this alley Or down that little lane He tried both but both confused him equally and he came straying back to the same spot I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying and I remember a low public house and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet But here are all these things in the lane and here are all these things in the alley And I have nothing else in my mind but a wall a dark doorway a flight of stairs and a room He tried a new direction but made nothing of it walls dark doorways flights of stairs and rooms were too abundant And like most people so puzzled he again and again described a circle and found himself at the point from which he had begun This is like what I have read in narratives of escape from prison said he where the little track of the fugitives in the night always seems to take the shape of the great round world on which they wander as if it were a secret law Here he ceased to be the oakum headed oakum whiskered man on whom Miss Pleasant Riderhood had looked and allowing for his being still wrapped in a nautical overcoat became as like that same lost wanted mister Julius Handford as never man was like another in this world In the breast of the coat he stowed the bristling hair and whisker in a moment as the favouring wind went with him down a solitary place that it had swept clear of passengers Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also mister Boffin s Secretary For John Rokesmith too was as like that same lost wanted mister Julius Handford as never man was like another in this world I have no clue to the scene of my death said he Not that it matters now But having risked discovery by venturing here at all I should have been glad to track some part of the way With which singular words he abandoned his search came up out of Limehouse Hole and took the way past Limehouse Church At the great iron gate of the churchyard he stopped and looked in He looked up at the high tower spectrally resisting the wind and he looked round at the white tombstones like enough to the dead in their winding sheets and he counted the nine tolls of the clock bell It is a sensation not experienced by many mortals said he to be looking into a churchyard on a wild windy night and to feel that I no more hold a place among the living than these dead do and even to know that I lie buried somewhere else as they lie buried here Nothing uses me to it A spirit that was once a man could hardly feel stranger or lonelier going unrecognized among mankind than I feel But this is the fanciful side of the situation It has a real side so difficult that though I think of it every day I never thoroughly think it out Now let me determine to think it out as I walk home I know I evade it as many men perhaps most men do evade thinking their way through their greatest perplexity I will try to pin myself to mine Don t evade it John Harmon don t evade it think it out When I came to England attracted to the country with which I had none but most miserable associations by the accounts of my fine inheritance that found me abroad I came back shrinking from my father s money shrinking from my father s memory mistrustful of being forced on a mercenary wife mistrustful of my father s intention in thrusting that marriage on me mistrustful that I was already growing avaricious mistrustful that I was slackening in gratitude to the two dear noble honest friends who had made the only sunlight in my childish life or that of my heartbroken sister I came back timid divided in my mind afraid of myself and everybody here knowing of nothing but wretchedness that my father s wealth had ever brought about Now stop and so far think it out John Harmon Is that so That is exactly so On board serving as third mate was George Radfoot I knew nothing of him His name first became known to me about a week before we sailed through my being accosted by one of the ship agent s clerks as mister Radfoot It was one day when I had gone aboard to look to my preparations and the clerk coming behind me as I stood on deck tapped me on the shoulder and said mister Rad foot look here referring to some papers that he had in his hand And my name first became known to Radfoot through another clerk within a day or two and while the ship was yet in port coming up behind him tapping him on the shoulder and beginning I beg your pardon mister Harmon I believe we were alike in bulk and stature but not otherwise and that we were not strikingly alike even in those respects when we were together and could be compared However a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between us and the weather was hot and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside his own and his first school had been at Brussels as mine had been and he had learnt French as I had learnt it and he had a little history of himself to relate God only knows how much of it true and how much of it false that had its likeness to mine I had been a seaman too So we got to be confidential together and the more easily yet because he and every one on board had known by general rumour what I was making the voyage to England for By such degrees and means he came to the knowledge of my uneasiness of mind and of its setting at that time in the direction of desiring to see and form some judgment of my allotted wife before she could possibly know me for myself also to try missus Boffin and give her a glad surprise So the plot was made out of our getting common sailors dresses as he was able to guide me about London and throwing ourselves in Bella Wilfer s neighbourhood and trying to put ourselves in her way and doing whatever chance might favour on the spot and seeing what came of it If nothing came of it I should be no worse off and there would merely be a short delay in my presenting myself to Lightwood I have all these facts right Yes They are all accurately right His advantage in all this was that for a time I was to be lost It might be for a day or for two days but I must be lost sight of on landing or there would be recognition anticipation and failure Therefore I disembarked with my valise in my hand as Potterson the steward and mister Jacob Kibble my fellow passenger afterwards remembered and waited for him in the dark by that very Limehouse Church which is now behind me As I had always shunned the port of London I only knew the church through his pointing out its spire from on board Perhaps I might recall if it were any good to try the way by which I went to it alone from the river but how we two went from it to Riderhood s shop I don t know any more than I know what turns we took and doubles we made after we left it The way was purposely confused no doubt But let me go on thinking the facts out and avoid confusing them with my speculations Whether he took me by a straight way or a crooked way what is that to the purpose now Steady John Harmon When we stopped at Riderhood s and he asked that scoundrel a question or two purporting to refer only to the lodging houses in which there was accommodation for us had I the least suspicion of him None Certainly none until afterwards when I held the clue I think he must have got from Riderhood in a paper the drug or whatever it was that afterwards stupefied me but I am far from sure All I felt safe in charging on him to night was old companionship in villainy between them Their undisguised intimacy and the character I now know Riderhood to bear made that not at all adventurous But I am not clear about the drug Thinking out the circumstances on which I found my suspicion they are only two One I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another after we came out which he had not touched before Two I now know Riderhood to have been previously taken up for being concerned in the robbery of an unlucky seaman to whom some such poison had been given It is my conviction that we cannot have gone a mile from that shop before we came to the wall the dark doorway the flight of stairs and the room The night was particularly dark and it rained hard As I think the circumstances back I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage which was not under cover The room overlooked the river or a dock or a creek and the tide was out Being possessed of the time down to that point I know by the hour that it must have been about low water but while the coffee was getting ready I drew back the curtain a dark brown curtain and looking out knew by the kind of reflection below of the few neighbouring lights that they were reflected in tidal mud He had carried under his arm a canvas bag containing a suit of his clothes I had no change of outer clothes with me as I was to buy slops You are very wet mister Harmon I can hear him saying and I am quite dry under this good waterproof coat Put on these clothes of mine You may find on trying them that they will answer your purpose to morrow as well as the slops you mean to buy or better While you change I ll hurry the hot coffee When he came back I had his clothes on and there was a black man with him wearing a linen jacket like a steward who put the smoking coffee on the table in a tray and never looked at me I am so far literal and exact Literal and exact I am certain Now I pass to sick and deranged impressions they are so strong that I rely upon them but there are spaces between them that I know nothing about and they are not pervaded by any idea of time I had drank some coffee when to my sense of sight he began to swell immensely and something urged me to rush at him We had a struggle near the door He got from me through my not knowing where to strike in the whirling round of the room and the flashing of flames of fire between us I dropped down Lying helpless on the ground I was turned over by a foot I was dragged by the neck into a corner I heard men speak together I was turned over by other feet I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed What might have been for anything I knew a silence of days weeks months years was broken by a violent wrestling of men all over the room The figure like myself was assailed and my valise was in its hand I was trodden upon and fallen over I heard a noise of blows and thought it was a wood cutter cutting down a tree I could not have said that my name was John Harmon I could not have thought it I didn t know it but when I heard the blows I thought of the wood cutter and his axe and had some dead idea that I was lying in a forest This is still correct Still correct with the exception that I cannot possibly express it to myself without using the word I But it was not I There was no such thing as I within my knowledge It was only after a downward slide through something like a tube and then a great noise and a sparkling and crackling as of fires that the consciousness came upon me This is John Harmon drowning John Harmon struggle for your life John Harmon call on Heaven and save yourself I think I cried it out aloud in a great agony and then a heavy horrid unintelligible something vanished and it was I who was struggling there alone in the water I was very weak and faint frightfully oppressed with drowsiness and driving fast with the tide Looking over the black water I saw the lights racing past me on the two banks of the river as if they were eager to be gone and leave me dying in the dark The tide was running down but I knew nothing of up or down then When guiding myself safely with Heaven s assistance before the fierce set of the water I at last caught at a boat moored one of a tier of boats at a causeway I was sucked under her and came up only just alive on the other side Was I long in the water Long enough to be chilled to the heart but I don t know how long Yet the cold was merciful for it was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of the causeway They naturally supposed me to have toppled in drunk when I crept to the public house it belonged to for I had no notion where I was and could not articulate through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech and I supposed the night to be the previous night as it was still dark and raining But I had lost twenty four hours I have checked the calculation often and it must have been two nights that I lay recovering in that public house Let me see Yes I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously and of proving Bella The dread of our being forced on one another and perpetuating the fate that seemed to have fallen on my father s riches the fate that they should lead to nothing but evil was strong upon the moral timidity that dates from my childhood with my poor sister As to this hour I cannot understand that side of the river where I recovered the shore being the opposite side to that on which I was ensnared I shall never understand it now Even at this moment while I leave the river behind me going home I cannot conceive that it rolls between me and that spot or that the sea is where it is But this is not thinking it out this is making a leap to the present time I could not have done it but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body Not a great fortune forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand But it was enough Without it I must have disclosed myself Without it I could never have gone to that Exchequer Coffee House or taken missus Wilfer s lodgings Some twelve days I lived at that hotel before the night when I saw the corpse of Radfoot at the Police Station The inexpressible mental horror that I laboured under as one of the consequences of the poison makes the interval seem greatly longer but I know it cannot have been longer That suffering has gradually weakened and weakened since and has only come upon me by starts and I hope I am free from it now but even now I have sometimes to think constrain myself and stop before speaking or I could not say the words I want to say Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end It is not so far to the end that I need be tempted to break off Now on straight I examined the newspapers every day for tidings that I was missing but saw none Going out that night to walk for I kept retired while it was light I found a crowd assembled round a placard posted at Whitehall It described myself John Harmon as found dead and mutilated in the river under circumstances of strong suspicion described my dress described the papers in my pockets and stated where I was lying for recognition In a wild incautious way I hurried there and there with the horror of the death I had escaped before my eyes in its most appalling shape added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me I perceived that Radfoot had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which he would have murdered me and that probably we had both been shot into the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide when the stream ran deep and strong That night I almost gave up my mystery though I suspected no one could offer no information knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I but Radfoot Next day while I hesitated and next day while I hesitated it seemed as if the whole country were determined to have me dead The Inquest declared me dead the Government proclaimed me dead I could not listen at my fireside for five minutes to the outer noises but it was borne into my ears that I was dead So John Harmon died and Julius Handford disappeared and John Rokesmith was born John Rokesmith s intent to night has been to repair a wrong that he could never have imagined possible coming to his ears through the Lightwood talk related to him and which he is bound by every consideration to remedy In that intent John Rokesmith will persevere as his duty is Now is it all thought out All to this time Nothing omitted No nothing But beyond this time To think it out through the future is a harder though a much shorter task than to think it out through the past John Harmon is dead Should John Harmon come to life If yes why If no why Take yes first To enlighten human Justice concerning the offence of one far beyond it who may have a living mother To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage a flight of stairs a brown window curtain and a black man To come into possession of my father s money and with it sordidly to buy a beautiful creature whom I love I cannot help it reason has nothing to do with it I love her against reason but who would as soon love me for my own sake as she would love the beggar at the corner What a use for the money and how worthy of its old misuses Now take no The reasons why John Harmon should not come to life Because he has passively allowed these dear old faithful friends to pass into possession of the property Because he sees them happy with it making a good use of it effacing the old rust and tarnish on the money Because they have virtually adopted Bella and will provide for her Because there is affection enough in her nature and warmth enough in her heart to develop into something enduringly good under favourable conditions Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my father s will and she is already growing better Because her marriage with John Harmon after what I have heard from her own lips would be a shocking mockery of which both she and I must always be conscious and which would degrade her in her mind and me in mine and each of us in the other s Because if John Harmon comes to life and does not marry her the property falls into the very hands that hold it now What would I have Dead I have found the true friends of my lifetime still as true as tender and as faithful as when I was alive and making my memory an incentive to good actions done in my name Dead I have found them when they might have slighted my name and passed greedily over my grave to ease and wealth lingering by the way like single hearted children to recall their love for me when I was a poor frightened child Dead I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived the revolting truth that I should have purchased her caring nothing for me as a Sultan buys a slave What would I have If the dead could know or do know how the living use them who among the hosts of dead has found a more disinterested fidelity on earth than I Is not that enough for me If I had come back these noble creatures would have welcomed me wept over me given up everything to me with joy I did not come back and they have passed unspoiled into my place Let them rest in it and let Bella rest in hers What course for me then This To live the same quiet Secretary life carefully avoiding chances of recognition until they shall have become more accustomed to their altered state and until the great swarm of swindlers under many names shall have found newer prey By that time the method I am establishing through all the affairs and with which I will every day take new pains to make them both familiar will be I may hope a machine in such working order as that they can keep it going I know I need but ask of their generosity to have When the right time comes I will ask no more than will replace me in my former path of life and John Rokesmith shall tread it as contentedly as he may But John Harmon shall come back no more That I may never in the days to come afar off have any weak misgiving that Bella might in any contingency have taken me for my own sake if I had plainly asked her I WILL plainly ask her proving beyond all question what I already know too well And now it is all thought out from the beginning to the end and my mind is easier So deeply engaged had the living dead man been in thus communing with himself that he had regarded neither the wind nor the way and had resisted the former instinctively as he had pursued the latter But being now come into the City where there was a coach stand he stood irresolute whether to go to his lodgings or to go first to mister Boffin s house He decided to go round by the house arguing as he carried his overcoat upon his arm that it was less likely to attract notice if left there than if taken to Holloway both missus Wilfer and Miss Lavinia being ravenously curious touching every article of which the lodger stood possessed Arriving at the house he found that mister and missus Boffin were out but that Miss Wilfer was in the drawing room Miss Wilfer had remained at home in consequence of not feeling very well and had inquired in the evening if mister Rokesmith were in his room Make my compliments to Miss Wilfer and say I am here now Miss Wilfer s compliments came down in return and if it were not too much trouble would mister Rokesmith be so kind as to come up before he went It was not too much trouble and mister Rokesmith came up Oh she looked very pretty she looked very very pretty If the father of the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his son and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself and had the happiness to make her loving as well as loveable Dear me Are you not well mister Rokesmith Yes quite well I was sorry to hear when I came in that YOU were not A mere nothing I had a headache gone now and was not quite fit for a hot theatre so I stayed at home I asked you if you were not well because you look so white Do I I have had a busy evening She was on a low ottoman before the fire with a little shining jewel of a table and her book and her work beside her Ah what a different life the late John Harmon s if it had been his happy privilege to take his place upon that ottoman and draw his arm about that waist and say I hope the time has been long without me What a Home Goddess you look my darling But the present John Rokesmith far removed from the late John Harmon remained standing at a distance A little distance in respect of space but a great distance in respect of separation mister Rokesmith said Bella taking up her work and inspecting it all round the corners I wanted to say something to you when I could have the opportunity as an explanation why I was rude to you the other day You have no right to think ill of me sir The sharp little way in which she darted a look at him half sensitively injured and half pettishly would have been very much admired by the late John Harmon You don t know how well I think of you Miss Wilfer Truly you must have a very high opinion of me mister Rokesmith when you believe that in prosperity I neglect and forget my old home Do I believe so You DID sir at any rate returned Bella I took the liberty of reminding you of a little omission into which you had fallen insensibly and naturally fallen It was no more than that And I beg leave to ask you mister Rokesmith said Bella why you took that liberty I hope there is no offence in the phrase it is your own remember Because I am truly deeply profoundly interested in you Miss Wilfer Because I wish to see you always at your best Because I shall I go on No sir returned Bella with a burning face you have said more than enough I beg that you will NOT go on If you have any generosity any honour you will say no more The late John Harmon looking at the proud face with the down cast eyes and at the quick breathing as it stirred the fall of bright brown hair over the beautiful neck would probably have remained silent I wish to speak to you sir said Bella once for all and I don t know how to do it I have sat here all this evening wishing to speak to you and determining to speak to you and feeling that I must I beg for a moment s time He remained silent and she remained with her face averted sometimes making a slight movement as if she would turn and speak At length she did so You know how I am situated here sir and you know how I am situated at home I must speak to you for myself since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so It is not generous in you it is not honourable in you to conduct yourself towards me as you do Is it ungenerous or dishonourable to be devoted to you fascinated by you Preposterous said Bella The late John Harmon might have thought it rather a contemptuous and lofty word of repudiation I now feel obliged to go on pursued the Secretary though it were only in self explanation and self defence I hope Miss Wilfer that it is not unpardonable even in me to make an honest declaration of an honest devotion to you An honest declaration repeated Bella with emphasis Is it otherwise I must request sir said Bella taking refuge in a touch of timely resentment that I may not be questioned You must excuse me if I decline to be cross examined Oh Miss Wilfer this is hardly charitable I ask you nothing but what your own emphasis suggests However I waive even that question But what I have declared I take my stand by I cannot recall the avowal of my earnest and deep attachment to you and I do not recall it I reject it sir said Bella I should be blind and deaf if I were not prepared for the reply Forgive my offence for it carries its punishment with it What punishment asked Bella Is my present endurance none But excuse me I did not mean to cross examine you again You take advantage of a hasty word of mine said Bella with a little sting of self reproach to make me seem I don t know what I spoke without consideration when I used it If that was bad I am sorry but you repeat it after consideration and that seems to me to be at least no better For the rest I beg it may be understood mister Rokesmith that there is an end of this between us now and for ever Now and for ever he repeated Yes I appeal to you sir proceeded Bella with increasing spirit not to pursue me I appeal to you not to take advantage of your position in this house to make my position in it distressing and disagreeable I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced attentions as plain to missus Boffin as to me Have I done so I should think you have replied Bella In any case it is not your fault if you have not mister Rokesmith I hope you are wrong in that impression I should be very sorry to have justified it I think I have not For the future there is no apprehension It is all over I am much relieved to hear it said Bella I have far other views in life and why should you waste your own Mine said the Secretary My life His curious tone caused Bella to glance at the curious smile with which he said it It was gone as he glanced back Pardon me Miss Wilfer he proceeded when their eyes met you have used some hard words for which I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind that I do not understand Ungenerous and dishonourable In what I would rather not be asked said Bella haughtily looking down I would rather not ask but the question is imposed upon me Kindly explain or if not kindly justly Oh sir said Bella raising her eyes to his after a little struggle to forbear is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with mister and missus Boffin and your ability in your place give you against me Against you Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like and which I tell you that I utterly reject The late John Harmon could have borne a good deal but he would have been cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this Would it be generous and honourable to step into your place if you did so for I don t know that you did and I hope you did not anticipating or knowing beforehand that I should come here and designing to take me at this disadvantage This mean and cruel disadvantage said the Secretary Yes assented Bella The Secretary kept silence for a little while then merely said You are wholly mistaken Miss Wilfer wonderfully mistaken I cannot say however that it is your fault If I deserve better things of you you do not know it At least sir retorted Bella with her old indignation rising you know the history of my being here at all I have heard mister Boffin say that you are master of every line and word of that will as you are master of all his affairs And was it not enough that I should have been willed away like a horse or a dog or a bird but must you too begin to dispose of me in your mind and speculate in me as soon as I had ceased to be the talk and the laugh of the town Am I for ever to be made the property of strangers Believe me returned the Secretary you are wonderfully mistaken I should be glad to know it answered Bella I doubt if you ever will Good night Of course I shall be careful to conceal any traces of this interview from mister and missus Boffin as long as I remain here Trust me what you have complained of is at an end for ever I am glad I have spoken then mister Rokesmith It has been painful and difficult but it is done If I have hurt you I hope you will forgive me I am inexperienced and impetuous and I have been a little spoilt but I really am not so bad as I dare say I appear or as you think me He quitted the room when Bella had said this relenting in her wilful inconsistent way Left alone she threw herself back on her ottoman and said I didn t know the lovely woman was such a Dragon Then she got up and looked in the glass and said to her image You have been positively swelling your features you little fool Then she took an impatient walk to the other end of the room and back and said I wish Pa was here to have a talk about an avaricious marriage but he is better away poor dear for I know I should pull his hair if he WAS here And then she threw her work away and threw her book after it and sat down and hummed a tune and hummed it out of tune and quarrelled with it And John Rokesmith what did he He went down to his room and buried John Harmon many additional fathoms deep He took his hat and walked out and as he went to Holloway or anywhere else not at all minding where heaped mounds upon mounds of earth over John Harmon s grave His walking did not bring him home until the dawn of day And so busy had he been all night piling and piling weights upon weights of earth above John Harmon s grave that by that time John Harmon lay buried under a whole Alpine range and still the Sexton Rokesmith accumulated mountains over him lightening his labour with the dirge Cover him crush him keep him down Chapter fourteen STRONG OF PURPOSE The sexton task of piling earth above John Harmon all night long was not conducive to sound sleep but Rokesmith had some broken morning rest and rose strengthened in his purpose It was all over now No ghost should trouble mister and missus Boffin s peace invisible and voiceless the ghost should look on for a little while longer at the state of existence out of which it had departed and then should for ever cease to haunt the scenes in which it had no place He went over it all again He had lapsed into the condition in which he found himself as many a man lapses into many a condition without perceiving the accumulative power of its separate circumstances When in the distrust engendered by his wretched childhood and the action for evil never yet for good within his knowledge then of his father and his father s wealth on all within their influence he conceived the idea of his first deception it was meant to be harmless it was to last but a few hours or days it was to involve in it only the girl so capriciously forced upon him and upon whom he was so capriciously forced and it was honestly meant well towards her For if he had found her unhappy in the prospect of that marriage through her heart inclining to another man or for any other cause he would seriously have said This is another of the old perverted uses of the misery making money I will let it go to my and my sister s only protectors and friends When the snare into which he fell so outstripped his first intention as that he found himself placarded by the police authorities upon the London walls for dead he confusedly accepted the aid that fell upon him without considering how firmly it must seem to fix the Boffins in their accession to the fortune When he saw them and knew them and even from his vantage ground of inspection could find no flaw in them he asked himself And shall I come to life to dispossess such people as these There was no good to set against the putting of them to that hard proof He had heard from Bella s own lips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking the lodgings that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly mercenary He had since tried her in his own unknown person and supposed station and she not only rejected his advances but resented them Was it for him to have the shame of buying her or the meanness of punishing her Yet by coming to life and accepting the condition of the inheritance he must do the former and by coming to life and rejecting it he must do the latter Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed was the implication of an innocent man in his supposed murder He would obtain complete retraction from the accuser and set the wrong right but clearly the wrong could never have been done if he had never planned a deception Then whatever inconvenience or distress of mind the deception cost him it was manful repentantly to accept as among its consequences and make no complaint Thus John Rokesmith in the morning and it buried John Harmon still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night Going out earlier than he was accustomed to do he encountered the cherub at the door The cherub s way was for a certain space his way and they walked together It was impossible not to notice the change in the cherub s appearance The cherub felt very conscious of it and modestly remarked A present from my daughter Bella mister Rokesmith The words gave the Secretary a stroke of pleasure for he remembered the fifty pounds and he still loved the girl No doubt it was very weak it always IS very weak some authorities hold but he loved the girl I don t know whether you happen to have read many books of African Travel mister Rokesmith said R W I have read several Well you know there s usually a King George or a King Boy or a King Sambo or a King Bill or Bull or Rum or Junk or whatever name the sailors may have happened to give him Where asked Rokesmith Anywhere Anywhere in Africa I mean Pretty well everywhere I may say for black kings are cheap and I think said R W with an apologetic air nasty I am much of your opinion mister Wilfer You were going to say I was going to say the king is generally dressed in a London hat only or a Manchester pair of braces or one epaulette or an uniform coat with his legs in the sleeves or something of that kind Just so said the Secretary In confidence I assure you mister Rokesmith observed the cheerful cherub that when more of my family were at home and to be provided for I used to remind myself immensely of that king You have no idea as a single man of the difficulty I have had in wearing more than one good article at a time I can easily believe it mister Wilfer I only mention it said R W in the warmth of his heart as a proof of the amiable delicate and considerate affection of my daughter Bella If she had been a little spoilt I couldn t have thought so very much of it under the circumstances But no not a bit And she is so very pretty I hope you agree with me in finding her very pretty mister Rokesmith Certainly I do Every one must I hope so said the cherub Indeed I have no doubt of it This is a great advancement for her in life mister Rokesmith A great opening of her prospects Miss Wilfer could have no better friends than mister and missus Boffin Impossible said the gratified cherub Really I begin to think things are very well as they are If mister John Harmon had lived He is better dead said the Secretary No I won t go so far as to say that urged the cherub a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone but he mightn t have suited Bella or Bella mightn t have suited him or fifty things whereas now I hope she can choose for herself Has she as you place the confidence in me of speaking on the subject you will excuse my asking has she perhaps chosen faltered the Secretary Oh dear no returned R W Young ladies sometimes Rokesmith hinted choose without mentioning their choice to their fathers Not in this case mister Rokesmith Between my daughter Bella and me there is a regular league and covenant of confidence It was ratified only the other day The ratification dates from these said the cherub giving a little pull at the lappels of his coat and the pockets of his trousers Oh no she has not chosen To be sure young George Sampson in the days when mister John Harmon Who I wish had never been born said the Secretary with a gloomy brow R W looked at him with surprise as thinking he had contracted an unaccountable spite against the poor deceased and continued In the days when mister John Harmon was being sought out young George Sampson certainly was hovering about Bella and Bella let him hover But it never was seriously thought of and it s still less than ever to be thought of now For Bella is ambitious mister Rokesmith and I think I may predict will marry fortune This time you see she will have the person and the property before her together and will be able to make her choice with her eyes open This is my road I am very sorry to part company so soon Good morning sir The Secretary pursued his way not very much elevated in spirits by this conversation and arriving at the Boffin mansion found Betty Higden waiting for him I should thank you kindly sir said Betty if I might make so bold as have a word or two wi you She should have as many words as she liked he told her and took her into his room and made her sit down Tis concerning Sloppy sir said Betty And that s how I come here by myself Not wishing him to know what I m a going to say to you I got the start of him early and walked up You have wonderful energy returned Rokesmith You are as young as I am Betty Higden gravely shook her head I am strong for my time of life sir but not young thank the Lord Are you thankful for not being young Yes sir If I was young it would all have to be gone through again and the end would be a weary way off don t you see But never mind me tis concerning Sloppy And what about him Betty Tis just this sir It can t be reasoned out of his head by any powers of mine but what that he can do right by your kind lady and gentleman and do his work for me both together Now he can t To give himself up to being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on he must give me up Well he won t I respect him for it said Rokesmith DO ye sir I don t know but what I do myself Still that don t make it right to let him have his way So as he won t give me up I m a going to give him up How Betty I m a going to run away from him With an astonished look at the indomitable old face and the bright eyes the Secretary repeated Run away from him Yes sir said Betty with one nod And in the nod and in the firm set of her mouth there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted Come come said the Secretary We must talk about this Let us take our time over it and try to get at the true sense of the case and the true course by degrees Now lookee here by dear returned old Betty asking your excuse for being so familiar but being of a time of life a most to be your grandmother twice over Now lookee here Tis a poor living and a hard as is to be got out of this work that I m a doing now and but for Sloppy I don t know as I should have held to it this long But it did just keep us on the two together Now that I m alone with even Johnny gone I d far sooner be upon my feet and tiring of myself out than a sitting folding and folding by the fire And I ll tell you why There s a deadness steals over me at times that the kind of life favours and I don t like Now I seem to have Johnny in my arms now his mother now his mother s mother now I seem to be a child myself a lying once again in the arms of my own mother then I get numbed thought and sense till I start out of my seat afeerd that I m a growing like the poor old people that they brick up in the Unions as you may sometimes see when they let em out of the four walls to have a warm in the sun crawling quite scared about the streets I was a nimble girl and have always been a active body as I told your lady first time ever I see her good face I can still walk twenty mile if I am put to it I d far better be a walking than a getting numbed and dreary I m a good fair knitter and can make many little things to sell The loan from your lady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with would be a fortune for me Trudging round the country and tiring of myself out I shall keep the deadness off and get my own bread by my own labour And what more can I want And this is your plan said the Secretary for running away Show me a better My deary show me a better Why I know very well said old Betty Higden and you know very well that your lady and gentleman would set me up like a queen for the rest of my life if so be that we could make it right among us to have it so But we can t make it right among us to have it so I ve never took charity yet nor yet has any one belonging to me And it would be forsaking of myself indeed and forsaking of my children dead and gone and forsaking of their children dead and gone to set up a contradiction now at last It might come to be justifiable and unavoidable at last the Secretary gently hinted with a slight stress on the word I hope it never will It ain t that I mean to give offence by being anyways proud said the old creature simply but that I want to be of a piece like and helpful of myself right through to my death And to be sure added the Secretary as a comfort for her Sloppy will be eagerly looking forward to his opportunity of being to you what you have been to him Trust him for that sir said Betty cheerfully Though he had need to be something quick about it for I m a getting to be an old one But I m a strong one too and travel and weather never hurt me yet Now be so kind as speak for me to your lady and gentleman and tell em what I ask of their good friendliness to let me do and why I ask it The Secretary felt that there was no gainsaying what was urged by this brave old heroine and he presently repaired to missus Boffin and recommended her to let Betty Higden have her way at all events for the time It would be far more satisfactory to your kind heart I know he said to provide for her but it may be a duty to respect this independent spirit missus Boffin was not proof against the consideration set before her She and her husband had worked too and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps If they owed a duty to Betty Higden of a surety that duty must be done But Betty said missus Boffin when she accompanied John Rokesmith back to his room and shone upon her with the light of her radiant face granted all else I think I wouldn t run away Twould come easier to Sloppy said missus Higden shaking her head Twould come easier to me too But tis as you please When would you go Now was the bright and ready answer To day my deary to morrow Bless ye I am used to it I know many parts of the country well When nothing else was to be done I have worked in many a market garden afore now and in many a hop garden too If I give my consent to your going Betty which mister Rokesmith thinks I ought to do Betty thanked him with a grateful curtsey We must not lose sight of you We must not let you pass out of our knowledge We must know all about you Yes my deary but not through letter writing because letter writing indeed writing of most sorts hadn t much come up for such as me when I was young But I shall be to and fro No fear of my missing a chance of giving myself a sight of your reviving face Besides said Betty with logical good faith I shall have a debt to pay off by littles and naturally that would bring me back if nothing else would MUST it be done asked missus Boffin still reluctant of the Secretary I think it must After more discussion it was agreed that it should be done and missus Boffin summoned Bella to note down the little purchases that were necessary to set Betty up in trade Don t ye be timorous for me my dear said the stanch old heart observant of Bella s face when I take my seat with my work clean and busy and fresh in a country market place I shall turn a sixpence as sure as ever a farmer s wife there The Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical question of mister Sloppy s capabilities He would have made a wonderful cabinet maker said missus Higden if there had been the money to put him to it She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle or to knock a broken piece of furniture together in a surprising manner As to constructing toys for the Minders out of nothing he had done that daily And once as many as a dozen people had got together in the lane to see the neatness with which he fitted the broken pieces of a foreign monkey s musical instrument That s well said the Secretary It will not be hard to find a trade for him John Harmon being buried under mountains now the Secretary that very same day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him He drew up an ample declaration to be signed by Rogue Riderhood knowing he could get his signature to it by making him another and much shorter evening call and then considered to whom should he give the document To Hexam s son or daughter Resolved speedily to the daughter But it would be safer to avoid seeing the daughter because the son had seen Julius Handford and he could not be too careful there might possibly be some comparison of notes between the son and daughter which would awaken slumbering suspicion and lead to consequences I might even he reflected be apprehended as having been concerned in my own murder Therefore best to send it to the daughter under cover by the post Pleasant Riderhood had undertaken to find out where she lived and it was not necessary that it should be attended by a single word of explanation So far straight But all that he knew of the daughter he derived from missus Boffin s accounts of what she heard from mister Lightwood who seemed to have a reputation for his manner of relating a story and to have made this story quite his own It interested him and he would like to have the means of knowing more as for instance that she received the exonerating paper and that it satisfied her by opening some channel altogether independent of Lightwood who likewise had seen Julius Handford who had publicly advertised for Julius Handford and whom of all men he the Secretary most avoided But with whom the common course of things might bring me in a moment face to face any day in the week or any hour in the day Now to cast about for some likely means of opening such a channel The boy Hexam was training for and with a schoolmaster The Secretary knew it because his sister s share in that disposal of him seemed to be the best part of Lightwood s account of the family This young fellow Sloppy stood in need of some instruction If he the Secretary engaged that schoolmaster to impart it to him the channel might be opened The next point was did missus Boffin know the schoolmaster s name No but she knew where the school was Quite enough Promptly the Secretary wrote to the master of that school and that very evening Bradley Headstone answered in person The Secretary stated to the schoolmaster how the object was to send to him for certain occasional evening instruction a youth whom mister and missus Boffin wished to help to an industrious and useful place in life The schoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil The Secretary inquired on what terms The schoolmaster stated on what terms Agreed and disposed of May I ask sir said Bradley Headstone to whose good opinion I owe a recommendation to you You should know that I am not the principal here I am mister Boffin s Secretary mister Boffin is a gentleman who inherited a property of which you may have heard some public mention the Harmon property mister Harmon said Bradley who would have been a great deal more at a loss than he was if he had known to whom he spoke was murdered and found in the river Was murdered and found in the river It was not No interposed the Secretary smiling it was not he who recommended you mister Boffin heard of you through a certain mister Lightwood I think you know mister Lightwood or know of him I know as much of him as I wish to know sir I have no acquaintance with mister Lightwood and I desire none I have no objection to mister Lightwood but I have a particular objection to some of mister Lightwood s friends in short to one of mister Lightwood s friends His great friend He could hardly get the words out even then and there so fierce did he grow though keeping himself down with infinite pains of repression when the careless and contemptuous bearing of Eugene Wrayburn rose before his mind The Secretary saw there was a strong feeling here on some sore point and he would have made a diversion from it but for Bradley s holding to it in his cumbersome way I have no objection to mention the friend by name he said doggedly The person I object to is mister Eugene Wrayburn The Secretary remembered him In his disturbed recollection of that night when he was striving against the drugged drink there was but a dim image of Eugene s person but he remembered his name and his manner of speaking and how he had gone with them to view the body and where he had stood and what he had said Pray mister Headstone what is the name he asked again trying to make a diversion of young Hexam s sister Her name is Lizzie said the schoolmaster with a strong contraction of his whole face She is a young woman of a remarkable character is she not She is sufficiently remarkable to be very superior to mister Eugene Wrayburn though an ordinary person might be that said the schoolmaster and I hope you will not think it impertinent in me sir to ask why you put the two names together By mere accident returned the Secretary Observing that mister Wrayburn was a disagreeable subject with you I tried to get away from it though not very successfully it would appear Do you know mister Wrayburn sir No Then perhaps the names cannot be put together on the authority of any representation of his Certainly not I took the liberty to ask said Bradley after casting his eyes on the ground because he is capable of making any representation in the swaggering levity of his insolence I I hope you will not misunderstand me sir I I am much interested in this brother and sister and the subject awakens very strong feelings within me Very very strong feelings With a shaking hand Bradley took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow The Secretary thought as he glanced at the schoolmaster s face that he had opened a channel here indeed and that it was an unexpectedly dark and deep and stormy one and difficult to sound All at once in the midst of his turbulent emotions Bradley stopped and seemed to challenge his look Much as though he suddenly asked him What do you see in me The brother young Hexam was your real recommendation here said the Secretary quietly going back to the point mister and missus Boffin happening to know through mister Lightwood that he was your pupil Anything that I ask respecting the brother and sister or either of them I ask for myself out of my own interest in the subject and not in my official character or on mister Boffin s behalf How I come to be interested I need not explain You know the father s connection with the discovery of mister Harmon s body Sir replied Bradley very restlessly indeed I know all the circumstances of that case Pray tell me mister Headstone said the Secretary Does the sister suffer under any stigma because of the impossible accusation groundless would be a better word that was made against the father and substantially withdrawn No sir returned Bradley with a kind of anger I am very glad to hear it The sister said Bradley separating his words over carefully and speaking as if he were repeating them from a book suffers under no reproach that repels a man of unimpeachable character who had made for himself every step of his way in life from placing her in his own station I will not say raising her to his own station I say placing her in it The sister labours under no reproach unless she should unfortunately make it for herself When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her I think the fact must be taken to be pretty expressive And there is such a man said the Secretary Bradley Headstone knotted his brows and squared his large lower jaw and fixed his eyes on the ground with an air of determination that seemed unnecessary to the occasion as he replied And there is such a man The Secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation and it ended here Within three hours the oakum headed apparition once more dived into the Leaving Shop and that night Rogue Riderhood s recantation lay in the post office addressed under cover to Lizzie Hexam at her right address All these proceedings occupied John Rokesmith so much that it was not until the following day that he saw Bella again It seemed then to be tacitly understood between them that they were to be as distantly easy as they could without attracting the attention of mister and missus Boffin to any marked change in their manner The fitting out of old Betty Higden was favourable to this as keeping Bella engaged and interested and as occupying the general attention I think said Rokesmith when they all stood about her while she packed her tidy basket except Bella who was busily helping on her knees at the chair on which it stood that at least you might keep a letter in your pocket missus Higden which I would write for you and date from here merely stating in the names of mister and missus Boffin that they are your friends I won t say patrons because they wouldn t like it No no no said mister Boffin no patronizing Let s keep out of THAT whatever we come to There s more than enough of that about without us ain t there Noddy said missus Boffin I believe you old lady returned the Golden Dustman Overmuch indeed But people sometimes like to be patronized don t they sir asked Bella looking up I don t And if THEY do my dear they ought to learn better said mister Boffin Patrons and Patronesses and Vice Patrons and Vice Patronesses and Deceased Patrons and Deceased Patronesses and Ex Vice Patrons and Ex Vice Patronesses what does it all mean in the books of the Charities that come pouring in on Rokesmith as he sits among em pretty well up to his neck If mister Tom Noakes gives his five shillings ain t he a Patron and if missus Jack Styles gives her five shillings ain t she a Patroness What the deuce is it all about If it ain t stark staring impudence what do you call it Don t be warm Noddy missus Boffin urged Warm cried mister Boffin It s enough to make a man smoking hot I can t go anywhere without being Patronized I don t want to be Patronized If I buy a ticket for a Flower Show or a Music Show or any sort of Show and pay pretty heavy for it why am I to be Patroned and Patronessed as if the Patrons and Patronesses treated me If there s a good thing to be done can t it be done on its own merits If there s a bad thing to be done can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right Yet when a new Institution s going to be built it seems to me that the bricks and mortar ain t made of half so much consequence as the Patrons and Patronesses no nor yet the objects I wish somebody would tell me whether other countries get Patronized to anything like the extent of this one And as to the Patrons and Patronesses themselves I wonder they re not ashamed of themselves They ain t Pills or Hair Washes or Invigorating Nervous Essences to be puffed in that way Having delivered himself of these remarks mister Boffin took a trot according to his usual custom and trotted back to the spot from which he had started As to the letter Rokesmith said mister Boffin you re as right as a trivet Give her the letter make her take the letter put it in her pocket by violence She might fall sick You know you might fall sick said mister Boffin Don t deny it missus Higden in your obstinacy you know you might Old Betty laughed and said that she would take the letter and be thankful That s right said mister Boffin Come That s sensible And don t be thankful to us for we never thought of it but to mister Rokesmith The letter was written and read to her and given to her Now how do you feel said mister Boffin Do you like it The letter sir said Betty Ay it s a beautiful letter No no no not the letter said mister Boffin the idea Are you sure you re strong enough to carry out the idea I shall be stronger and keep the deadness off better this way than any way left open to me sir Don t say than any way left open you know urged mister Boffin because there are ways without end A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the Bower for instance Wouldn t you like to see the Bower and know a retired literary man of the name of Wegg that lives there WITH a wooden leg Old Betty was proof even against this temptation and fell to adjusting her black bonnet and shawl I wouldn t let you go now it comes to this after all said mister Boffin if I didn t hope that it may make a man and a workman of Sloppy in as short a time as ever a man and workman was made yet Why what have you got there Betty Not a doll It was the man in the Guards who had been on duty over Johnny s bed The solitary old woman showed what it was and put it up quietly in her dress Then she gratefully took leave of missus Boffin and of mister Boffin and of Rokesmith and then put her old withered arms round Bella s young and blooming neck and said repeating Johnny s words A kiss for the boofer lady The Secretary looked on from a doorway at the boofer lady thus encircled and still looked on at the boofer lady standing alone there when the determined old figure with its steady bright eyes was trudging through the streets away from paralysis and pauperism Chapter fifteen THE WHOLE CASE SO FAR Bradley Headstone held fast by that other interview he was to have with Lizzie Hexam In stipulating for it he had been impelled by a feeling little short of desperation and the feeling abided by him It was very soon after his interview with the Secretary that he and Charley Hexam set out one leaden evening not unnoticed by Miss Peecher to have this desperate interview accomplished That dolls dressmaker said Bradley is favourable neither to me nor to you Hexam A pert crooked little chit mister Headstone I knew she would put herself in the way if she could and would be sure to strike in with something impertinent It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to night and meeting my sister So I supposed said Bradley getting his gloves on his nervous hands as he walked So I supposed Nobody but my sister pursued Charley would have found out such an extraordinary companion She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another She told me so that night when we went there Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker asked Bradley Oh said the boy colouring One of her romantic ideas I tried to convince her so but I didn t succeed However what we have got to do is to succeed to night mister Headstone and then all the rest follows You are still sanguine Hexam Certainly I am sir Why we have everything on our side Except your sister perhaps thought Bradley But he only gloomily thought it and said nothing Everything on our side repeated the boy with boyish confidence Respectability an excellent connexion for me common sense everything To be sure your sister has always shown herself a devoted sister said Bradley willing to sustain himself on even that low ground of hope Naturally mister Headstone I have a good deal of influence with her And now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me first I say again we have everything on our side And Bradley thought again Except your sister perhaps A grey dusty withered evening in London city has not a hopeful aspect The closed warehouses and offices have an air of death about them and the national dread of colour has an air of mourning The towers and steeples of the many house encompassed churches dark and dingy as the sky that seems descending on them are no relief to the general gloom a sun dial on a church wall has the look in its useless black shade of having failed in its business enterprise and stopped payment for ever melancholy waifs and strays of housekeepers and porter sweep melancholy waifs and strays of papers and pins into the kennels and other more melancholy waifs and strays explore them searching and stooping and poking for anything to sell The set of humanity outward from the City is as a set of prisoners departing from gaol and dismal Newgate seems quite as fit a stronghold for the mighty Lord Mayor as his own state dwelling On such an evening when the city grit gets into the hair and eyes and skin and when the fallen leaves of the few unhappy city trees grind down in corners under wheels of wind the schoolmaster and the pupil emerged upon the Leadenhall Street region spying eastward for Lizzie Being something too soon in their arrival they lurked at a corner waiting for her to appear The best looking among us will not look very well lurking at a corner and Bradley came out of that disadvantage very poorly indeed Here she comes mister Headstone Let us go forward and meet her As they advanced she saw them coming and seemed rather troubled But she greeted her brother with the usual warmth and touched the extended hand of Bradley Why where are you going Charley dear she asked him then Nowhere We came on purpose to meet you To meet me Charley Yes We are going to walk with you But don t let us take the great leading streets where every one walks and we can t hear ourselves speak Let us go by the quiet backways Here s a large paved court by this church and quiet too Let us go up here But it s not in the way Charley Yes it is said the boy petulantly It s in my way and my way is yours She had not released his hand and still holding it looked at him with a kind of appeal He avoided her eyes under pretence of saying Come along mister Headstone Bradley walked at his side not at hers and the brother and sister walked hand in hand The court brought them to a churchyard a paved square court with a raised bank of earth about breast high in the middle enclosed by iron rails Here conveniently and healthfully elevated above the level of the living were the dead and the tombstones some of the latter droopingly inclined from the perpendicular as if they were ashamed of the lies they told They paced the whole of this place once in a constrained and uncomfortable manner when the boy stopped and said Lizzie mister Headstone has something to say to you I don t wish to be an interruption either to him or to you and so I ll go and take a little stroll and come back I know in a general way what mister Headstone intends to say and I very highly approve of it as I hope and indeed I do not doubt you will I needn t tell you Lizzie that I am under great obligations to mister Headstone and that I am very anxious for mister Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes As I hope and as indeed I don t doubt you must be Charley returned his sister detaining his hand as he withdrew it I think you had better stay I think mister Headstone had better not say what he thinks of saying Why how do you know what it is returned the boy Perhaps I don t but Perhaps you don t No Liz I should think not If you knew what it was you would give me a very different answer There let go be sensible I wonder you don t remember that mister Headstone is looking on She allowed him to separate himself from her and he after saying Now Liz be a rational girl and a good sister walked away She remained standing alone with Bradley Headstone and it was not until she raised her eyes that he spoke I said he began when I saw you last that there was something unexplained which might perhaps influence you I have come this evening to explain it I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner when I speak to you You see me at my greatest disadvantage It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best and that I know you see me at my worst She moved slowly on when he paused and he moved slowly on beside her It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about myself he resumed but whatever I say to you seems even in my own ears below what I want to say and different from what I want to say I can t help it So it is You are the ruin of me She started at the passionate sound of the last words and at the passionate action of his hands with which they were accompanied Yes you are the ruin the ruin the ruin of me I have no resources in myself I have no confidence in myself I have no government of myself when you are near me or in my thoughts And you are always in my thoughts now I have never been quit of you since I first saw you Oh that was a wretched day for me That was a wretched miserable day A touch of pity for him mingled with her dislike of him and she said mister Headstone I am grieved to have done you any harm but I have never meant it There he cried despairingly Now I seem to have reproached you instead of revealing to you the state of my own mind Bear with me I am always wrong when you are in question It is my doom Struggling with himself and by times looking up at the deserted windows of the houses as if there could be anything written in their grimy panes that would help him he paced the whole pavement at her side before he spoke again I must try to give expression to what is in my mind it shall and must be spoken Though you see me so confounded though you strike me so helpless I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well of me that there are some people who highly esteem me that I have in my way won a Station which is considered worth winning Surely mister Headstone I do believe it Surely I have always known it from Charley I ask you to believe that if I were to offer my home such as it is my station such as it is my affections such as they are to any one of the best considered and best qualified and most distinguished among the young women engaged in my calling they would probably be accepted Even readily accepted I do not doubt it said Lizzie with her eyes upon the ground I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle down as many men of my class do I on the one side of a school my wife on the other both of us interested in the same work Why have you not done so asked Lizzie Hexam Why do you not do so Far better that I never did The only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks he said always speaking passionately and when most emphatic repeating that former action of his hands which was like flinging his heart s blood down before her in drops upon the pavement stones the only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks is that I never did For if I had and if the same spell had come upon me for my ruin I know I should have broken that tie asunder as if it had been thread She glanced at him with a glance of fear and a shrinking gesture He answered as if she had spoken No It would not have been voluntary on my part any more than it is voluntary in me to be here now You draw me to you If I were shut up in a strong prison you would draw me out I should break through the wall to come to you If I were lying on a sick bed you would draw me up to stagger to your feet and fall there The wild energy of the man now quite let loose was absolutely terrible He stopped and laid his hand upon a piece of the coping of the burial ground enclosure as if he would have dislodged the stone No man knows till the time comes what depths are within him To some men it never comes let them rest and be thankful To me you brought it on me you forced it and the bottom of this raging sea striking himself upon the breast has been heaved up ever since mister Headstone I have heard enough Let me stop you here It will be better for you and better for me Let us find my brother Not yet It shall and must be spoken I have been in torments ever since I stopped short of it before You are alarmed It is another of my miseries that I cannot speak to you or speak of you without stumbling at every syllable unless I let the check go altogether and run mad Here is a man lighting the lamps He will be gone directly I entreat of you let us walk round this place again You have no reason to look alarmed I can restrain myself and I will She yielded to the entreaty how could she do otherwise and they paced the stones in silence One by one the lights leaped up making the cold grey church tower more remote and they were alone again He said no more until they had regained the spot where he had broken off there he again stood still and again grasped the stone In saying what he said then he never looked at her but looked at it and wrenched at it You know what I am going to say I love you What other men may mean when they use that expression I cannot tell what I mean is that I am under the influence of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted in vain and which overmasters me You could draw me to fire you could draw me to water you could draw me to the gallows you could draw me to any death you could draw me to anything I have most avoided you could draw me to any exposure and disgrace This and the confusion of my thoughts so that I am fit for nothing is what I mean by your being the ruin of me But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer of myself in marriage you could draw me to any good every good with equal force My circumstances are quite easy and you would want for nothing My reputation stands quite high and would be a shield for yours If you saw me at my work able to do it well and respected in it you might even come to take a sort of pride in me I would try hard that you should Whatever considerations I may have thought of against this offer I have conquered and I make it with all my heart Your brother favours me to the utmost and it is likely that we might live and work together anyhow it is certain that he would have my best influence and support I don t know what I could say more if I tried I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is I only add that if it is any claim on you to be in earnest I am in thorough earnest dreadful earnest The powdered mortar from under the stone at which he wrenched rattled on the pavement to confirm his words mister Headstone Stop I implore you before you answer me to walk round this place once more It will give you a minute s time to think and me a minute s time to get some fortitude together Again she yielded to the entreaty and again they came back to the same place and again he worked at the stone Is it he said with his attention apparently engrossed by it yes or no mister Headstone I thank you sincerely I thank you gratefully and hope you may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy But it is no Is no short time necessary for reflection no weeks or days he asked in the same half suffocated way None whatever Are you quite decided and is there no chance of any change in my favour I am quite decided mister Headstone and I am bound to answer I am certain there is none Then said he suddenly changing his tone and turning to her and bringing his clenched hand down upon the stone with a force that laid the knuckles raw and bleeding then I hope that I may never kill him The dark look of hatred and revenge with which the words broke from his livid lips and with which he stood holding out his smeared hand as if it held some weapon and had just struck a mortal blow made her so afraid of him that she turned to run away But he caught her by the arm mister Headstone let me go mister Headstone I must call for help It is I who should call for help he said you don t know yet how much I need it The working of his face as she shrank from it glancing round for her brother and uncertain what to do might have extorted a cry from her in another instant but all at once he sternly stopped it and fixed it as if Death itself had done so There You see I have recovered myself Hear me out With much of the dignity of courage as she recalled her self reliant life and her right to be free from accountability to this man she released her arm from his grasp and stood looking full at him She had never been so handsome in his eyes A shade came over them while he looked back at her as if she drew the very light out of them to herself This time at least I will leave nothing unsaid he went on folding his hands before him clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any impetuous gesture this last time at least I will not be tortured with after thoughts of a lost opportunity mister Eugene Wrayburn Was it of him you spoke in your ungovernable rage and violence Lizzie Hexam demanded with spirit He bit his lip and looked at her and said never a word Was it mister Wrayburn that you threatened He bit his lip again and looked at her and said never a word You asked me to hear you out and you will not speak Let me find my brother Stay I threatened no one Her look dropped for an instant to his bleeding hand He lifted it to his mouth wiped it on his sleeve and again folded it over the other mister Eugene Wrayburn he repeated Why do you mention that name again and again mister Headstone Because it is the text of the little I have left to say Observe There are no threats in it If I utter a threat stop me and fasten it upon me mister Eugene Wrayburn A worse threat than was conveyed in his manner of uttering the name could hardly have escaped him He haunts you You accept favours from him You are willing enough to listen to HIM I know it as well as he does mister Wrayburn has been considerate and good to me sir said Lizzie proudly in connexion with the death and with the memory of my poor father No doubt He is of course a very considerate and a very good man mister Eugene Wrayburn He is nothing to you I think said Lizzie with an indignation she could not repress Oh yes he is There you mistake He is much to me What can he be to you He can be a rival to me among other things said Bradley mister Headstone returned Lizzie with a burning face it is cowardly in you to speak to me in this way But it makes me able to tell you that I do not like you and that I never have liked you from the first and that no other living creature has anything to do with the effect you have produced upon me for yourself His head bent for a moment as if under a weight and he then looked up again moistening his lips I was going on with the little I had left to say I knew all this about mister Eugene Wrayburn all the while you were drawing me to you I strove against the knowledge but quite in vain It made no difference in me With mister Eugene Wrayburn in my mind I went on With mister Eugene Wrayburn in my mind I spoke to you just now With mister Eugene Wrayburn in my mind I have been set aside and I have been cast out If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining it is it my fault mister Headstone said Lizzie compassionating the bitter struggle he could not conceal almost as much as she was repelled and alarmed by it I am not complaining he returned I am only stating the case I had to wrestle with my self respect when I submitted to be drawn to you in spite of mister Wrayburn You may imagine how low my self respect lies now She was hurt and angry but repressed herself in consideration of his suffering and of his being her brother s friend And it lies under his feet said Bradley unfolding his hands in spite of himself and fiercely motioning with them both towards the stones of the pavement Remember that It lies under that fellow s feet and he treads upon it and exults above it He does not said Lizzie He does said Bradley I have stood before him face to face and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt and walked over me Why Because he knew with triumph what was in store for me to night O mister Headstone you talk quite wildly Quite collectedly I know what I say too well Now I have said all I have used no threat remember I have done no more than show you how the case stands how the case stands so far At this moment her brother sauntered into view close by She darted to him and caught him by the hand Bradley followed and laid his heavy hand on the boy s opposite shoulder Charley Hexam I am going home I must walk home by myself to night and get shut up in my room without being spoken to Give me half an hour s start and let me be till you find me at my work in the morning I shall be at my work in the morning just as usual Clasping his hands he uttered a short unearthly broken cry and went his way The brother and sister were left looking at one another near a lamp in the solitary churchyard and the boy s face clouded and darkened as he said in a rough tone What is the meaning of this What have you done to my best friend Out with the truth Charley said his sister Speak a little more considerately I am not in the humour for consideration or for nonsense of any sort replied the boy What have you been doing Why has mister Headstone gone from us in that way He asked me you know he asked me to be his wife Charley Well said the boy impatiently And I was obliged to tell him that I could not be his wife You were obliged to tell him repeated the boy angrily between his teeth and rudely pushing her away You were obliged to tell him Do you know that he is worth fifty of you It may easily be so Charley but I cannot marry him You mean that you are conscious that you can t appreciate him and don t deserve him I suppose I mean that I do not like him Charley and that I will never marry him Upon my soul exclaimed the boy you are a nice picture of a sister Upon my soul you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world and to raise you with me are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims are they I will not reproach you Charley Hear her exclaimed the boy looking round at the darkness She won t reproach me She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own and she won t reproach me Why you ll tell me next that you won t reproach mister Headstone for coming out of the sphere to which he is an ornament and putting himself at YOUR feet to be rejected by YOU No Charley I will only tell you as I told himself that I thank him for doing so that I am sorry he did so and that I hope he will do much better and be happy Some touch of compunction smote the boy s hardening heart as he looked upon her his patient little nurse in infancy his patient friend adviser and reclaimer in boyhood the self forgetting sister who had done everything for him His tone relented and he drew her arm through his Now come Liz don t let us quarrel let us be reasonable and talk this over like brother and sister Will you listen to me Oh Charley she replied through her starting tears do I not listen to you and hear many hard things Then I am sorry There Liz I am unfeignedly sorry Only you do put me out so Now see mister Headstone is perfectly devoted to you He has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since I first brought him to see you Miss Peecher our schoolmistress pretty and young and all that is known to be very much attached to him and he won t so much as look at her or hear of her Now his devotion to you must be a disinterested one mustn t it If he married Miss Peecher he would be a great deal better off in all worldly respects than in marrying you Well then he has nothing to get by it has he Nothing Heaven knows Very well then said the boy that s something in his favour and a great thing Then I come in mister Headstone has always got me on and he has a good deal in his power and of course if he was my brother in law he wouldn t get me on less but would get me on more mister Headstone comes and confides in me in a very delicate way and says I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you Hexam and useful to you I say There s nothing in the world mister Headstone that I could be better pleased with mister Headstone says Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister Hexam And I say Certainly mister Headstone and naturally I have a good deal of influence with her So I have haven t I Liz Yes Charley Well said Now you see we begin to get on the moment we begin to be really talking it over like brother and sister Very well Then YOU come in As mister Headstone s wife you would be occupying a most respectable station and you would be holding a far better place in society than you hold now and you would at length get quit of the river side and the old disagreeables belonging to it and you would be rid for good of dolls dressmakers and their drunken fathers and the like of that Not that I want to disparage Miss Jenny Wren I dare say she is all very well in her way but her way is not your way as mister Headstone s wife Now you see Liz on all three accounts on mister Headstone s on mine on yours nothing could be better or more desirable They were walking slowly as the boy spoke and here he stood still to see what effect he had made His sister s eyes were fixed upon him but as they showed no yielding and as she remained silent he walked her on again There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed though he tried to conceal it Having so much influence with you Liz as I have perhaps I should have done better to have had a little chat with you in the first instance before mister Headstone spoke for himself But really all this in his favour seemed so plain and undeniable and I knew you to have always been so reasonable and sensible that I didn t consider it worth while Very likely that was a mistake of mine However it s soon set right All that need be done to set it right is for you to tell me at once that I may go home and tell mister Headstone that what has taken place is not final and that it will all come round by and by He stopped again The pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at him but she shook her head Can t you speak said the boy sharply I am very unwilling to speak Charley If I must I must I cannot authorize you to say any such thing to mister Headstone I cannot allow you to say any such thing to mister Headstone Nothing remains to be said to him from me after what I have said for good and all to night And this girl cried the boy contemptuously throwing her off again calls herself a sister Charley dear that is the second time that you have almost struck me Don t be hurt by my words I don t mean Heaven forbid that you intended it but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from me However said the boy taking no heed of the remonstrance and pursuing his own mortified disappointment I know what this means and you shall not disgrace me It means what I have told you Charley and nothing more That s not true said the boy in a violent tone and you know it s not It means your precious mister Wrayburn that s what it means Charley If you remember any old days of ours together forbear But you shall not disgrace me doggedly pursued the boy I am determined that after I have climbed up out of the mire you shall not pull me down You can t disgrace me if I have nothing to do with you and I will have nothing to do with you for the future Charley On many a night like this and many a worse night I have sat on the stones of the street hushing you in my arms Unsay those words without even saying you are sorry for them and my arms are open to you still and so is my heart I ll not unsay them I ll say them again You are an inveterately bad girl and a false sister and I have done with you For ever I have done with you He threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier between them and flung himself upon his heel and left her She remained impassive on the same spot silent and motionless until the striking of the church clock roused her and she turned away But then with the breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that the cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen And O that I were lying here with the dead and O Charley Charley that this should be the end of our pictures in the fire were all the words she said as she laid her face in her hands on the stone coping A figure passed by and passed on but stopped and looked round at her It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head wearing a large brimmed low crowned hat and a long skirted coat After hesitating a little the figure turned back and advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion said Pardon me young woman for speaking to you but you are under some distress of mind I cannot pass upon my way and leave you weeping here alone as if there was nothing in the place Can I help you Can I do anything to give you comfort She raised her head at the sound of these kind words and answered gladly O mister Riah is it you My daughter said the old man I stand amazed I spoke as to a stranger Take my arm take my arm What grieves you Who has done this Poor girl poor girl My brother has quarrelled with me sobbed Lizzie and renounced me He is a thankless dog said the Jew angrily Let him go Shake the dust from thy feet and let him go Come daughter Come home with me it is but across the road and take a little time to recover your peace and to make your eyes seemly and then I will bear you company through the streets For it is past your usual time and will soon be late and the way is long and there is much company out of doors to night She accepted the support he offered her and they slowly passed out of the churchyard They were in the act of emerging into the main thoroughfare when another figure loitering discontentedly by and looking up the street and down it and all about started and exclaimed Lizzie why where have you been Why what s the matter As Eugene Wrayburn thus addressed her she drew closer to the Jew and bent her head The Jew having taken in the whole of Eugene at one sharp glance cast his eyes upon the ground and stood mute Lizzie what is the matter mister Wrayburn I cannot tell you now I cannot tell you to night if I ever can tell you Pray leave me But Lizzie I came expressly to join you I came to walk home with you having dined at a coffee house in this neighbourhood and knowing your hour And I have been lingering about added Eugene like a bailiff or with a look at Riah an old clothesman The Jew lifted up his eyes and took in Eugene once more at another glance mister Wrayburn pray pray leave me with this protector And one thing more Pray pray be careful of yourself Mysteries of Udolpho said Eugene with a look of wonder May I be excused for asking in the elderly gentleman s presence who is this kind protector A trustworthy friend said Lizzie I will relieve him of his trust returned Eugene But you must tell me Lizzie what is the matter Her brother is the matter said the old man lifting up his eyes again Our brother the matter returned Eugene with airy contempt Our brother is not worth a thought far less a tear What has our brother done The old man lifted up his eyes again with one grave look at Wrayburn and one grave glance at Lizzie as she stood looking down Both were so full of meaning that even Eugene was checked in his light career and subsided into a thoughtful Humph With an air of perfect patience the old man remaining mute and keeping his eyes cast down stood retaining Lizzie s arm as though in his habit of passive endurance it would be all one to him if he had stood there motionless all night If mister Aaron said Eugene who soon found this fatiguing will be good enough to relinquish his charge to me he will be quite free for any engagement he may have at the Synagogue mister Aaron will you have the kindness But the old man stood stock still Good evening mister Aaron said Eugene politely we need not detain you Then turning to Lizzie Is our friend mister Aaron a little deaf My hearing is very good Christian gentleman replied the old man calmly but I will hear only one voice to night desiring me to leave this damsel before I have conveyed her to her home If she requests it I will do it I will do it for no one else May I ask why so mister Aaron said Eugene quite undisturbed in his ease Excuse me If she asks me I will tell her replied the old man I will tell no one else I do not ask you said Lizzie and I beg you to take me home mister Wrayburn I have had a bitter trial to night and I hope you will not think me ungrateful or mysterious or changeable I am neither I am wretched Pray remember what I said to you Pray pray take care My dear Lizzie he returned in a low voice bending over her on the other side of what Of whom Of any one you have lately seen and made angry He snapped his fingers and laughed Come said he since no better may be mister Aaron and I will divide this trust and see you home together mister Aaron on that side I on this If perfectly agreeable to mister Aaron the escort will now proceed He knew his power over her He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her He knew that her fears for him being aroused she would be uneasy if he were out of her sight For all his seeming levity and carelessness he knew whatever he chose to know of the thoughts of her heart And going on at her side so gaily regardless of all that had been urged against him so superior in his sallies and self possession to the gloomy constraint of her suitor and the selfish petulance of her brother so faithful to her as it seemed when her own stock was faithless what an immense advantage what an overpowering influence were his that night Add to the rest poor girl that she had heard him vilified for her sake and that she had suffered for his and where the wonder that his occasional tones of serious interest setting off his carelessness as if it were assumed to calm her that his lightest touch his lightest look his very presence beside her in the dark common street were like glimpses of an enchanted world which it was natural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear the brightness of and to gird at as bad spirits might Nothing more being said of repairing to Riah s they went direct to Lizzie s lodging A little short of the house door she parted from them and went in alone mister Aaron said Eugene when they were left together in the street with many thanks for your company it remains for me unwillingly to say Farewell Sir returned the other I give you good night and I wish that you were not so thoughtless mister Aaron returned Eugene I give you good night and I wish for you are a little dull that you were not so thoughtful But now that his part was played out for the evening and when in turning his back upon the Jew he came off the stage he was thoughtful himself How did Lightwood s catechism run he murmured as he stopped to light his cigar What is to come of it What are you doing Where are you going We shall soon know now Ah with a heavy sigh The heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo an hour afterwards when Riah who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against the house arose and went his patient way stealing through the streets in his ancient dress like the ghost of a departed Time Chapter sixteen AN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION The estimable Twemlow dressing himself in his lodgings over the stable yard in Duke Street Saint James s and hearing the horses at their toilette below finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous position as compared with the noble animals at livery For whereas on the one hand he has no attendant to slap him soundingly and require him in gruff accents to come up and come over still on the other hand he has no attendant at all and the mild gentleman s finger joints and other joints working rustily in the morning he could deem it agreeable even to be tied up by the countenance at his chamber door so he were there skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and clothed while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying transactions How the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men is known only to the Graces and her maid but perhaps even that engaging creature though not reduced to the self dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is as it were a diurnal species of lobster throwing off a shell every forenoon and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens Howbeit Twemlow doth at length invest himself with collar and cravat and wristbands to his knuckles and goeth forth to breakfast And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours the Lammles of Sackville Street who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman mister Fledgely The awful Snigsworth might taboo and prohibit Fledgely but the peaceable Twemlow reasons If he IS my kinsman I didn t make him so and to meet a man is not to know him It is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of mister and missus Lammle and the celebration is a breakfast because a dinner on the desired scale of sumptuosity cannot be achieved within less limits than those of the non existent palatial residence of which so many people are madly envious So Twemlow trips with not a little stiffness across Piccadilly sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less in danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles To be sure that was in the days when he hoped for leave from the dread Snigsworth to do something or be something in life and before that magnificent Tartar issued the ukase As he will never distinguish himself he must be a poor gentleman pensioner of mine and let him hereby consider himself pensioned Ah my Twemlow Say little feeble grey personage what thoughts are in thy breast to day of the Fancy so still to call her who bruised thy heart when it was green and thy head brown and whether it be better or worse more painful or less to believe in the Fancy to this hour than to know her for a greedy armour plated crocodile with no more capacity of imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy waistcoat than of going straight at it with a knitting needle Say likewise my Twemlow whether it be the happier lot to be a poor relation of the great or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach stand into which thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot Twemlow says nothing and goes on As he approaches the Lammles door drives up a little one horse carriage containing Tippins the divine Tippins letting down the window playfully extols the vigilance of her cavalier in being in waiting there to hand her out Twemlow hands her out with as much polite gravity as if she were anything real and they proceed upstairs Tippins all abroad about the legs and seeking to express that those unsteady articles are only skipping in their native buoyancy And dear missus Lammle and dear mister Lammle how do you do and when are you going down to what s its name place Guy Earl of Warwick you know what is it Dun Cow to claim the flitch of bacon And Mortimer whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion how do YOU do wretch And mister Wrayburn YOU here What can YOU come for because we are all very sure before hand that you are not going to talk And Veneering M P how are things going on down at the house and when will you turn out those terrible people for us And missus Veneering my dear can it positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after night to hear those men prose Talking of which Veneering why don t you prose for you haven t opened your lips there yet and we are dying to hear what you have got to say to us Miss Podsnap charmed to see you Pa here No Ma neither Oh mister Boots Delighted mister Brewer This IS a gathering of the clans Thus Tippins and surveys Fledgeby and outsiders through golden glass murmuring as she turns about and about in her innocent giddy way Anybody else I know No I think not Nobody there Nobody THERE Nobody anywhere mister Lammle all a glitter produces his friend Fledgeby as dying for the honour of presentation to Lady Tippins Fledgeby presented has the air of going to say something has the air of going to say nothing has an air successively of meditation of resignation and of desolation backs on Brewer makes the tour of Boots and fades into the extreme background feeling for his whisker as if it might have turned up since he was there five minutes ago But Lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land He would seem to be in a bad way Fledgeby for Lammle represents him as dying again He is dying now of want of presentation to Twemlow Twemlow offers his hand Glad to see him Your mother sir was a connexion of mine I believe so says Fledgeby but my mother and her family were two Are you staying in town asks Twemlow I always am says Fledgeby You like town says Twemlow But is felled flat by Fledgeby s taking it quite ill and replying No he don t like town Lammle tries to break the force of the fall by remarking that some people do not like town Fledgeby retorting that he never heard of any such case but his own Twemlow goes down again heavily There is nothing new this morning I suppose says Twemlow returning to the mark with great spirit Fledgeby has not heard of anything No there s not a word of news says Lammle Not a particle adds Boots Not an atom chimes in Brewer Somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise the general spirits as with a sense of duty done and sets the company a going Everybody seems more equal than before to the calamity of being in the society of everybody else Even Eugene standing in a window moodily swinging the tassel of a blind gives it a smarter jerk now as if he found himself in better case Breakfast announced Everything on table showy and gaudy but with a self assertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations as boasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence mister Lammle s own particular servant behind his chair the Analytical behind Veneering s chair instances in point that such servants fall into two classes one mistrusting the master s acquaintances and the other mistrusting the master mister Lammle s servant of the second class Appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up on some charge of the first magnitude Veneering M P on the right of missus Lammle Twemlow on her left missus Veneering W M P wife of Member of Parliament and Lady Tippins on mister Lammle s right and left But be sure that well within the fascination of mister Lammle s eye and smile sits little Georgiana And be sure that close to little Georgiana also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman sits Fledgeby Oftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress mister Twemlow gives a little sudden turn towards missus Lammle and then says to her I beg your pardon This not being Twemlow s usual way why is it his way to day Why the truth is Twemlow repeatedly labours under the impression that missus Lammle is going to speak to him and turning finds that it is not so and mostly that she has her eyes upon Veneering Strange that this impression so abides by Twemlow after being corrected yet so it is Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth including grape juice in the category becomes livelier and applies herself to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood It is always understood among the initiated that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to Lady Tippins who will then strike conversational fire out of him In a pause of mastication and deglutition Lady Tippins contemplating Mortimer recalls that it was at our dear Veneerings and in the presence of a party who are surely all here that he told them his story of the man from somewhere which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular Yes Lady Tippins assents Mortimer as they say on the stage Even so Then we expect you retorts the charmer to sustain your reputation and tell us something else Lady Tippins I exhausted myself for life that day and there is nothing more to be got out of me Mortimer parries thus with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is Eugene and not he who is the jester and that in these circles where Eugene persists in being speechless he Mortimer is but the double of the friend on whom he has founded himself But quoth the fascinating Tippins I am resolved on getting something more out of you Traitor what is this I hear about another disappearance As it is you who have heard it returns Lightwood perhaps you ll tell us Monster away retorts Lady Tippins Your own Golden Dustman referred me to you mister Lammle striking in here proclaims aloud that there is a sequel to the story of the man from somewhere Silence ensues upon the proclamation I assure you says Lightwood glancing round the table I have nothing to tell But Eugene adding in a low voice There tell it tell it he corrects himself with the addition Nothing worth mentioning Boots and Brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth mentioning and become politely clamorous Veneering is also visited by a perception to the same effect But it is understood that his attention is now rather used up and difficult to hold that being the tone of the House of Commons Pray don t be at the trouble of composing yourselves to listen says Mortimer Lightwood because I shall have finished long before you have fallen into comfortable attitudes It s like It s like impatiently interrupts Eugene the children s narrative I ll tell you a story Of Jack a Manory And now my story s begun I ll tell you another Of Jack and his brother And now my story is done Get on and get it over Eugene says this with a sound of vexation in his voice leaning back in his chair and looking balefully at Lady Tippins who nods to him as her dear Bear and playfully insinuates that she a self evident proposition is Beauty and he Beast The reference proceeds Mortimer which I suppose to be made by my honourable and fair enslaver opposite is to the following circumstance Very lately the young woman Lizzie Hexam daughter of the late Jesse Hexam otherwise Gaffer who will be remembered to have found the body of the man from somewhere mysteriously received she knew not from whom an explicit retraction of the charges made against her father by another water side character of the name of Riderhood Nobody believed them because little Rogue Riderhood I am tempted into the paraphrase by remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great service if he had devoured mister Riderhood s father and mother in their infancy had previously played fast and loose with the said charges and in fact abandoned them However the retraction I have mentioned found its way into Lizzie Hexam s hands with a general flavour on it of having been favoured by some anonymous messenger in a dark cloak and slouched hat and was by her forwarded in her father s vindication to mister Boffin my client You will excuse the phraseology of the shop but as I never had another client and in all likelihood never shall have I am rather proud of him as a natural curiosity probably unique Although as easy as usual on the surface Lightwood is not quite as easy as usual below it With an air of not minding Eugene at all he feels that the subject is not altogether a safe one in that connexion The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum he resumes hereupon desires his Secretary an individual of the hermit crab or oyster species and whose name I think is Chokesmith but it doesn t in the least matter say Artichoke to put himself in communication with Lizzie Hexam Artichoke professes his readiness so to do endeavours to do so but fails Why fails asks Boots How fails asks Brewer Pardon me returns Lightwood I must postpone the reply for one moment or we shall have an anti climax Artichoke failing signally my client refers the task to me his purpose being to advance the interests of the object of his search I proceed to put myself in communication with her I even happen to possess some special means with a glance at Eugene of putting myself in communication with her but I fail too because she has vanished Vanished is the general echo Disappeared says Mortimer Nobody knows how nobody knows when nobody knows where And so ends the story to which my honourable and fair enslaver opposite referred Tippins with a bewitching little scream opines that we shall every one of us be murdered in our beds Eugene eyes her as if some of us would be enough for him missus Veneering W M P remarks that these social mysteries make one afraid of leaving Baby Veneering M P wishes to be informed with something of a second hand air of seeing the Right Honourable Gentleman at the head of the Home Department in his place whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed Instead of Lightwood s answering Eugene answers and answers hastily and vexedly No no no he doesn t mean that he means voluntarily vanished but utterly completely However the great subject of the happiness of mister and missus Lammle must not be allowed to vanish with the other vanishments with the vanishing of the murderer the vanishing of Julius Handford the vanishing of Lizzie Hexam and therefore Veneering must recall the present sheep to the pen from which they have strayed Who so fit to discourse of the happiness of mister and missus Lammle they being the dearest and oldest friends he has in the world or what audience so fit for him to take into his confidence as that audience a noun of multitude or signifying many who are all the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world So Veneering without the formality of rising launches into a familiar oration gradually toning into the Parliamentary sing song in which he sees at that board his dear friend Twemlow who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on his dear friend Lammle the fair hand of his dear friend Sophronia and in which he also sees at that board his dear friends Boots and Brewer whose rallying round him at a period when his dear friend Lady Tippins likewise rallied round him ay and in the foremost rank he can never forget while memory holds her seat But he is free to confess that he misses from that board his dear old friend Podsnap though he is well represented by his dear young friend Georgiana And he further sees at that board this he announces with pomp as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope his friend mister Fledgeby if he will permit him to call him so For all of these reasons and many more which he right well knows will have occurred to persons of your exceptional acuteness he is here to submit to you that the time has arrived when with our hearts in our glasses with tears in our eyes with blessings on our lips and in a general way with a profusion of gammon and spinach in our emotional larders we should one and all drink to our dear friends the Lammles wishing them many years as happy as the last and many many friends as congenially united as themselves And this he will add that Anastatia Veneering who is instantly heard to weep is formed on the same model as her old and chosen friend Sophronia Lammle in respect that she is devoted to the man who wooed and won her and nobly discharges the duties of a wife Seeing no better way out of it Veneering here pulls up his oratorical Pegasus extremely short and plumps down clean over his head with Lammle God bless you Then Lammle Too much of him every way pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape and his nose in his mind and his manners too much smile to be real too much frown to be false too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite He thanks you dear friends for your kindly greeting and hopes to receive you it may be on the next of these delightful occasions in a residence better suited to your claims on the rites of hospitality He will never forget that at Veneering s he first saw Sophronia Sophronia will never forget that at Veneering s she first saw him They spoke of it soon after they were married and agreed that they would never forget it In fact to Veneering they owe their union They hope to show their sense of this some day No no from Veneering oh yes yes and let him rely upon it they will if they can His marriage with Sophronia was not a marriage of interest on either side she had her little fortune he had his little fortune they joined their little fortunes it was a marriage of pure inclination and suitability Thank you Sophronia and he are fond of the society of young people but he is not sure that their house would be a good house for young people proposing to remain single since the contemplation of its domestic bliss might induce them to change their minds He will not apply this to any one present certainly not to their darling little Georgiana Again thank you Neither by the by will he apply it to his friend Fledgeby He thanks Veneering for the feeling manner in which he referred to their common friend Fledgeby for he holds that gentleman in the highest estimation Thank you In fact returning unexpectedly to Fledgeby the better you know him the more you find in him that you desire to know Again thank you In his dear Sophronia s name and in his own thank you missus Lammle has sat quite still with her eyes cast down upon the table cloth As mister Lammle s address ends Twemlow once more turns to her involuntarily not cured yet of that often recurring impression that she is going to speak to him This time she really is going to speak to him Veneering is talking with his other next neighbour and she speaks in a low voice mister Twemlow He answers I beg your pardon Yes Still a little doubtful because of her not looking at him You have the soul of a gentleman and I know I may trust you Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs Assuredly I shall be honoured Don t seem to do so if you please and don t think it inconsistent if my manner should be more careless than my words I may be watched Intensely astonished Twemlow puts his hand to his forehead and sinks back in his chair meditating missus Lammle rises All rise The ladies go up stairs The gentlemen soon saunter after them Fledgeby has devoted the interval to taking an observation of Boots s whiskers Brewer s whiskers and Lammle s whiskers and considering which pattern of whisker he would prefer to produce out of himself by friction if the Genie of the cheek would only answer to his rubbing In the drawing room groups form as usual Lightwood Boots and Brewer flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle guttering down and with some hint of a winding sheet in it Lady Tippins Outsiders cultivate Veneering M P and missus Veneering W M P Lammle stands with folded arms Mephistophelean in a corner with Georgiana and Fledgeby missus Lammle on a sofa by a table invites mister Twemlow s attention to a book of portraits in her hand mister Twemlow takes his station on a settee before her and missus Lammle shows him a portrait You have reason to be surprised she says softly but I wish you wouldn t look so Disturbed Twemlow making an effort not to look so looks much more so I think mister Twemlow you never saw that distant connexion of yours before to day No never Now that you do see him you see what he is You are not proud of him To say the truth missus Lammle no If you knew more of him you would be less inclined to acknowledge him Here is another portrait What do you think of it Twemlow has just presence of mind enough to say aloud Very like Uncommonly like You have noticed perhaps whom he favours with his attentions You notice where he is now and how engaged Yes But mister Lammle She darts a look at him which he cannot comprehend and shows him another portrait Very good is it not Charming says Twemlow So like as to be almost a caricature mister Twemlow it is impossible to tell you what the struggle in my mind has been before I could bring myself to speak to you as I do now It is only in the conviction that I may trust you never to betray me that I can proceed Sincerely promise me that you never will betray my confidence that you will respect it even though you may no longer respect me and I shall be as satisfied as if you had sworn it Madam on the honour of a poor gentleman Thank you I can desire no more mister Twemlow I implore you to save that child That child Georgiana She will be sacrificed She will be inveigled and married to that connexion of yours It is a partnership affair a money speculation She has no strength of will or character to help herself and she is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for life Amazing But what can I do to prevent it demands Twemlow shocked and bewildered to the last degree Here is another portrait And not good is it Aghast at the light manner of her throwing her head back to look at it critically Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing his own head back and does so Though he no more sees the portrait than if it were in China Decidedly not good says missus Lammle Stiff and exaggerated And ex But Twemlow in his demolished state cannot command the word and trails off into actly so mister Twemlow your word will have weight with her pompous self blinded father You know how much he makes of your family Lose no time Warn him But warn him against whom Against me By great good fortune Twemlow receives a stimulant at this critical instant The stimulant is Lammle s voice Sophronia my dear what portraits are you showing Twemlow Public characters Alfred Show him the last of me Yes Alfred She puts the book down takes another book up turns the leaves and presents the portrait to Twemlow That is the last of mister Lammle Do you think it good Warn her father against me I deserve it for I have been in the scheme from the first It is my husband s scheme your connexion s and mine I tell you this only to show you the necessity of the poor little foolish affectionate creature s being befriended and rescued You will not repeat this to her father You will spare me so far and spare my husband For though this celebration of to day is all a mockery he is my husband and we must live Do you think it like Twemlow in a stunned condition feigns to compare the portrait in his hand with the original looking towards him from his Mephistophelean corner Very well indeed are at length the words which Twemlow with great difficulty extracts from himself I am glad you think so On the whole I myself consider it the best The others are so dark Now here for instance is another of mister Lammle But I don t understand I don t see my way Twemlow stammers as he falters over the book with his glass at his eye How warn her father and not tell him Tell him how much Tell him how little I I am getting lost Tell him I am a match maker tell him I am an artful and designing woman tell him you are sure his daughter is best out of my house and my company Tell him any such things of me they will all be true You know what a puffed up man he is and how easily you can cause his vanity to take the alarm Tell him as much as will give him the alarm and make him careful of her and spare me the rest mister Twemlow I feel my sudden degradation in your eyes familiar as I am with my degradation in my own eyes I keenly feel the change that must have come upon me in yours in these last few moments But I trust to your good faith with me as implicitly as when I began If you knew how often I have tried to speak to you to day you would almost pity me I want no new promise from you on my own account for I am satisfied and I always shall be satisfied with the promise you have given me I can venture to say no more for I see that I am watched If you would set my mind at rest with the assurance that you will interpose with the father and save this harmless girl close that book before you return it to me and I shall know what you mean and deeply thank you in my heart Alfred mister Twemlow thinks the last one the best and quite agrees with you and me Alfred advances The groups break up Lady Tippins rises to go and missus Veneering follows her leader For the moment missus Lammle does not turn to them but remains looking at Twemlow looking at Alfred s portrait through his eyeglass The moment past Twemlow drops his eyeglass at its ribbon s length rises and closes the book with an emphasis which makes that fragile nursling of the fairies Tippins start Then good bye and good bye and charming occasion worthy of the Golden Age and more about the flitch of bacon and the like of that and Twemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart and at last drops safe in his easy chair innocent good gentleman with his hand to his forehead still and his head in a whirl BOOK THE THIRD A LONG LANE Chapter one LODGERS IN QUEER STREET It was a foggy day in London and the fog was heavy and dark Animate London with smarting eyes and irritated lungs was blinking wheezing and choking inanimate London was a sooty spectre divided in purpose between being visible and invisible and so being wholly neither Gaslights flared in the shops with a haggard and unblest air as knowing themselves to be night creatures that had no business abroad under the sun while the sun itself when it was for a few moments dimly indicated through circling eddies of fog showed as if it had gone out and were collapsing flat and cold 
1027_125147_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day but there the fog was grey whereas in London it was at about the boundary line dark yellow and a little within it brown and then browner and then browner until at the heart of the City which call Saint Mary Axe it was rusty black 
none	none	From any point of the high ridge of land northward it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea and especially that the great dome of Saint Paul s seemed to die hard but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet where the whole metropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels and enfolding a gigantic catarrh At nine o clock on such a morning the place of business of Pubsey and company was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe which is not a very lively spot with a sobbing gaslight in the counting house window and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the keyhole of the main door 
1027_125147_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But the light went out and the main door opened and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm 
none	none	Almost in the act of coming out at the door Riah went into the fog and was lost to the eyes of Saint Mary Axe 
1027_125147_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But the eyes of this history can follow him westward by Cornhill Cheapside Fleet Street and the Strand to Piccadilly and the Albany 
none	none	Thither he went at his grave and measured pace staff in hand skirt at heel and more than one head turning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist supposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen which fancy and the fog had worked into that passing likeness 
1027_125147_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Arrived at the house in which his master s chambers were on the second floor Riah proceeded up the stairs and paused at Fascination Fledgeby s door 
1027_125147_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Making free with neither bell nor knocker he struck upon the door with the top of his staff and having listened sat down on the threshold 
1027_125147_000007_000002	train-clean-360	It was characteristic of his habitual submission that he sat down on the raw dark staircase as many of his ancestors had probably sat down in dungeons taking what befell him as it might befall 
1027_125147_000008_000000	train-clean-360	After a time when he had grown so cold as to be fain to blow upon his fingers he arose and knocked with his staff again and listened again and again sat down to wait 
1027_125147_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Thrice he repeated these actions before his listening ears were greeted by the voice of Fledgeby calling from his bed Hold your row I ll come and open the door directly But in lieu of coming directly he fell into a sweet sleep for some quarter of an hour more during which added interval Riah sat upon the stairs and waited with perfect patience 
1027_125147_000009_000000	train-clean-360	At length the door stood open and mister Fledgeby s retreating drapery plunged into bed again 
1027_125147_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Following it at a respectful distance Riah passed into the bed chamber where a fire had been sometime lighted and was burning briskly 
1027_125147_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Why what time of night do you mean to call it inquired Fledgeby turning away beneath the clothes and presenting a comfortable rampart of shoulder to the chilled figure of the old man 
none	none	Sir it is full half past ten in the morning The deuce it is 
1027_125147_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Then it must be precious foggy 
1027_125147_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Very foggy sir 
none	none	And raw then Chill and bitter said Riah drawing out a handkerchief and wiping the moisture from his beard and long grey hair as he stood on the verge of the rug with his eyes on the acceptable fire 
1027_125147_000016_000000	train-clean-360	With a plunge of enjoyment Fledgeby settled himself afresh 
1027_125147_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Any snow or sleet or slush or anything of that sort he asked 
1027_125147_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No sir no Not quite so bad as that 
1027_125147_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The streets are pretty clean 
none	none	You needn t brag about it returned Fledgeby disappointed in his desire to heighten the contrast between his bed and the streets
1027_125147_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 But you re always bragging about something 
1027_125147_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Got the books there 
none	none	They are here sir All right I ll turn the general subject over in my mind for a minute or two and while I m about it you can empty your bag and get ready for me 
1027_125147_000022_000000	train-clean-360	With another comfortable plunge mister Fledgeby fell asleep again 
none	none	The old man having obeyed his directions sat down on the edge of a chair and folding his hands before him gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth and dozed 
1027_125147_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He was roused by mister Fledgeby s appearing erect at the foot of the bed in Turkish slippers rose coloured Turkish trousers got cheap from somebody who had cheated some other somebody out of them and a gown and cap to correspond 
1027_125147_000022_000003	train-clean-360	In that costume he would have left nothing to be desired if he had been further fitted out with a bottomless chair a lantern and a bunch of matches 
none	none	Now old un cried Fascination in his light raillery what dodgery are you up to next sitting there with your eyes shut 
1027_125147_000023_000001	train-clean-360	You ain t asleep Catch a weasel at it and catch a Jew 
none	none	Truly sir I fear I nodded said the old man
1027_125147_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Not you returned Fledgeby with a cunning look 
none	none	A telling move with a good many I dare say but it won t put ME off my guard Not a bad notion though if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain Oh you are a dodger 
1027_125147_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The old man shook his head gently repudiating the imputation and suppressed a sigh and moved to the table at which mister Fledgeby was now pouring out for himself a cup of steaming and fragrant coffee from a pot that had stood ready on the hob 
1027_125147_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It was an edifying spectacle the young man in his easy chair taking his coffee and the old man with his grey head bent standing awaiting his pleasure 
1027_125147_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said Fledgeby Fork out your balance in hand and prove by figures how you make it out that it ain t more 
1027_125147_000027_000001	train-clean-360	First of all light that candle 
1027_125147_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Riah obeyed and then taking a bag from his breast and referring to the sum in the accounts for which they made him responsible told it out upon the table 
1027_125147_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Fledgeby told it again with great care and rang every sovereign 
none	none	I suppose he said taking one up to eye it closely you haven t been lightening any of these but it s a trade of your people s you know YOU understand what sweating a pound means don t you Much as you do sir returned the old man with his hands under opposite cuffs of his loose sleeves as he stood at the table deferentially observant of the master s face
1027_125147_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 May I take the liberty to say something 
1027_125147_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 You may Fledgeby graciously conceded 
1027_125147_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you not sir without intending it of a surety without intending it sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment with the character which it is your policy that I should bear 
1027_125147_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the inquiry Fascination coolly answered 
1027_125147_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Not in justice 
1027_125147_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Bother justice said Fledgeby 
1027_125147_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Not in generosity 
none	none	Jews and generosity said Fledgeby
1027_125147_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 That s a good connexion 
1027_125147_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Bring out your vouchers and don t talk Jerusalem palaver 
1027_125147_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The vouchers were produced and for the next half hour mister Fledgeby concentrated his sublime attention on them 
none	none	They and the accounts were all found correct and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag
1027_125147_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Next said Fledgeby concerning that bill broking branch of the business the branch I like best 
1027_125147_000039_000001	train-clean-360	What queer bills are to be bought and at what prices 
1027_125147_000039_000002	train-clean-360	You have got your list of what s in the market 
1027_125147_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir a long list replied Riah taking out a pocket book and selecting from its contents a folded paper which being unfolded became a sheet of foolscap covered with close writing 
none	none	Whew whistled Fledgeby as he took it in his hand
1027_125147_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Queer Street is full of lodgers just at present 
1027_125147_000041_000002	train-clean-360	These are to be disposed of in parcels are they 
1027_125147_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 In parcels as set forth returned the old man looking over his master s shoulder or the lump 
1027_125147_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Half the lump will be waste paper one knows beforehand said Fledgeby Can you get it at waste paper price 
1027_125147_000043_000001	train-clean-360	That s the question 
1027_125147_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Riah shook his head and Fledgeby cast his small eyes down the list They presently began to twinkle and he no sooner became conscious of their twinkling than he looked up over his shoulder at the grave face above him and moved to the chimney piece 
1027_125147_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Making a desk of it he stood there with his back to the old man warming his knees perusing the list at his leisure and often returning to some lines of it as though they were particularly interesting 
none	none	At those times he glanced in the chimney glass to see what note the old man took of him 
1027_125147_000044_000003	train-clean-360	He took none that could be detected but aware of his employer s suspicions stood with his eyes on the ground 
1027_125147_000045_000000	train-clean-360	mister Fledgeby was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door and the door was heard to open hastily 
none	none	Hark 
1027_125147_000045_000002	train-clean-360	That s your doing you Pump of Israel said Fledgeby you can t have shut it Then the step was heard within and the voice of mister Alfred Lammle called aloud Are you anywhere here Fledgeby To which Fledgeby after cautioning Riah in a low voice to take his cue as it should be given him replied Here I am and opened his bedroom door 
1027_125147_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Come in said Fledgeby 
none	none	This gentleman is only Pubsey and company of Saint Mary Axe that I am trying to make terms for an unfortunate friend with in a matter of some dishonoured bills But really Pubsey and company are so strict with their debtors and so hard to move that I seem to be wasting my time 
1027_125147_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Can t I make ANY terms with you on my friend s part mister Riah 
1027_125147_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I am but the representative of another sir returned the Jew in a low voice 
1027_125147_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I do as I am bidden by my principal 
none	none	It is not my capital that is invested in the business 
1027_125147_000047_000003	train-clean-360	It is not my profit that arises therefrom 
1027_125147_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha ha laughed Fledgeby 
none	none	Lammle
1027_125147_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha ha laughed Lammle Yes 
none	none	Of course We know
1027_125147_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Devilish good ain t it Lammle said Fledgeby unspeakably amused by his hidden joke 
none	none	Always the same always the same said Lammle mister Riah Pubsey and company Saint Mary Axe Fledgeby put in as he wiped away the tears that trickled from his eyes so rare was his enjoyment of his secret joke mister Riah is bound to observe the invariable forms for such cases made and provided said Lammle
1027_125147_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 He is only the representative of another cried Fledgeby Does as he is told by his principal 
none	none	Not his capital that s invested in the business Oh that s good Ha ha ha ha mister Lammle joined in the laugh and looked knowing and the more he did both the more exquisite the secret joke became for mister Fledgeby However said that fascinating gentleman wiping his eyes again if we go on in this way we shall seem to be almost making game of mister Riah or of Pubsey and company 
1027_125147_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Saint Mary Axe or of somebody which is far from our intention 
none	none	mister Riah if you would have the kindness to step into the next room for a few moments while I speak with mister Lammle here I should like to try to make terms with you once again before you go The old man who had never raised his eyes during the whole transaction of mister Fledgeby s joke silently bowed and passed out by the door which Fledgeby opened for him 
1027_125147_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Having closed it on him Fledgeby returned to Lammle standing with his back to the bedroom fire with one hand under his coat skirts and all his whiskers in the other 
none	none	Halloa said Fledgeby There s something wrong
1027_125147_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you know it demanded Lammle 
1027_125147_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Because you show it replied Fledgeby in unintentional rhyme 
1027_125147_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then there is said Lammle there IS something wrong the whole thing s wrong 
none	none	I say remonstrated Fascination very slowly and sitting down with his hands on his knees to stare at his glowering friend with his back to the fire
1027_125147_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I tell you Fledgeby repeated Lammle with a sweep of his right arm the whole thing s wrong 
none	none	The game s up
1027_125147_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 What game s up demanded Fledgeby as slowly as before and more sternly 
none	none	THE game 
1027_125147_000064_000001	train-clean-360	OUR game 
none	none	Read that 
1027_125147_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Fledgeby took a note from his extended hand and read it aloud 
none	none	Alfred Lammle Esquire 
1027_125147_000065_000002	train-clean-360	Sir Allow missus Podsnap and myself to express our united sense of the polite attentions of missus Alfred Lammle and yourself towards our daughter Georgiana 
none	none	Allow us also wholly to reject them for the future and to communicate our final desire that the two families may become entire strangers I have the honour to be Sir your most obedient and very humble servant JOHN PODSNAP Fledgeby looked at the three blank sides of this note quite as long and earnestly as at the first expressive side and then looked at Lammle who responded with another extensive sweep of his right arm Whose doing is this said Fledgeby Impossible to imagine said Lammle
1027_125147_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps suggested Fledgeby after reflecting with a very discontented brow somebody has been giving you a bad character 
none	none	Or you said Lammle with a deeper frown mister Fledgeby appeared to be on the verge of some mutinous expressions when his hand happened to touch his nose 
1027_125147_000070_000001	train-clean-360	A certain remembrance connected with that feature operating as a timely warning he took it thoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger and pondered Lammle meanwhile eyeing him with furtive eyes 
1027_125147_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Fledgeby This won t improve with talking about 
none	none	If we ever find out who did it we ll mark that person There s nothing more to be said except that you undertook to do what circumstances prevent your doing And that you undertook to do what you might have done by this time if you had made a prompter use of circumstances snarled Lammle Hah That remarked Fledgeby with his hands in the Turkish trousers is matter of opinion mister Fledgeby said Lammle in a bullying tone am I to understand that you in any way reflect upon me or hint dissatisfaction with me in this affair
1027_125147_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Fledgeby 
1027_125147_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Fledgeby provided you have brought my promissory note in your pocket and now hand it over 
1027_125147_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Lammle produced it not without reluctance 
1027_125147_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Fledgeby looked at it identified it twisted it up and threw it into the fire 
1027_125147_000076_000002	train-clean-360	They both looked at it as it blazed went out and flew in feathery ash up the chimney 
none	none	NOW mister Fledgeby said Lammle as before am I to understand that you in any way reflect upon me or hint dissatisfaction with me in this affair No said Fledgeby Finally and unreservedly no Yes
1027_125147_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Fledgeby my hand 
1027_125147_000082_000000	train-clean-360	mister Fledgeby took it saying And if we ever find out who did this we ll mark that person 
1027_125147_000082_000001	train-clean-360	And in the most friendly manner let me mention one thing more 
1027_125147_000082_000002	train-clean-360	I don t know what your circumstances are and I don t ask 
1027_125147_000082_000003	train-clean-360	You have sustained a loss here 
none	none	Many men are liable to be involved at times and you may be or you may not be But whatever you do Lammle don t don t don t I beg of you ever fall into the hands of Pubsey and company in the next room for they are grinders Regular flayers and grinders my dear Lammle repeated Fledgeby with a peculiar relish and they ll skin you by the inch from the nape of your neck to the sole of your foot and grind every inch of your skin to tooth powder You have seen what mister Riah is 
1027_125147_000082_000007	train-clean-360	Never fall into his hands Lammle I beg of you as a friend 
none	none	mister Lammle disclosing some alarm at the solemnity of this affectionate adjuration demanded why the devil he ever should fall into the hands of Pubsey and company To confess the fact I was made a little uneasy said the candid Fledgeby by the manner in which that Jew looked at you when he heard your name 
1027_125147_000084_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t like his eye 
none	none	But it may have been the heated fancy of a friend 
1027_125147_000084_000003	train-clean-360	Of course if you are sure that you have no personal security out which you may not be quite equal to meeting and which can have got into his hands it must have been fancy 
1027_125147_000084_000004	train-clean-360	Still I didn t like his eye 
1027_125147_000085_000000	train-clean-360	The brooding Lammle with certain white dints coming and going in his palpitating nose looked as if some tormenting imp were pinching it Fledgeby watching him with a twitch in his mean face which did duty there for a smile looked very like the tormentor who was pinching 
1027_125147_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 But I mustn t keep him waiting too long said Fledgeby or he ll revenge it on my unfortunate friend 
1027_125147_000086_000001	train-clean-360	How s your very clever and agreeable wife 
none	none	She knows we have broken down
1027_125147_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 I showed her the letter 
none	none	Very much surprised asked Fledgeby I think she would have been more so answered Lammle if there had been more go in YOU
1027_125147_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh She lays it upon me then 
none	none	mister Fledgeby I will not have my words misconstrued
1027_125147_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t break out Lammle urged Fledgeby in a submissive tone because there s no occasion 
1027_125147_000092_000001	train-clean-360	I only asked a question 
1027_125147_000092_000002	train-clean-360	Then she don t lay it upon me 
1027_125147_000092_000003	train-clean-360	To ask another question 
none	none	No sir Very good said Fledgeby plainly seeing that she did
1027_125147_000094_000001	train-clean-360	 My compliments to her 
none	none	Good bye 
1027_125147_000095_000000	train-clean-360	They shook hands and Lammle strode out pondering 
none	none	Fledgeby saw him into the fog and returning to the fire and musing with his face to it stretched the legs of the rose coloured Turkish trousers wide apart and meditatively bent his knees as if he were going down upon them
1027_125147_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 You have a pair of whiskers Lammle which I never liked murmured Fledgeby and which money can t produce you are boastful of your manners and your conversation you wanted to pull my nose and you have let me in for a failure and your wife says I am the cause of it 
none	none	I ll bowl you down I will though I have no whiskers here he rubbed the places where they were due and no manners and no conversation Having thus relieved his noble mind he collected the legs of the Turkish trousers straightened himself on his knees and called out to Riah in the next room Halloa you sir At sight of the old man re entering with a gentleness monstrously in contrast with the character he had given him mister Fledgeby was so tickled again that he exclaimed laughing Good Good Upon my soul it is uncommon good Now old un proceeded Fledgeby when he had had his laugh out you ll buy up these lots that I mark with my pencil there s a tick there and a tick there and a tick there and I wager two pence you ll afterwards go on squeezing those Christians like the Jew you are Now next you ll want a cheque or you ll say you want it though you ve capital enough somewhere if one only knew where but you d be peppered and salted and grilled on a gridiron before you d own to it and that cheque I ll write When he had unlocked a drawer and taken a key from it to open another drawer in which was another key that opened another drawer in which was another key that opened another drawer in which was the cheque book and when he had written the cheque and when reversing the key and drawer process he had placed his cheque book in safety again he beckoned the old man with the folded cheque to come and take it Old un said Fledgeby when the Jew had put it in his pocketbook and was putting that in the breast of his outer garment so much at present for my affairs 
1027_125147_000100_000001	train-clean-360	Now a word about affairs that are not exactly mine Where is she 
none	none	With his hand not yet withdrawn from the breast of his garment Riah started and paused
1027_125147_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Oho said Fledgeby Didn t expect it 
none	none	Where have you hidden her 
1027_125147_000103_000000	train-clean-360	Showing that he was taken by surprise the old man looked at his master with some passing confusion which the master highly enjoyed 
none	none	Is she in the house I pay rent and taxes for in Saint Mary Axe demanded Fledgeby No sir Is she in your garden up atop of that house gone up to be dead or whatever the game is asked Fledgeby No sir
1027_125147_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is she then 
1027_125147_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Riah bent his eyes upon the ground as if considering whether he could answer the question without breach of faith and then silently raised them to Fledgeby s face as if he could not 
1027_125147_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Come said Fledgeby I won t press that just now 
1027_125147_000110_000001	train-clean-360	But I want to know this and I will know this mind you 
none	none	What are you up to 
1027_125147_000111_000000	train-clean-360	The old man with an apologetic action of his head and hands as not comprehending the master s meaning addressed to him a look of mute inquiry 
none	none	You can t be a gallivanting dodger said Fledgeby For you re a regular pity the sorrows you know if you DO know any Christian rhyme whose trembling limbs have borne him to et cetrer You re one of the Patriarchs you re a shaky old card and you can t be in love with this Lizzie
1027_125147_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 O sir expostulated Riah 
1027_125147_000113_000001	train-clean-360	 O sir sir sir 
1027_125147_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why retorted Fledgeby with some slight tinge of a blush don t you out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all 
1027_125147_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir I will tell you the truth 
1027_125147_000115_000001	train-clean-360	But your pardon for the stipulation it is in sacred confidence it is strictly upon honour 
1027_125147_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 Honour too cried Fledgeby with a mocking lip 
none	none	Honour among Jews Well Cut away
1027_125147_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 It is upon honour sir the other still stipulated with respectful firmness 
1027_125147_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh certainly 
1027_125147_000118_000001	train-clean-360	Honour bright said Fledgeby 
1027_125147_000119_000000	train-clean-360	The old man never bidden to sit down stood with an earnest hand laid on the back of the young man s easy chair 
1027_125147_000119_000001	train-clean-360	The young man sat looking at the fire with a face of listening curiosity ready to check him off and catch him tripping 
1027_125147_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 Cut away said Fledgeby Start with your motive 
1027_125147_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir I have no motive but to help the helpless 
1027_125147_000122_000000	train-clean-360	mister Fledgeby could only express the feelings to which this incredible statement gave rise in his breast by a prodigiously long derisive sniff 
none	none	How I came to know and much to esteem and to respect this damsel I mentioned when you saw her in my poor garden on the house top said the Jew
1027_125147_000124_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you said Fledgeby distrustfully 
none	none	Well 
1027_125147_000124_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps you did though 
1027_125147_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 The better I knew her the more interest I felt in her fortunes 
1027_125147_000125_000001	train-clean-360	They gathered to a crisis 
1027_125147_000125_000002	train-clean-360	I found her beset by a selfish and ungrateful brother beset by an unacceptable wooer beset by the snares of a more powerful lover beset by the wiles of her own heart 
1027_125147_000126_000000	train-clean-360	 She took to one of the chaps then 
1027_125147_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir it was only natural that she should incline towards him for he had many and great advantages 
none	none	But he was not of her station and to marry her was not in his mind 
1027_125147_000127_000002	train-clean-360	Perils were closing round her and the circle was fast darkening when I being as you have said sir too old and broken to be suspected of any feeling for her but a father s stepped in and counselled flight 
1027_125147_000127_000003	train-clean-360	I said My daughter there are times of moral danger when the hardest virtuous resolution to form is flight and when the most heroic bravery is flight She answered she had had this in her thoughts but whither to fly without help she knew not and there were none to help her 
1027_125147_000127_000004	train-clean-360	I showed her there was one to help her and it was I And she is gone 
1027_125147_000128_000000	train-clean-360	 What did you do with her asked Fledgeby feeling his cheek 
1027_125147_000129_000000	train-clean-360	 I placed her said the old man at a distance with a grave smooth outward sweep from one another of his two open hands at arm s length at a distance among certain of our people where her industry would serve her and where she could hope to exercise it unassailed from any quarter 
1027_125147_000130_000000	train-clean-360	Fledgeby s eyes had come from the fire to notice the action of his hands when he said at a distance Fledgeby now tried very unsuccessfully to imitate that action as he shook his head and said Placed her in that direction did you 
1027_125147_000130_000001	train-clean-360	Oh you circular old dodger 
1027_125147_000131_000000	train-clean-360	With one hand across his breast and the other on the easy chair Riah without justifying himself waited for further questioning 
1027_125147_000131_000001	train-clean-360	But that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point Fledgeby with his small eyes too near together saw full well 
1027_125147_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 Lizzie said Fledgeby looking at the fire again and then looking up Humph Lizzie 
none	none	You didn t tell me the other name in your garden atop of the house 
1027_125147_000132_000002	train-clean-360	I ll be more communicative with you 
1027_125147_000132_000003	train-clean-360	The other name s Hexam 
none	none	Riah bent his head in assent Look here you sir said Fledgeby I have a notion I know something of the inveigling chap the powerful one 
1027_125147_000134_000001	train-clean-360	Has he anything to do with the law 
none	none	Nominally I believe it his calling
1027_125147_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought so 
none	none	Name anything like Lightwood Sir not at all like Come old un said Fledgeby meeting his eyes with a wink say the name Wrayburn
1027_125147_000140_000000	train-clean-360	 By Jupiter cried Fledgeby 
1027_125147_000140_000001	train-clean-360	 That one is it 
none	none	I thought it might be the other but I never dreamt of that one I shouldn t object to your baulking either of the pair dodger for they are both conceited enough but that one is as cool a customer as ever I met with 
1027_125147_000140_000004	train-clean-360	Got a beard besides and presumes upon it 
none	none	Well done old un 
1027_125147_000140_000006	train-clean-360	Go on and prosper 
none	none	Brightened by this unexpected commendation Riah asked were there more instructions for him No said Fledgeby you may toddle now Judah and grope about on the orders you have got Dismissed with those pleasing words the old man took his broad hat and staff and left the great presence more as if he were some superior creature benignantly blessing mister Fledgeby than the poor dependent on whom he set his foot 
1027_125147_000142_000001	train-clean-360	Left alone mister Fledgeby locked his outer door and came back to his fire 
1027_125147_000143_000000	train-clean-360	 Well done you said Fascination to himself 
1027_125147_000143_000001	train-clean-360	 Slow you may be sure you are This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency as he again dispersed the legs of the Turkish trousers and bent the knees 
1027_125147_000144_000000	train-clean-360	 A tidy shot that I flatter myself he then soliloquised 
1027_125147_000144_000001	train-clean-360	 And a Jew brought down with it 
none	none	Now when I heard the story told at Lammle s I didn t make a jump at Riah Not a hit of it I got at him by degrees Herein he was quite accurate it being his habit not to jump or leap or make an upward spring at anything in life but to crawl at everything I got at him pursued Fledgeby feeling for his whisker by degrees If your Lammles or your Lightwoods had got at him anyhow they would have asked him the question whether he hadn t something to do with that gal s disappearance I knew a better way of going to work 
1027_125147_000145_000002	train-clean-360	Having got behind the hedge and put him in the light I took a shot at him and brought him down plump 
none	none	Oh It don t count for much being a Jew in a match against ME 
1027_125147_000146_000000	train-clean-360	Another dry twist in place of a smile made his face crooked here 
1027_125147_000147_000000	train-clean-360	 As to Christians proceeded Fledgeby look out fellow Christians particularly you that lodge in Queer Street 
1027_125147_000147_000001	train-clean-360	I have got the run of Queer Street now and you shall see some games there 
none	none	To work a lot of power over you and you not know it knowing as you think yourselves would be almost worth laying out money upon But when it comes to squeezing a profit out of you into the bargain it s something like 
1027_125147_000148_000000	train-clean-360	With this apostrophe mister Fledgeby appropriately proceeded to divest himself of his Turkish garments and invest himself with Christian attire 
1027_125147_000148_000001	train-clean-360	Pending which operation and his morning ablutions and his anointing of himself with the last infallible preparation for the production of luxuriant and glossy hair upon the human countenance quacks being the only sages he believed in besides usurers the murky fog closed about him and shut him up in its sooty embrace 
1027_125147_000148_000002	train-clean-360	If it had never let him out any more the world would have had no irreparable loss but could have easily replaced him from its stock on hand 
none	none	Chapter two A RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT In the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow window blind of Pubsey and company was drawn down upon the day s work Riah the Jew once more came forth into Saint Mary Axe But this time he carried no bag and was not bound on his master s affairs He passed over London Bridge and returned to the Middlesex shore by that of Westminster and so ever wading through the fog waded to the doorstep of the dolls dressmaker Miss Wren expected him He could see her through the window by the light of her low fire carefully banked up with damp cinders that it might last the longer and waste the less when she was out sitting waiting for him in her bonnet His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat and she came to the door to open it aiding her steps with a little crutch stick Good evening godmother said Miss Jenny Wren The old man laughed and gave her his arm to lean on Won t you come in and warm yourself godmother asked Miss Jenny Wren Not if you are ready Cinderella my dear Well exclaimed Miss Wren delighted Now you ARE a clever old boy If we gave prizes at this establishment but we only keep blanks you should have the first silver medal for taking me up so quick As she spake thus Miss Wren removed the key of the house door from the keyhole and put it in her pocket and then bustlingly closed the door and tried it as they both stood on the step Satisfied that her dwelling was safe she drew one hand through the old man s arm and prepared to ply her crutch stick with the other But the key was an instrument of such gigantic proportions that before they started Riah proposed to carry it No no no I ll carry it myself returned Miss Wren I m awfully lopsided you know and stowed down in my pocket it ll trim the ship To let you into a secret godmother I wear my pocket on my high side o purpose With that they began their plodding through the fog Yes it was truly sharp of you godmother resumed Miss Wren with great approbation to understand me But you see you ARE so like the fairy godmother in the bright little books You look so unlike the rest of people and so much as if you had changed yourself into that shape just this moment with some benevolent object Boh cried Miss Jenny putting her face close to the old man s I can see your features godmother behind the beard Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too Jenny Ah That it does If you d only borrow my stick and tap this piece of pavement this dirty stone that my foot taps it would start up a coach and six I say Let s believe so With all my heart replied the good old man And I ll tell you what I must ask you to do godmother I must ask you to be so kind as give my child a tap and change him altogether O my child has been such a bad bad child of late It worries me nearly out of my wits Not done a stroke of work these ten days Has had the horrors too and fancied that four copper coloured men in red wanted to throw him into a fiery furnace But that s dangerous Jenny Dangerous godmother My child is always dangerous more or less He might here the little creature glanced back over her shoulder at the sky be setting the house on fire at this present moment I don t know who would have a child for my part It s no use shaking him I have shaken him till I have made myself giddy Why don t you mind your Commandments and honour your parent you naughty old boy I said to him all the time But he only whimpered and stared at me What shall be changed after him asked Riah in a compassionately playful voice Upon my word godmother I am afraid I must be selfish next and get you to set me right in the back and the legs It s a little thing to you with your power godmother but it s a great deal to poor weak aching me There was no querulous complaining in the words but they were not the less touching for that And then Yes and then YOU know godmother We ll both jump up into the coach and six and go to Lizzie This reminds me godmother to ask you a serious question You are as wise as wise can be having been brought up by the fairies and you can tell me this Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it or never to have had it Explain god daughter I feel so much more solitary and helpless without Lizzie now than I used to feel before I knew her Tears were in her eyes as she said so Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives my dear said the Jew that of a wife and a fair daughter and a son of promise has faded out of my own life but the happiness was Ah said Miss Wren thoughtfully by no means convinced and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers then I tell you what change I think you had better begin with godmother You had better change Is into Was and Was into Is and keep them so Would that suit your case Would you not be always in pain then asked the old man tenderly Right exclaimed Miss Wren with another chop You have changed me wiser godmother Not she added with the quaint hitch of her chin and eyes that you need be a very wonderful godmother to do that deed Thus conversing and having crossed Westminster Bridge they traversed the ground that Riah had lately traversed and new ground likewise for when they had recrossed the Thames by way of London Bridge they struck down by the river and held their still foggier course that way But previously as they were going along Jenny twisted her venerable friend aside to a brilliantly lighted toy shop window and said Now look at em All my work This referred to a dazzling semicircle of dolls in all the colours of the rainbow who were dressed for presentation at court for going to balls for going out driving for going out on horseback for going out walking for going to get married for going to help other dolls to get married for all the gay events of life Pretty pretty pretty said the old man with a clap of his hands Most elegant taste Glad you like em returned Miss Wren loftily But the fun is godmother how I make the great ladies try my dresses on Though it s the hardest part of my business and would be even if my back were not bad and my legs queer He looked at her as not understanding what she said Bless you godmother said Miss Wren I have to scud about town at all hours If it was only sitting at my bench cutting out and sewing it would be comparatively easy work but it s the trying on by the great ladies that takes it out of me How the trying on asked Riah What a mooney godmother you are after all returned Miss Wren Look here There s a Drawing Room or a grand day in the Park or a Show or a Fete or what you like Very well I squeeze among the crowd and I look about me When I see a great lady very suitable for my business I say You ll do my dear and I take particular notice of her and run home and cut her out and baste her Then another day I come scudding back again to try on and then I take particular notice of her again Sometimes she plainly seems to say How that little creature is staring and sometimes likes it and sometimes don t but much more often yes than no All the time I am only saying to myself I must hollow out a bit here I must slope away there and I am making a perfect slave of her with making her try on my doll s dress Evening parties are severer work for me because there s only a doorway for a full view and what with hobbling among the wheels of the carriages and the legs of the horses I fully expect to be run over some night However there I have em just the same When they go bobbing into the hall from the carriage and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy poked out from behind a policeman s cape in the rain I dare say they think I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart but they little think they re only working for my dolls There was Lady Belinda Whitrose I made her do double duty in one night I said when she came out of the carriage YOU ll do my dear and I ran straight home and cut her out and basted her Back I came again and waited behind the men that called the carriages Very bad night too At last Lady Belinda Whitrose s carriage Lady Belinda Whitrose coming down And I made her try on oh and take pains about it too before she got seated That s Lady Belinda hanging up by the waist much too near the gaslight for a wax one with her toes turned in When they had plodded on for some time nigh the river Riah asked the way to a certain tavern called the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters Following the directions he received they arrived after two or three puzzled stoppages for consideration and some uncertain looking about them at the door of Miss Abbey Potterson s dominions A peep through the glass portion of the door revealed to them the glories of the bar and Miss Abbey herself seated in state on her snug throne reading the newspaper To whom with deference they presented themselves Taking her eyes off her newspaper and pausing with a suspended expression of countenance as if she must finish the paragraph in hand before undertaking any other business whatever Miss Abbey demanded with some slight asperity Now then what s for you Could we see Miss Potterson asked the old man uncovering his head You not only could but you can and you do replied the hostess Might we speak with you madam By this time Miss Abbey s eyes had possessed themselves of the small figure of Miss Jenny Wren For the closer observation of which Miss Abbey laid aside her newspaper rose and looked over the half door of the bar The crutch stick seemed to entreat for its owner leave to come in and rest by the fire so Miss Abbey opened the half door and said as though replying to the crutch stick Yes come in and rest by the fire My name is Riah said the old man with courteous action and my avocation is in London city This my young companion Stop a bit interposed Miss Wren I ll give the lady my card She produced it from her pocket with an air after struggling with the gigantic door key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down Miss Abbey with manifest tokens of astonishment took the diminutive document and found it to run concisely thus MISS JENNY WREN DOLLS DRESSMAKER Dolls attended at their own residences Lud exclaimed Miss Potterson staring And dropped the card We take the liberty of coming my young companion and I madam said Riah on behalf of Lizzie Hexam Miss Potterson was stooping to loosen the bonnet strings of the dolls dressmaker She looked round rather angrily and said Lizzie Hexam is a very proud young woman She would be so proud returned Riah dexterously to stand well in your good opinion that before she quitted London for For where in the name of the Cape of Good Hope asked Miss Potterson as though supposing her to have emigrated For the country was the cautious answer she made us promise to come and show you a paper which she left in our hands for that special purpose I am an unserviceable friend of hers who began to know her after her departure from this neighbourhood She has been for some time living with my young companion and has been a helpful and a comfortable friend to her Much needed madam he added in a lower voice Believe me if you knew all much needed I can believe that said Miss Abbey with a softening glance at the little creature And if it s proud to have a heart that never hardens and a temper that never tires and a touch that never hurts Miss Jenny struck in flushed she is proud And if it s not she is NOT Her set purpose of contradicting Miss Abbey point blank was so far from offending that dread authority as to elicit a gracious smile You do right child said Miss Abbey to speak well of those who deserve well of you Right or wrong muttered Miss Wren inaudibly with a visible hitch of her chin I mean to do it and you may make up your mind to THAT old lady Here is the paper madam said the Jew delivering into Miss Potterson s hands the original document drawn up by Rokesmith and signed by Riderhood Will you please to read it But first of all said Miss Abbey did you ever taste shrub child Miss Wren shook her head Should you like to Should if it s good returned Miss Wren You shall try And if you find it good I ll mix some for you with hot water Put your poor little feet on the fender It s a cold cold night and the fog clings so As Miss Abbey helped her to turn her chair her loosened bonnet dropped on the floor Why what lovely hair cried Miss Abbey And enough to make wigs for all the dolls in the world What a quantity Call THAT a quantity returned Miss Wren Poof What do you say to the rest of it As she spoke she untied a band and the golden stream fell over herself and over the chair and flowed down to the ground Miss Abbey s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity She beckoned the Jew towards her as she reached down the shrub bottle from its niche and whispered Child or woman Child in years was the answer woman in self reliance and trial You are talking about Me good people thought Miss Jenny sitting in her golden bower warming her feet I can t hear what you say but I know your tricks and your manners The shrub when tasted from a spoon perfectly harmonizing with Miss Jenny s palate a judicious amount was mixed by Miss Potterson s skilful hands whereof Riah too partook After this preliminary Miss Abbey read the document and as often as she raised her eyebrows in so doing the watchful Miss Jenny accompanied the action with an expressive and emphatic sip of the shrub and water As far as this goes said Miss Abbey Potterson when she had read it several times and thought about it it proves what didn t much need proving that Rogue Riderhood is a villain I have my doubts whether he is not the villain who solely did the deed but I have no expectation of those doubts ever being cleared up now I believe I did Lizzie s father wrong but never Lizzie s self because when things were at the worst I trusted her had perfect confidence in her and tried to persuade her to come to me for a refuge I am very sorry to have done a man wrong particularly when it can t be undone Be kind enough to let Lizzie know what I say not forgetting that if she will come to the Porters after all bygones being bygones she will find a home at the Porters and a friend at the Porters She knows Miss Abbey of old remind her and she knows what like the home and what like the friend is likely to turn out I am generally short and sweet or short and sour according as it may be and as opinions vary remarked Miss Abbey and that s about all I have got to say and enough too But before the shrub and water was sipped out Miss Abbey bethought herself that she would like to keep a copy of the paper by her It s not long sir said she to Riah and perhaps you wouldn t mind just jotting it down The old man willingly put on his spectacles and standing at the little desk in the corner where Miss Abbey filed her receipts and kept her sample phials customers scores were interdicted by the strict administration of the Porters wrote out the copy in a fair round character As he stood there doing his methodical penmanship his ancient scribelike figure intent upon the work and the little dolls dressmaker sitting in her golden bower before the fire Miss Abbey had her doubts whether she had not dreamed those two rare figures into the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowships and might not wake with a nod next moment and find them gone Miss Abbey had twice made the experiment of shutting her eyes and opening them again still finding the figures there when dreamlike a confused hubbub arose in the public room As she started up and they all three looked at one another it became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river A moment more and Bob Gliddery came clattering along the passage with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail What is it asked Miss Abbey It s summut run down in the fog ma am answered Bob There s ever so many people in the river Tell em to put on all the kettles cried Miss Abbey See that the boiler s full Get a bath out Hang some blankets to the fire Heat some stone bottles Have your senses about you you girls down stairs and use em While Miss Abbey partly delivered these directions to Bob whom she seized by the hair and whose head she knocked against the wall as a general injunction to vigilance and presence of mind and partly hailed the kitchen with them the company in the public room jostling one another rushed out to the causeway and the outer noise increased Come and look said Miss Abbey to her visitors They all three hurried to the vacated public room and passed by one of the windows into the wooden verandah overhanging the river Does anybody down there know what has happened demanded Miss Abbey in her voice of authority It s a steamer Miss Abbey cried one blurred figure in the fog It always IS a steamer Miss Abbey cried another Them s her lights Miss Abbey wot you see a blinking yonder cried another She s a blowing off her steam Miss Abbey and that s what makes the fog and the noise worse don t you see explained another Boats were putting off torches were lighting up people were rushing tumultuously to the water s edge Some man fell in with a splash and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter The drags were called for A cry for the life buoy passed from mouth to mouth It was impossible to make out what was going on upon the river for every boat that put off sculled into the fog and was lost to view at a boat s length Nothing was clear but that the unpopular steamer was assailed with reproaches on all sides She was the Murderer bound for Gallows Bay she was the Manslaughterer bound for Penal Settlement her captain ought to be tried for his life her crew ran down men in row boats with a relish she mashed up Thames lightermen with her paddles she fired property with her funnels she always was and she always would be wreaking destruction upon somebody or something after the manner of all her kind The whole bulk of the fog teemed with such taunts uttered in tones of universal hoarseness All the while the steamer s lights moved spectrally a very little as she lay to waiting the upshot of whatever accident had happened Now she began burning blue lights These made a luminous patch about her as if she had set the fog on fire and in the patch the cries changing their note and becoming more fitful and more excited shadows of men and boats could be seen moving while voices shouted There There again A couple more strokes a head Hurrah Look out Hold on Haul in and the like Lastly with a few tumbling clots of blue fire the night closed in dark again the wheels of the steamer were heard revolving and her lights glided smoothly away in the direction of the sea It appeared to Miss Abbey and her two companions that a considerable time had been thus occupied There was now as eager a set towards the shore beneath the house as there had been from it and it was only on the first boat of the rush coming in that it was known what had occurred If that s Tom Tootle Miss Abbey made proclamation in her most commanding tones let him instantly come underneath here The submissive Tom complied attended by a crowd What is it Tootle demanded Miss Abbey It s a foreign steamer miss run down a wherry How many in the wherry One man Miss Abbey Found Yes He s been under water a long time Miss but they ve grappled up the body Let em bring it here You Bob Gliddery shut the house door and stand by it on the inside and don t you open till I tell you Any police down there Here Miss Abbey was official rejoinder After they have brought the body in keep the crowd out will you And help Bob Gliddery to shut em out All right Miss Abbey The autocratic landlady withdrew into the house with Riah and Miss Jenny and disposed those forces one on either side of her within the half door of the bar as behind a breastwork You two stand close here said Miss Abbey and you ll come to no hurt and see it brought in Bob you stand by the door That sentinel smartly giving his rolled shirt sleeves an extra and a final tuck on his shoulders obeyed Sound of advancing voices sound of advancing steps Shuffle and talk without Momentary pause Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet That s the stretcher or the shutter whichever of the two they are carrying said Miss Abbey with experienced ear Open you Bob Door opened Heavy tread of laden men A halt A rush Stoppage of rush Door shut Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders Come on men said Miss Abbey for so potent was she with her subjects that even then the bearers awaited her permission First floor The entry being low and the staircase being low they so took up the burden they had set down as to carry that low The recumbent figure in passing lay hardly as high as the half door Miss Abbey started back at sight of it Why good God said she turning to her two companions that s the very man who made the declaration we have just had in our hands That s Riderhood Chapter three THE SAME RESPECTED FRIEND IN MORE ASPECTS THAN ONE In sooth it is Riderhood and no other or it is the outer husk and shell of Riderhood and no other that is borne into Miss Abbey s first floor bedroom Supple to twist and turn as the Rogue has ever been he is sufficiently rigid now and not without much shuffling of attendant feet and tilting of his bier this way and that way and peril even of his sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the balustrades can he be got up stairs Fetch a doctor quoth Miss Abbey And then Fetch his daughter On both of which errands quick messengers depart The doctor seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway coming under convoy of police Doctor examines the dank carcase and pronounces not hopefully that it is worth while trying to reanimate the same All the best means are at once in action and everybody present lends a hand and a heart and soul No one has the least regard for the man with them all he has been an object of avoidance suspicion and aversion but the spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now and they have a deep interest in it probably because it IS life and they are living and must die In answer to the doctor s inquiry how did it happen and was anyone to blame Tom Tootle gives in his verdict unavoidable accident and no one to blame but the sufferer He was slinking about in his boat says Tom which slinking were not to speak ill of the dead the manner of the man when he come right athwart the steamer s bows and she cut him in two mister Tootle is so far figurative touching the dismemberment as that he means the boat and not the man For the man lies whole before them Captain Joey the bottle nosed regular customer in the glazed hat is a pupil of the much respected old school and having insinuated himself into the chamber in the execution of the important service of carrying the drowned man s neck kerchief favours the doctor with a sagacious old scholastic suggestion that the body should be hung up by the heels sim lar says Captain Joey to mutton in a butcher s shop and should then as a particularly choice manoeuvre for promoting easy respiration be rolled upon casks These scraps of the wisdom of the captain s ancestors are received with such speechless indignation by Miss Abbey that she instantly seizes the Captain by the collar and without a single word ejects him not presuming to remonstrate from the scene There then remain to assist the doctor and Tom only those three other regular customers Bob Glamour William Williams and Jonathan family name of the latter if any unknown to man kind who are quite enough Miss Abbey having looked in to make sure that nothing is wanted descends to the bar and there awaits the result with the gentle Jew and Miss Jenny Wren If you are not gone for good mister Riderhood it would be something to know where you are hiding at present This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance yields no sign of you If you are gone for good Rogue it is very solemn and if you are coming back it is hardly less so Nay in the suspense and mystery of the latter question involving that of where you may be now there is a solemnity even added to that of death making us who are in attendance alike afraid to look on you and to look off you and making those below start at the least sound of a creaking plank in the floor Stay Did that eyelid tremble So the doctor breathing low and closely watching asks himself No Did that nostril twitch No This artificial respiration ceasing do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest No Over and over again No No But try over and over again nevertheless See A token of life An indubitable token of life The spark may smoulder and go out or it may glow and expand but see The four rough fellows seeing shed tears Neither Riderhood in this world nor Riderhood in the other could draw tears from them but a striving human soul between the two can do it easily He is struggling to come back Now he is almost here now he is far away again Now he is struggling harder to get back And yet like us all when we swoon like us all every day of our lives when we wake he is instinctively unwilling to be restored to the consciousness of this existence and would be left dormant if he could Bob Gliddery returns with Pleasant Riderhood who was out when sought for and hard to find She has a shawl over her head and her first action when she takes it off weeping and curtseys to Miss Abbey is to wind her hair up Thank you Miss Abbey for having father here I am bound to say girl I didn t know who it was returns Miss Abbey but I hope it would have been pretty much the same if I had known Poor Pleasant fortified with a sip of brandy is ushered into the first floor chamber She could not express much sentiment about her father if she were called upon to pronounce his funeral oration but she has a greater tenderness for him than he ever had for her and crying bitterly when she sees him stretched unconscious asks the doctor with clasped hands Is there no hope sir O poor father Is poor father dead To which the doctor on one knee beside the body busy and watchful only rejoins without looking round Now my girl unless you have the self command to be perfectly quiet I cannot allow you to remain in the room Pleasant consequently wipes her eyes with her back hair which is in fresh need of being wound up and having got it out of the way watches with terrified interest all that goes on Her natural woman s aptitude soon renders her able to give a little help Anticipating the doctor s want of this or that she quietly has it ready for him and so by degrees is intrusted with the charge of supporting her father s head upon her arm It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before Some hazy idea that if affairs could remain thus for a long time it would be a respectable change floats in her mind Also some vague idea that the old evil is drowned out of him and that if he should happily come back to resume his occupation of the empty form that lies upon the bed his spirit will be altered In which state of mind she kisses the stony lips and quite believes that the impassive hand she chafes will revive a tender hand if it revive ever Sweet delusion for Pleasant Riderhood But they minister to him with such extraordinary interest their anxiety is so keen their vigilance is so great their excited joy grows so intense as the signs of life strengthen that how can she resist it poor thing And now he begins to breathe naturally and he stirs and the doctor declares him to have come back from that inexplicable journey where he stopped on the dark road and to be here Tom Tootle who is nearest to the doctor when he says this grasps the doctor fervently by the hand Bob Glamour William Williams and Jonathan of the no surname all shake hands with one another round and with the doctor too Bob Glamour blows his nose and Jonathan of the no surname is moved to do likewise but lacking a pocket handkerchief abandons that outlet for his emotion Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name and her sweet delusion is at its height There is intelligence in his eyes He wants to ask a question He wonders where he is Tell him Father you were run down on the river and are at Miss Abbey Potterson s He stares at his daughter stares all around him closes his eyes and lies slumbering on her arm The short lived delusion begins to fade The low bad unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river or what other depths to the surface again As he grows warm the doctor and the four men cool As his lineaments soften with life their faces and their hearts harden to him He will do now says the doctor washing his hands and looking at the patient with growing disfavour Many a better man moralizes Tom Tootle with a gloomy shake of the head ain t had his luck It s to be hoped he ll make a better use of his life says Bob Glamour than I expect he will Or than he done afore adds William Williams But no not he says Jonathan of the no surname clinching the quartette They speak in a low tone because of his daughter but she sees that they have all drawn off and that they stand in a group at the other end of the room shunning him It would be too much to suspect them of being sorry that he didn t die when he had done so much towards it but they clearly wish that they had had a better subject to bestow their pains on Intelligence is conveyed to Miss Abbey in the bar who reappears on the scene and contemplates from a distance holding whispered discourse with the doctor The spark of life was deeply interesting while it was in abeyance but now that it has got established in mister Riderhood there appears to be a general desire that circumstances had admitted of its being developed in anybody else rather than that gentleman However says Miss Abbey cheering them up you have done your duty like good and true men and you had better come down and take something at the expense of the Porters This they all do leaving the daughter watching the father To whom in their absence Bob Gliddery presents himself His gills looks rum don t they says Bob after inspecting the patient Pleasant faintly nods His gills ll look rummer when he wakes won t they says Bob Pleasant hopes not Why When he finds himself here you know Bob explains Cause Miss Abbey forbid him the house and ordered him out of it But what you may call the Fates ordered him into it again Which is rumness ain t it He wouldn t have come here of his own accord returns poor Pleasant with an effort at a little pride No retorts Bob Nor he wouldn t have been let in if he had The short delusion is quite dispelled now As plainly as she sees on her arm the old father unimproved Pleasant sees that everybody there will cut him when he recovers consciousness I ll take him away ever so soon as I can thinks Pleasant with a sigh he s best at home Presently they all return and wait for him to become conscious that they will all be glad to get rid of him Some clothes are got together for him to wear his own being saturated with water and his present dress being composed of blankets Becoming more and more uncomfortable as though the prevalent dislike were finding him out somewhere in his sleep and expressing itself to him the patient at last opens his eyes wide and is assisted by his daughter to sit up in bed Well Riderhood says the doctor how do you feel He replies gruffly Nothing to boast on Having in fact returned to life in an uncommonly sulky state I don t mean to preach but I hope says the doctor gravely shaking his head that this escape may have a good effect upon you Riderhood The patient s discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible his daughter however could interpret if she would that what he says is he don t want no Poll Parroting mister Riderhood next demands his shirt and draws it on over his head with his daughter s help exactly as if he had just had a Fight Warn t it a steamer he pauses to ask her Yes father I ll have the law on her bust her and make her pay for it He then buttons his linen very moodily twice or thrice stopping to examine his arms and hands as if to see what punishment he has received in the Fight He then doggedly demands his other garments and slowly gets them on with an appearance of great malevolence towards his late opponent and all the spectators He has an impression that his nose is bleeding and several times draws the back of his hand across it and looks for the result in a pugilistic manner greatly strengthening that incongruous resemblance Where s my fur cap he asks in a surly voice when he has shuffled his clothes on In the river somebody rejoins And warn t there no honest man to pick it up O course there was though and to cut off with it arterwards You are a rare lot all on you Thus mister Riderhood taking from the hands of his daughter with special ill will a lent cap and grumbling as he pulls it down over his ears Then getting on his unsteady legs leaning heavily upon her and growling Hold still can t you What You must be a staggering next must you he takes his departure out of the ring in which he has had that little turn up with Death Chapter four A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY mister and missus Wilfer had seen a full quarter of a hundred more anniversaries of their wedding day than mister and missus Lammle had seen of theirs but they still celebrated the occasion in the bosom of their family Not that these celebrations ever resulted in anything particularly agreeable or that the family was ever disappointed by that circumstance on account of having looked forward to the return of the auspicious day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment It was kept morally rather as a Fast than a Feast enabling missus Wilfer to hold a sombre darkling state which exhibited that impressive woman in her choicest colours The noble lady s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness Lurid indications of the better marriages she might have made shone athwart the awful gloom of her composure and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little monster unaccountably favoured by Heaven who had possessed himself of a blessing for which many of his superiors had sued and contended in vain So firmly had this his position towards his treasure become established that when the anniversary arrived it always found him in an apologetic state It is not impossible that his modest penitence may have even gone the length of sometimes severely reproving him for that he ever took the liberty of making so exalted a character his wife As for the children of the union their experience of these festivals had been sufficiently uncomfortable to lead them annually to wish when out of their tenderest years either that Ma had married somebody else instead of much teased Pa or that Pa had married somebody else instead of Ma When there came to be but two sisters left at home the daring mind of Bella on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation what on earth Pa ever could have seen in Ma to induce him to make such a little fool of himself as to ask her to have him The revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence Bella arrived in the Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration It was the family custom when the day recurred to sacrifice a pair of fowls on the altar of Hymen and Bella had sent a note beforehand to intimate that she would bring the votive offering with her So Bella and the fowls by the united energies of two horses two men four wheels and a plum pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar on as if he had been George the Fourth were deposited at the door of the parental dwelling They were there received by missus Wilfer in person whose dignity on this as on most special occasions was heightened by a mysterious toothache I shall not require the carriage at night said Bella I shall walk back The male domestic of missus Boffin touched his hat and in the act of departure had an awful glare bestowed upon him by missus Wilfer intended to carry deep into his audacious soul the assurance that whatever his private suspicions might be male domestics in livery were no rarity there Well dear Ma said Bella and how do you do I am as well Bella replied missus Wilfer as can be expected Dear me Ma said Bella you talk as if one was just born That s exactly what Ma has been doing interposed Lavvy over the maternal shoulder ever since we got up this morning It s all very well to laugh Bella but anything more exasperating it is impossible to conceive missus Wilfer with a look too full of majesty to be accompanied by any words attended both her daughters to the kitchen where the sacrifice was to be prepared mister Rokesmith said she resignedly has been so polite as to place his sitting room at our disposal to day You will therefore Bella be entertained in the humble abode of your parents so far in accordance with your present style of living that there will be a drawing room for your reception as well as a dining room Your papa invited mister Rokesmith to partake of our lowly fare In excusing himself on account of a particular engagement he offered the use of his apartment Bella happened to know that he had no engagement out of his own room at mister Boffin s but she approved of his staying away We should only have put one another out of countenance she thought and we do that quite often enough as it is Yet she had sufficient curiosity about his room to run up to it with the least possible delay and make a close inspection of its contents It was tastefully though economically furnished and very neatly arranged There were shelves and stands of books English French and Italian and in a portfolio on the writing table there were sheets upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in figures evidently referring to the Boffin property On that table also carefully backed with canvas varnished mounted and rolled like a map was the placard descriptive of the murdered man who had come from afar to be her husband She shrank from this ghostly surprise and felt quite frightened as she rolled and tied it up again Peeping about here and there she came upon a print a graceful head of a pretty woman elegantly framed hanging in the corner by the easy chair Oh indeed sir said Bella after stopping to ruminate before it Oh indeed sir I fancy I can guess whom you think THAT S like But I ll tell you what it s much more like your impudence Having said which she decamped not solely because she was offended but because there was nothing else to look at Now Ma said Bella reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing but I intend to prove the contrary I mean to be Cook today Hold rejoined her majestic mother I cannot permit it Cook in that dress As for my dress Ma returned Bella merrily searching in a dresser drawer I mean to apron it and towel it all over the front and as to permission I mean to do without YOU cook said missus Wilfer YOU who never cooked when you were at home Yes Ma returned Bella that is precisely the state of the case She girded herself with a white apron and busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to it coming close and tight under her chin as if it had caught her round the neck to kiss her Over this bib her dimples looked delightful and under it her pretty figure not less so Now Ma said Bella pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands what s first First returned missus Wilfer solemnly if you persist in what I cannot but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived Which I do Ma First then you put the fowls down to the fire To be sure cried Bella and flour them and twirl them round and there they go sending them spinning at a great rate What s next Ma Next said missus Wilfer with a wave of her gloves expressive of abdication under protest from the culinary throne I would recommend examination of the bacon in the saucepan on the fire and also of the potatoes by the application of a fork Preparation of the greens will further become necessary if you persist in this unseemly demeanour As of course I do Ma Persisting Bella gave her attention to one thing and forgot the other and gave her attention to the other and forgot the third and remembering the third was distracted by the fourth and made amends whenever she went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin which made their chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful But it was pleasant cookery too Meantime Miss Lavinia oscillating between the kitchen and the opposite room prepared the dining table in the latter chamber This office she always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps laying the table cloth as if she were raising the wind putting down the glasses and salt cellars as if she were knocking at the door and clashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand to hand conflict Look at Ma whispered Lavinia to Bella when this was done and they stood over the roasting fowls If one was the most dutiful child in existence of course on the whole one hopes one is isn t she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden sitting there bolt upright in a corner Only suppose returned Bella that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner My dear he couldn t do it said Lavvy Pa would loll directly But indeed I do not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep so bolt upright as Ma or put such an amount of aggravation into one back What s the matter Ma Ain t you well Ma Doubtless I am very well returned missus Wilfer turning her eyes upon her youngest born with scornful fortitude What should be the matter with Me You don t seem very brisk Ma retorted Lavvy the bold Brisk repeated her parent Brisk Whence the low expression Lavinia If I am uncomplaining if I am silently contented with my lot let that suffice for my family Well Ma returned Lavvy since you will force it out of me I must respectfully take leave to say that your family are no doubt under the greatest obligations to you for having an annual toothache on your wedding day and that it s very disinterested in you and an immense blessing to them Still on the whole it is possible to be too boastful even of that boon You incarnation of sauciness said missus Wilfer do you speak like that to me On this day of all days in the year Pray do you know what would have become of you if I had not bestowed my hand upon R W your father on this day No Ma replied Lavvy I really do not and with the greatest respect for your abilities and information I very much doubt if you do either Whether or no the sharp vigour of this sally on a weak point of missus Wilfer s entrenchments might have routed that heroine for the time is rendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of truce in the person of mister George Sampson bidden to the feast as a friend of the family whose affections were now understood to be in course of transference from Bella to Lavinia and whom Lavinia kept possibly in remembrance of his bad taste in having overlooked her in the first instance under a course of stinging discipline I congratulate you missus Wilfer said mister George Sampson who had meditated this neat address while coming along on the day missus Wilfer thanked him with a magnanimous sigh and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache I am surprised said mister Sampson feebly that Miss Bella condescends to cook Here Miss Lavinia descended on the ill starred young gentleman with a crushing supposition that at all events it was no business of his This disposed of mister Sampson in a melancholy retirement of spirit until the cherub arrived whose amazement at the lovely woman s occupation was great However she persisted in dishing the dinner as well as cooking it and then sat down bibless and apronless to partake of it as an illustrious guest missus Wilfer first responding to her husband s cheerful For what we are about to receive with a sepulchral Amen calculated to cast a damp upon the stoutest appetite But what said Bella as she watched the carving of the fowls makes them pink inside I wonder Pa Is it the breed No I don t think it s the breed my dear returned Pa I rather think it is because they are not done They ought to be said Bella Yes I am aware they ought to be my dear rejoined her father but they ain t So the gridiron was put in requisition and the good tempered cherub who was often as un cherubically employed in his own family as if he had been in the employment of some of the Old Masters undertook to grill the fowls Indeed except in respect of staring about him a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype with the difference say that he performed with a blacking brush on the family s boots instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double basses and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions Bella helped him with his supplemental cookery and made him very happy but put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at table again how he supposed they cooked fowls at the Greenwich dinners and whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people said His secret winks and nods of remonstrance in reply made the mischievous Bella laugh until she choked and then Lavinia was obliged to slap her on the back and then she laughed the more But her mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table to whom her father in the innocence of his good fellowship at intervals appealed with My dear I am afraid you are not enjoying yourself Why so R W she would sonorously reply Because my dear you seem a little out of sorts Not at all would be the rejoinder in exactly the same tone Would you take a merry thought my dear Thank you I will take whatever you please R W Well but my dear do you like it I like it as well as I like anything R W The stately woman would then with a meritorious appearance of devoting herself to the general good pursue her dinner as if she were feeding somebody else on high public grounds Bella had brought dessert and two bottles of wine thus shedding unprecedented splendour on the occasion missus Wilfer did the honours of the first glass by proclaiming R W I drink to you Thank you my dear And I to you Pa and Ma said Bella Permit me missus Wilfer interposed with outstretched glove No I think not I drank to your papa If however you insist on including me I can in gratitude offer no objection Why Lor Ma interposed Lavvy the bold isn t it the day that made you and Pa one and the same I have no patience By whatever other circumstance the day may be marked it is not the day Lavinia on which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon me I beg nay command that you will not pounce R W it is appropriate to recall that it is for you to command and for me to obey It is your house and you are master at your own table Both our healths Drinking the toast with tremendous stiffness I really am a little afraid my dear hinted the cherub meekly that you are not enjoying yourself On the contrary returned missus Wilfer quite so Why should I not I thought my dear that perhaps your face might My face might be a martyrdom but what would that import or who should know it if I smiled And she did smile manifestly freezing the blood of mister George Sampson by so doing For that young gentleman catching her smiling eye was so very much appalled by its expression as to cast about in his thoughts concerning what he had done to bring it down upon himself The mind naturally falls said missus Wilfer shall I say into a reverie or shall I say into a retrospect on a day like this Lavvy sitting with defiantly folded arms replied but not audibly For goodness sake say whichever of the two you like best Ma and get it over The mind pursued missus Wilfer in an oratorical manner naturally reverts to Papa and Mamma I here allude to my parents at a period before the earliest dawn of this day I was considered tall perhaps I was Papa and Mamma were unquestionably tall I have rarely seen a finer women than my mother never than my father The irrepressible Lavvy remarked aloud Whatever grandpapa was he wasn t a female Your grandpapa retorted missus Wilfer with an awful look and in an awful tone was what I describe him to have been and would have struck any of his grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it It was one of mamma s cherished hopes that I should become united to a tall member of society It may have been a weakness but if so it was equally the weakness I believe of King Frederick of Prussia These remarks being offered to mister George Sampson who had not the courage to come out for single combat but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down missus Wilfer proceeded in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness until she should force that skulker to give himself up Mamma would appear to have had an indefinable foreboding of what afterwards happened for she would frequently urge upon me Not a little man Promise me my child not a little man Never never never marry a little man Papa also would remark to me he possessed extraordinary humour that a family of whales must not ally themselves with sprats His company was eagerly sought as may be supposed by the wits of the day and our house was their continual resort I have known as many as three copper plate engravers exchanging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there at one time Here mister Sampson delivered himself captive and said with an uneasy movement on his chair that three was a large number and it must have been highly entertaining Among the most prominent members of that distinguished circle was a gentleman measuring six feet four in height HE was NOT an engraver Here mister Sampson said with no reason whatever Of course not This gentleman was so obliging as to honour me with attentions which I could not fail to understand Here mister Sampson murmured that when it came to that you could always tell I immediately announced to both my parents that those attentions were misplaced and that I could not favour his suit They inquired was he too tall I replied it was not the stature but the intellect was too lofty At our house I said the tone was too brilliant the pressure was too high to be maintained by me a mere woman in every day domestic life I well remember mamma s clasping her hands and exclaiming This will end in a little man Here mister Sampson glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency She afterwards went so far as to predict that it would end in a little man whose mind would be below the average but that was in what I may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disappointment Within a month said missus Wilfer deepening her voice as if she were relating a terrible ghost story within a month I first saw R W my husband Within a year I married him It is natural for the mind to recall these dark coincidences on the present day mister Sampson at length released from the custody of missus Wilfer s eye now drew a long breath and made the original and striking remark that there was no accounting for these sort of presentiments R W scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before he once more hinted My dear I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself To which she once more replied On the contrary R W Quite so The wretched mister Sampson s position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable For not only was he exposed defenceless to the harangues of missus Wilfer but he received the utmost contumely at the hands of Lavinia who partly to show Bella that she Lavinia could do what she liked with him and partly to pay him off for still obviously admiring Bella s beauty led him the life of a dog Illuminated on the one hand by the stately graces of missus Wilfer s oratory and shadowed on the other by the checks and frowns of the young lady to whom he had devoted himself in his destitution the sufferings of this young gentleman were distressing to witness If his mind for the moment reeled under them it may be urged in extenuation of its weakness that it was constitutionally a knock knee d mind and never very strong upon its legs The rosy hours were thus beguiled until it was time for Bella to have Pa s escort back The dimples duly tied up in the bonnet strings and the leave taking done they got out into the air and the cherub drew a long breath as if he found it refreshing Well dear Pa said Bella the anniversary may be considered over Yes my dear returned the cherub there s another of em gone Bella drew his arm closer through hers as they walked along and gave it a number of consolatory pats Thank you my dear he said as if she had spoken I am all right my dear Well and how do you get on Bella I am not at all improved Pa Ain t you really though No Pa On the contrary I am worse Lor said the cherub I am worse Pa I make so many calculations how much a year I must have when I marry and what is the least I can manage to do with that I am beginning to get wrinkles over my nose Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening Pa Pa laughing at this Bella gave him two or three shakes You won t laugh sir when you see your lovely woman turning haggard You had better be prepared in time I can tell you I shall not be able to keep my greediness for money out of my eyes long and when you see it there you ll be sorry and serve you right for not being warned in time Now sir we entered into a bond of confidence Have you anything to impart I thought it was you who was to impart my love Oh did you indeed sir Then why didn t you ask me the moment we came out The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted However I forgive you this once and look here Pa that s Bella laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip and then laid it on her father s lip that s a kiss for you And now I am going seriously to tell you let me see how many four secrets Mind Serious grave weighty secrets Strictly between ourselves Number one my dear said her father settling her arm comfortably and confidentially Number one said Bella will electrify you Pa Who do you think has she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning has made an offer to me Pa looked in her face and looked at the ground and looked in her face again and declared he could never guess mister Rokesmith You don t tell me so my dear Mis ter Roke smith Pa said Bella separating the syllables for emphasis What do you say to THAT Pa answered quietly with the counter question What did YOU say to that my love I said No returned Bella sharply Of course Yes Of course said her father meditating And I told him why I thought it a betrayal of trust on his part and an affront to me said Bella Yes To be sure I am astonished indeed I wonder he committed himself without seeing more of his way first Now I think of it I suspect he always has admired you though my dear A hackney coachman may admire me remarked Bella with a touch of her mother s loftiness It s highly probable my love Number two my dear Number two Pa is much to the same purpose though not so preposterous mister Lightwood would propose to me if I would let him Then I understand my dear that you don t intend to let him Bella again saying with her former emphasis Why of course not her father felt himself bound to echo Of course not I don t care for him said Bella That s enough her father interposed No Pa it s NOT enough rejoined Bella giving him another shake or two Haven t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am It only becomes enough when he has no money and no clients and no expectations and no anything but debts Hah said the cherub a little depressed Number three my dear Number three Pa is a better thing A generous thing a noble thing a delightful thing missus Boffin has herself told me as a secret with her own kind lips and truer lips never opened or closed in this life I am sure that they wish to see me well married and that when I marry with their consent they will portion me most handsomely Here the grateful girl burst out crying very heartily Don t cry my darling said her father with his hand to his eyes it s excusable in me to be a little overcome when I find that my dear favourite child is after all disappointments to be so provided for and so raised in the world but don t YOU cry don t YOU cry I am very thankful I congratulate you with all my heart my dear The good soft little fellow drying his eyes here Bella put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed him on the high road passionately telling him he was the best of fathers and the best of friends and that on her wedding morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient sympathetic genial fresh young heart At every one of her adjectives she redoubled her kisses and finally kissed his hat off and then laughed immoderately when the wind took it and he ran after it When he had recovered his hat and his breath and they were going on again once more said her father then Number four my dear Bella s countenance fell in the midst of her mirth After all perhaps I had better put off number four Pa Let me try once more if for never so short a time to hope that it may not really be so The change in her strengthened the cherub s interest in number four and he said quietly May not be so my dear May not be how my dear Bella looked at him pensively and shook her head And yet I know right well it is so Pa I know it only too well My love returned her father you make me quite uncomfortable Have you said No to anybody else my dear No Pa Yes to anybody he suggested lifting up his eyebrows No Pa Is there anybody else who would take his chance between Yes and No if you would let him my dear Not that I know of Pa There can t be somebody who won t take his chance when you want him to said the cherub as a last resource Why of course not Pa said Bella giving him another shake or two No of course not he assented Bella my dear I am afraid I must either have no sleep to night or I must press for number four Oh Pa there is no good in number four I am so sorry for it I am so unwilling to believe it I have tried so earnestly not to see it that it is very hard to tell even to you But mister Boffin is being spoilt by prosperity and is changing every day My dear Bella I hope and trust not I have hoped and trusted not too Pa but every day he changes for the worse and for the worse Not to me he is always much the same to me but to others about him Before my eyes he grows suspicious capricious hard tyrannical unjust If ever a good man were ruined by good fortune it is my benefactor And yet Pa think how terrible the fascination of money is I see this and hate this and dread this and don t know but that money might make a much worse change in me And yet I have money always in my thoughts and my desires and the whole life I place before myself is money money money and what money can make of life Chapter five THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO BAD COMPANY Were Bella Wilfer s bright and ready little wits at fault or was the Golden Dustman passing through the furnace of proof and coming out dross Ill news travels fast We shall know full soon On that very night of her return from the Happy Return something chanced which Bella closely followed with her eyes and ears There was an apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion known as mister Boffin s room Far less grand than the rest of the house it was far more comfortable being pervaded by a certain air of homely snugness which upholstering despotism had banished to that spot when it inexorably set its face against mister Boffin s appeals for mercy in behalf of any other chamber Thus although a room of modest situation for its windows gave on Silas Wegg s old corner and of no pretensions to velvet satin or gilding it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing gown or pair of slippers and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening they enjoyed it as an institution that must be in mister Boffin s room mister and missus Boffin were reported sitting in this room when Bella got back Entering it she found the Secretary there too in official attendance it would appear for he was standing with some papers in his hand by a table with shaded candles on it at which mister Boffin was seated thrown back in his easy chair You are busy sir said Bella hesitating at the door Not at all my dear not at all You re one of ourselves We never make company of you Come in come in Here s the old lady in her usual place missus Boffin adding her nod and smile of welcome to mister Boffin s words Bella took her book to a chair in the fireside corner by missus Boffin s work table mister Boffin s station was on the opposite side Now Rokesmith said the Golden Dustman so sharply rapping the table to bespeak his attention as Bella turned the leaves of her book that she started where were we You were saying sir returned the Secretary with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary Don t be above calling it wages man said mister Boffin testily What the deuce I never talked of any salary when I was in service My wages said the Secretary correcting himself Rokesmith you are not proud I hope observed mister Boffin eyeing him askance I hope not sir Because I never was when I was poor said mister Boffin Poverty and pride don t go at all well together Mind that How can they go well together Why it stands to reason A man being poor has nothing to be proud of It s nonsense With a slight inclination of his head and a look of some surprise the Secretary seemed to assent by forming the syllables of the word nonsense on his lips Now concerning these same wages said mister Boffin Sit down The Secretary sat down Why didn t you sit down before asked mister Boffin distrustfully I hope that wasn t pride But about these wages Now I ve gone into the matter and I say two hundred a year What do you think of it Do you think it s enough Thank you It is a fair proposal I don t say you know mister Boffin stipulated but what it may be more than enough And I ll tell you why Rokesmith A man of property like me is bound to consider the market price At first I didn t enter into that as much as I might have done but I ve got acquainted with other men of property since and I ve got acquainted with the duties of property I mustn t go putting the market price up because money may happen not to be an object with me A sheep is worth so much in the market and I ought to give it and no more A secretary is worth so much in the market and I ought to give it and no more However I don t mind stretching a point with you mister Boffin you are very good replied the Secretary with an effort Then we put the figure said mister Boffin at two hundred a year Then the figure s disposed of Now there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year If I pay for a sheep I buy it out and out Similarly if I pay for a secretary I buy HIM out and out In other words you purchase my whole time Certainly I do Look here said mister Boffin it ain t that I want to occupy your whole time you can take up a book for a minute or two when you ve nothing better to do though I think you ll a most always find something useful to do But I want to keep you in attendance It s convenient to have you at all times ready on the premises Therefore betwixt your breakfast and your supper on the premises I expect to find you The Secretary bowed In bygone days when I was in service myself said mister Boffin I couldn t go cutting about at my will and pleasure and you won t expect to go cutting about at your will and pleasure You ve rather got into a habit of that lately but perhaps it was for want of a right specification betwixt us Now let there be a right specification betwixt us and let it be this If you want leave ask for it Again the Secretary bowed His manner was uneasy and astonished and showed a sense of humiliation I ll have a bell said mister Boffin hung from this room to yours and when I want you I ll touch it I don t call to mind that I have anything more to say at the present moment The Secretary rose gathered up his papers and withdrew Bella s eyes followed him to the door lighted on mister Boffin complacently thrown back in his easy chair and drooped over her book I have let that chap that young man of mine said mister Boffin taking a trot up and down the room get above his work It won t do I must have him down a peg A man of property owes a duty to other men of property and must look sharp after his inferiors Bella felt that missus Boffin was not comfortable and that the eyes of that good creature sought to discover from her face what attention she had given to this discourse and what impression it had made upon her For which reason Bella s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book and she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it Noddy said missus Boffin after thoughtfully pausing in her work My dear returned the Golden Dustman stopping short in his trot Excuse my putting it to you Noddy but now really Haven t you been a little strict with mister Rokesmith to night Haven t you been a little just a little little not quite like your old self Why old woman I hope so returned mister Boffin cheerfully if not boastfully Hope so deary Our old selves wouldn t do here old lady Haven t you found that out yet Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon Our old selves weren t people of fortune our new selves are it s a great difference Ah said missus Boffin pausing in her work again softly to draw a long breath and to look at the fire A great difference And we must be up to the difference pursued her husband we must be equal to the change that s what we must be We ve got to hold our own now against everybody for everybody s hand is stretched out to be dipped into our pockets and we have got to recollect that money makes money as well as makes everything else Mentioning recollecting said missus Boffin with her work abandoned her eyes upon the fire and her chin upon her hand do you recollect Noddy how you said to mister Rokesmith when he first came to see us at the Bower and you engaged him how you said to him that if it had pleased Heaven to send John Harmon to his fortune safe we could have been content with the one Mound which was our legacy and should never have wanted the rest Ay I remember old lady But we hadn t tried what it was to have the rest then Our new shoes had come home but we hadn t put em on We re wearing em now we re wearing em and must step out accordingly missus Boffin took up her work again and plied her needle in silence As to Rokesmith that young man of mine said mister Boffin dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there it s the same with him as with the footmen I have found out that you must either scrunch them or let them scrunch you If you ain t imperious with em they won t believe in your being any better than themselves if as good after the stories lies mostly that they have heard of your beginnings There s nothing betwixt stiffening yourself up and throwing yourself away take my word for that old lady Bella ventured for a moment to look stealthily towards him under her eyelashes and she saw a dark cloud of suspicion covetousness and conceit overshadowing the once open face Hows ever said he this isn t entertaining to Miss Bella Is it Bella A deceiving Bella she was to look at him with that pensively abstracted air as if her mind were full of her book and she had not heard a single word Hah Better employed than to attend to it said mister Boffin That s right that s right Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself my dear Colouring a little under this compliment Bella returned I hope sir you don t think me vain Not a bit my dear said mister Boffin But I think it s very creditable in you at your age to be so well up with the pace of the world and to know what to go in for You are right Go in for money my love Money s the article You ll make money of your good looks and of the money missus Boffin and me will have the pleasure of settling upon you and you ll live and die rich That s the state to live and die in said mister Boffin in an unctuous manner R r rich There was an expression of distress in missus Boffin s face as after watching her husband s she turned to their adopted girl and said Don t mind him Bella my dear Eh cried mister Boffin What Not mind him I don t mean that said missus Boffin with a worried look but I mean don t believe him to be anything but good and generous Bella because he is the best of men No I must say that much Noddy You are always the best of men She made the declaration as if he were objecting to it which assuredly he was not in any way And as to you my dear Bella said missus Boffin still with that distressed expression he is so much attached to you whatever he says that your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like you better than he does Says too cried mister Boffin Whatever he says Why I say so openly Give me a kiss my dear child in saying Good Night and let me confirm what my old lady tells you I am very fond of you my dear and I am entirely of your mind and you and I will take care that you shall be rich These good looks of yours which you have some right to be vain of my dear though you are not you know are worth money and you shall make money of em The money you will have will be worth money and you shall make money of that too There s a golden ball at your feet Good night my dear Somehow Bella was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been Somehow when she put her arms round missus Boffin s neck and said Good Night she derived a sense of unworthiness from the still anxious face of that good woman and her obvious wish to excuse her husband Why what need to excuse him thought Bella sitting down in her own room What he said was very sensible I am sure and very true I am sure It is only what I often say to myself Don t I like it then No I don t like it and though he is my liberal benefactor I disparage him for it Then pray said Bella sternly putting the question to herself in the looking glass as usual what do you mean by this you inconsistent little Beast The looking glass preserving a discreet ministerial silence when thus called upon for explanation Bella went to bed with a weariness upon her spirit which was more than the weariness of want of sleep And again in the morning she looked for the cloud and for the deepening of the cloud upon the Golden Dustman s face She had begun by this time to be his frequent companion in his morning strolls about the streets and it was at this time that he made her a party to his engaging in a curious pursuit Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life he had a child s delight in looking at shops It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom and was equally the delight of his wife For many years their only walks in London had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut and when every day in the week became their holiday they derived an enjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the windows which seemed incapable of exhaustion As if the principal streets were a great Theatre and the play were childishly new to them mister and missus Boffin from the beginning of Bella s intimacy in their house had been constantly in the front row charmed with all they saw and applauding vigorously But now mister Boffin s interest began to centre in book shops and more than that for that of itself would not have been much in one exceptional kind of book Look in here my dear mister Boffin would say checking Bella s arm at a bookseller s window you can read at sight and your eyes are as sharp as they re bright Now look well about you my dear and tell me if you see any book about a Miser If Bella saw such a book mister Boffin would instantly dart in and buy it And still as if they had not found it they would seek out another book shop and mister Boffin would say Now look well all round my dear for a Life of a Miser or any book of that sort any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers Bella thus directed would examine the window with the greatest attention while mister Boffin would examine her face The moment she pointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages Anecdotes of strange characters Records of remarkable individuals or anything to that purpose mister Boffin s countenance would light up and he would instantly dart in and buy it Size price quality were of no account Any book that seemed to promise a chance of miserly biography mister Boffin purchased without a moment s delay and carried home Happening to be informed by a bookseller that a portion of the Annual Register was devoted to Characters mister Boffin at once bought a whole set of that ingenious compilation and began to carry it home piecemeal confiding a volume to Bella and bearing three himself The completion of this labour occupied them about a fortnight When the task was done mister Boffin with his appetite for Misers whetted instead of satiated began to look out again It very soon became unnecessary to tell Bella what to look for and an understanding was established between her and mister Boffin that she was always to look for Lives of Misers Morning after morning they roamed about the town together pursuing this singular research Miserly literature not being abundant the proportion of failures to successes may have been as a hundred to one still mister Boffin never wearied remained as avaricious for misers as he had been at the first onset It was curious that Bella never saw the books about the house nor did she ever hear from mister Boffin one word of reference to their contents He seemed to save up his Misers as they had saved up their money As they had been greedy for it and secret about it and had hidden it so he was greedy for them and secret about them and hid them But beyond all doubt it was to be noticed and was by Bella very clearly noticed that as he pursued the acquisition of those dismal records with the ardour of Don Quixote for his books of chivalry he began to spend his money with a more sparing hand And often when he came out of a shop with some new account of one of those wretched lunatics she would almost shrink from the sly dry chuckle with which he would take her arm again and trot away It did not appear that missus Boffin knew of this taste He made no allusion to it except in the morning walks when he and Bella were always alone and Bella partly under the impression that he took her into his confidence by implication and partly in remembrance of missus Boffin s anxious face that night held the same reserve While these occurrences were in progress missus Lammle made the discovery that Bella had a fascinating influence over her The Lammles originally presented by the dear Veneerings visited the Boffins on all grand occasions and missus Lammle had not previously found this out but now the knowledge came upon her all at once It was a most extraordinary thing she said to missus Boffin she was foolishly susceptible of the power of beauty but it wasn t altogether that she never had been able to resist a natural grace of manner but it wasn t altogether that it was more than that and there was no name for the indescribable extent and degree to which she was captivated by this charming girl This charming girl having the words repeated to her by missus Boffin who was proud of her being admired and would have done anything to give her pleasure naturally recognized in missus Lammle a woman of penetration and taste Responding to the sentiments by being very gracious to missus Lammle she gave that lady the means of so improving her opportunity as that the captivation became reciprocal though always wearing an appearance of greater sobriety on Bella s part than on the enthusiastic Sophronia s Howbeit they were so much together that for a time the Boffin chariot held missus Lammle oftener than missus Boffin a preference of which the latter worthy soul was not in the least jealous placidly remarking missus Lammle is a younger companion for her than I am and Lor she s more fashionable But between Bella Wilfer and Georgiana Podsnap there was this one difference among many others that Bella was in no danger of being captivated by Alfred She distrusted and disliked him Indeed her perception was so quick and her observation so sharp that after all she mistrusted his wife too though with her giddy vanity and wilfulness she squeezed the mistrust away into a corner of her mind and blocked it up there missus Lammle took the friendliest interest in Bella s making a good match missus Lammle said in a sportive way she really must show her beautiful Bella what kind of wealthy creatures she and Alfred had on hand who would as one man fall at her feet enslaved Fitting occasion made missus Lammle accordingly produced the most passable of those feverish boastful and indefinably loose gentlemen who were always lounging in and out of the City on questions of the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths Who in their agreeable manner did homage to Bella as if she were a compound of fine girl thorough bred horse well built drag and remarkable pipe But without the least effect though even mister Fledgeby s attractions were cast into the scale I fear Bella dear said missus Lammle one day in the chariot that you will be very hard to please I don t expect to be pleased dear said Bella with a languid turn of her eyes Truly my love returned Sophronia shaking her head and smiling her best smile it would not be very easy to find a man worthy of your attractions The question is not a man my dear said Bella coolly but an establishment My love returned missus Lammle your prudence amazes me where DID you study life so well you are right In such a case as yours the object is a fitting establishment You could not descend to an inadequate one from mister Boffin s house and even if your beauty alone could not command it it is to be assumed that mister and missus Boffin will Oh they have already Bella interposed No Have they really A little vexed by a suspicion that she had spoken precipitately and withal a little defiant of her own vexation Bella determined not to retreat That is to say she explained they have told me they mean to portion me as their adopted child if you mean that But don t mention it Mention it replied missus Lammle as if she were full of awakened feeling at the suggestion of such an impossibility Men tion it I don t mind telling you missus Lammle Bella began again My love say Sophronia or I must not say Bella With a little short petulant Oh Bella complied Oh Sophronia then I don t mind telling you Sophronia that I am convinced I have no heart as people call it and that I think that sort of thing is nonsense Brave girl murmured missus Lammle And so pursued Bella as to seeking to please myself I don t except in the one respect I have mentioned I am indifferent otherwise But you can t help pleasing Bella said missus Lammle rallying her with an arch look and her best smile you can t help making a proud and an admiring husband You may not care to please yourself and you may not care to please him but you are not a free agent as to pleasing you are forced to do that in spite of yourself my dear so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too if you can Now the very grossness of this flattery put Bella upon proving that she actually did please in spite of herself She had a misgiving that she was doing wrong though she had an indistinct foreshadowing that some harm might come of it thereafter she little thought what consequences it would really bring about but she went on with her confidence Don t talk of pleasing in spite of one s self dear said Bella I have had enough of that Ay cried missus Lammle Am I already corroborated Bella Never mind Sophronia we will not speak of it any more Don t ask me about it This plainly meaning Do ask me about it missus Lammle did as she was requested Tell me Bella Come my dear What provoking burr has been inconveniently attracted to the charming skirts and with difficulty shaken off Provoking indeed said Bella and no burr to boast of But don t ask me Shall I guess You would never guess What would you say to our Secretary My dear The hermit Secretary who creeps up and down the back stairs and is never seen I don t know about his creeping up and down the back stairs said Bella rather contemptuously further than knowing that he does no such thing and as to his never being seen I should be content never to have seen him though he is quite as visible as you are But I pleased HIM for my sins and he had the presumption to tell me so The man never made a declaration to you my dear Bella Are you sure of that Sophronia said Bella I am not In fact I am sure of the contrary The man must be mad said missus Lammle with a kind of resignation He appeared to be in his senses returned Bella tossing her head and he had plenty to say for himself I told him my opinion of his declaration and his conduct and dismissed him Of course this has all been very inconvenient to me and very disagreeable It has remained a secret however That word reminds me to observe Sophronia that I have glided on into telling you the secret and that I rely upon you never to mention it Mention it repeated missus Lammle with her former feeling Men tion it This time Sophronia was so much in earnest that she found it necessary to bend forward in the carriage and give Bella a kiss A Judas order of kiss for she thought while she yet pressed Bella s hand after giving it Upon your own showing you vain heartless girl puffed up by the doting folly of a dustman I need have no relenting towards YOU If my husband who sends me here should form any schemes for making YOU a victim I should certainly not cross him again In those very same moments Bella was thinking Why am I always at war with myself Why have I told as if upon compulsion what I knew all along I ought to have withheld Why am I making a friend of this woman beside me in spite of the whispers against her that I hear in my heart As usual there was no answer in the looking glass when she got home and referred these questions to it Perhaps if she had consulted some better oracle the result might have been more satisfactory but she did not and all things consequent marched the march before them On one point connected with the watch she kept on mister Boffin she felt very inquisitive and that was the question whether the Secretary watched him too and followed the sure and steady change in him as she did Her very limited intercourse with mister Rokesmith rendered this hard to find out Their communication now at no time extended beyond the preservation of commonplace appearances before mister and missus Boffin and if Bella and the Secretary were ever left alone together by any chance he immediately withdrew She consulted his face when she could do so covertly as she worked or read and could make nothing of it He looked subdued but he had acquired a strong command of feature and whenever mister Boffin spoke to him in Bella s presence or whatever revelation of himself mister Boffin made the Secretary s face changed no more than a wall A slightly knitted brow that expressed nothing but an almost mechanical attention and a compression of the mouth that might have been a guard against a scornful smile these she saw from morning to night from day to day from week to week monotonous unvarying set as in a piece of sculpture The worst of the matter was that it thus fell out insensibly and most provokingly as Bella complained to herself in her impetuous little manner that her observation of mister Boffin involved a continual observation of mister Rokesmith Won t THAT extract a look from him Can it be possible THAT makes no impression on him Such questions Bella would propose to herself often as many times in a day as there were hours in it Impossible to know Always the same fixed face Can he be so base as to sell his very nature for two hundred a year Bella would think And then But why not It s a mere question of price with others besides him I suppose I would sell mine if I could get enough for it And so she would come round again to the war with herself A kind of illegibility though a different kind stole over mister Boffin s face Its old simplicity of expression got masked by a certain craftiness that assimilated even his good humour to itself His very smile was cunning as if he had been studying smiles among the portraits of his misers Saving an occasional burst of impatience or coarse assertion of his mastery his good humour remained to him but it had now a sordid alloy of distrust and though his eyes should twinkle and all his face should laugh he would sit holding himself in his own arms as if he had an inclination to hoard himself up and must always grudgingly stand on the defensive What with taking heed of these two faces and what with feeling conscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own Bella soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face among them all but missus Boffin s None the less because it was far less radiant than of yore faithfully reflecting in its anxiety and regret every line of change in the Golden Dustman s Rokesmith said mister Boffin one evening when they were all in his room again and he and the Secretary had been going over some accounts I am spending too much money Or leastways you are spending too much for me You are rich sir I am not said mister Boffin The sharpness of the retort was next to telling the Secretary that he lied But it brought no change of expression into the set face I tell you I am not rich repeated mister Boffin and I won t have it You are not rich sir repeated the Secretary in measured words Well returned mister Boffin if I am that s my business I am not going to spend at this rate to please you or anybody You wouldn t like it if it was your money Even in that impossible case sir I Hold your tongue said mister Boffin You oughtn t to like it in any case There I didn t mean to be rude but you put me out so and after all I m master I didn t intend to tell you to hold your tongue I beg your pardon Don t hold your tongue Only don t contradict Did you ever come across the life of mister Elwes referring to his favourite subject at last The miser Ah people called him a miser People are always calling other people something Did you ever read about him I think so He never owned to being rich and yet he might have bought me twice over Did you ever hear of Daniel Dancer Another miser Yes He was a good un said mister Boffin and he had a sister worthy of him They never called themselves rich neither If they HAD called themselves rich most likely they wouldn t have been so They lived and died very miserably Did they not sir No I don t know that they did said mister Boffin curtly Then they are not the Misers I mean Those abject wretches Don t call names Rokesmith said mister Boffin That exemplary brother and sister lived and died in the foulest and filthiest degradation They pleased themselves said mister Boffin and I suppose they could have done no more if they had spent their money But however I ain t going to fling mine away Keep the expenses down The fact is you ain t enough here Rokesmith It wants constant attention in the littlest things Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next As the persons you have cited quietly remarked the Secretary thought they would if I remember sir And very creditable in em too said mister Boffin Very independent in em But never mind them just now Have you given notice to quit your lodgings Under your direction I have sir Then I tell you what said mister Boffin pay the quarter s rent pay the quarter s rent it ll be the cheapest thing in the end and come here at once so that you may be always on the spot day and night and keep the expenses down You ll charge the quarter s rent to me and we must try and save it somewhere You ve got some lovely furniture haven t you The furniture in my rooms is my own Then we shan t have to buy any for you In case you was to think it said mister Boffin with a look of peculiar shrewdness so honourably independent in you as to make it a relief to your mind to make that furniture over to me in the light of a set off against the quarter s rent why ease your mind ease your mind I don t ask it but I won t stand in your way if you should consider it due to yourself As to your room choose any empty room at the top of the house Any empty room will do for me said the Secretary You can take your pick said mister Boffin and it ll be as good as eight or ten shillings a week added to your income I won t deduct for it I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down Now if you ll show a light I ll come to your office room and dispose of a letter or two On that clear generous face of missus Boffin s Bella had seen such traces of a pang at the heart while this dialogue was being held that she had not the courage to turn her eyes to it when they were left alone Feigning to be intent on her embroidery she sat plying her needle until her busy hand was stopped by missus Boffin s hand being lightly laid upon it Yielding to the touch she felt her hand carried to the good soul s lips and felt a tear fall on it Oh my loved husband said missus Boffin This is hard to see and hear But my dear Bella believe me that in spite of all the change in him he is the best of men He came back at the moment when Bella had taken the hand comfortingly between her own Eh said he mistrustfully looking in at the door What s she telling you She is only praising you sir said Bella Praising me You are sure Not blaming me for standing on my own defence against a crew of plunderers who could suck me dry by driblets Not blaming me for getting a little hoard together He came up to them and his wife folded her hands upon his shoulder and shook her head as she laid it on her hands There there there urged mister Boffin not unkindly Don t take on old lady But I can t bear to see you so my dear Nonsense Recollect we are not our old selves Recollect we must scrunch or be scrunched Recollect we must hold our own Recollect money makes money Don t you be uneasy Bella my child don t you be doubtful The more I save the more you shall have Bella thought it was well for his wife that she was musing with her affectionate face on his shoulder for there was a cunning light in his eyes as he said all this which seemed to cast a disagreeable illumination on the change in him and make it morally uglier Chapter six THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO WORSE COMPANY It had come to pass that mister Silas Wegg now rarely attended the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour at his the worm s and minion s own house but lay under general instructions to await him within a certain margin of hours at the Bower mister Wegg took this arrangement in great dudgeon because the appointed hours were evening hours and those he considered precious to the progress of the friendly move But it was quite in character he bitterly remarked to mister Venus that the upstart who had trampled on those eminent creatures Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane and Uncle Parker should oppress his literary man The Roman Empire having worked out its destruction mister Boffin next appeared in a cab with Rollin s Ancient History which valuable work being found to possess lethargic properties broke down at about the period when the whole of the army of Alexander the Macedonian at that time about forty thousand strong burst into tears simultaneously on his being taken with a shivering fit after bathing The Wars of the Jews likewise languishing under mister Wegg s generalship mister Boffin arrived in another cab with Plutarch whose Lives he found in the sequel extremely entertaining though he hoped Plutarch might not expect him to believe them all What to believe in the course of his reading was mister Boffin s chief literary difficulty indeed for some time he was divided in his mind between half all or none at length when he decided as a moderate man to compound with half the question still remained which half And that stumbling block he never got over One evening when Silas Wegg had grown accustomed to the arrival of his patron in a cab accompanied by some profane historian charged with unutterable names of incomprehensible peoples of impossible descent waging wars any number of years and syllables long and carrying illimitable hosts and riches about with the greatest ease beyond the confines of geography one evening the usual time passed by and no patron appeared After half an hour s grace mister Wegg proceeded to the outer gate and there executed a whistle conveying to mister Venus if perchance within hearing the tidings of his being at home and disengaged Forth from the shelter of a neighbouring wall mister Venus then emerged Brother in arms said mister Wegg in excellent spirits welcome In return mister Venus gave him a rather dry good evening Walk in brother said Silas clapping him on the shoulder and take your seat in my chimley corner for what says the ballad No malice to dread sir And no falsehood to fear But truth to delight me mister Venus And I forgot what to cheer Li toddle de om dee And something to guide My ain fireside sir My ain fireside With this quotation depending for its neatness rather on the spirit than the words mister Wegg conducted his guest to his hearth And you come brother said mister Wegg in a hospitable glow you come like I don t know what exactly like it I shouldn t know you from it shedding a halo all around you What kind of halo asked mister Venus Ope sir replied Silas That s YOUR halo mister Venus appeared doubtful on the point and looked rather discontentedly at the fire We ll devote the evening brother exclaimed Wegg to prosecute our friendly move And arterwards crushing a flowing wine cup which I allude to brewing rum and water we ll pledge one another For what says the Poet And you needn t mister Venus be your black bottle For surely I ll be mine And we ll take a glass with a slice of lemon in it to which you re partial For auld lang syne This flow of quotation and hospitality in Wegg indicated his observation of some little querulousness on the part of Venus Why as to the friendly move observed the last named gentleman rubbing his knees peevishly one of my objections to it is that it DON T move Rome brother returned Wegg a city which it may not be generally known originated in twins and a wolf and ended in Imperial marble wasn t built in a day Did I say it was asked Venus No you did not brother Well inquired But I do say proceeded Venus that I am taken from among my trophies of anatomy am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere coal ashes warious and nothing comes of it I think I must give up No sir remonstrated Wegg enthusiastically No Sir Charge Chester charge On mister Venus on Never say die sir A man of your mark It s not so much saying it that I object to returned mister Venus as doing it And having got to do it whether or no I can t afford to waste my time on groping for nothing in cinders But think how little time you have given to the move sir after all urged Wegg Add the evenings so occupied together and what do they come to And you sir harmonizer with myself in opinions views and feelings you with the patience to fit together on wires the whole framework of society I allude to the human skelinton you to give in so soon I don t like it returned mister Venus moodily as he put his head between his knees and stuck up his dusty hair And there s no encouragement to go on Not them Mounds without said mister Wegg extending his right hand with an air of solemn reasoning encouragement Not them Mounds now looking down upon us They re too big grumbled Venus What s a scratch here and a scrape there a poke in this place and a dig in the other to them Besides what have we found What HAVE we found cried Wegg delighted to be able to acquiesce Ah There I grant you comrade Nothing But on the contrary comrade what MAY we find There you ll grant me Anything I don t like it pettishly returned Venus as before I came into it without enough consideration And besides again Isn t your own mister Boffin well acquainted with the Mounds And wasn t he well acquainted with the deceased and his ways And has he ever showed any expectation of finding anything At that moment wheels were heard Now I should be loth said mister Wegg with an air of patient injury to think so ill of him as to suppose him capable of coming at this time of night And yet it sounds like him A ring at the yard bell It is him said mister Wegg and he is capable of it I am sorry because I could have wished to keep up a little lingering fragment of respect for him Here mister Boffin was heard lustily calling at the yard gate Halloa Wegg Halloa Keep your seat mister Venus said Wegg He may not stop And then called out Halloa sir Halloa I m with you directly sir Half a minute mister Boffin Coming sir as fast as my leg will bring me And so with a show of much cheerful alacrity stumped out to the gate with a light and there through the window of a cab descried mister Boffin inside blocked up with books Here lend a hand Wegg said mister Boffin excitedly I can t get out till the way is cleared for me This is the Annual Register Wegg in a cab full of wollumes Do you know him Know the Animal Register sir returned the Impostor who had caught the name imperfectly For a trifling wager I think I could find any Animal in him blindfold mister Boffin And here s Kirby s Wonderful Museum said mister Boffin and Caulfield s Characters and Wilson s Such Characters Wegg such Characters I must have one or two of the best of em to night It s amazing what places they used to put the guineas in wrapped up in rags Catch hold of that pile of wollumes Wegg or it ll bulge out and burst into the mud Is there anyone about to help There s a friend of mine sir that had the intention of spending the evening with me when I gave you up much against my will for the night Call him out cried mister Boffin in a bustle get him to bear a hand Don t drop that one under your arm It s Dancer Him and his sister made pies of a dead sheep they found when they were out a walking Where s your friend Oh here s your friend Would you be so good as help Wegg and myself with these books But don t take Jemmy Taylor of Southwark nor yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester These are the two Jemmys I ll carry them myself Not ceasing to talk and bustle in a state of great excitement mister Boffin directed the removal and arrangement of the books appearing to be in some sort beside himself until they were all deposited on the floor and the cab was dismissed There said mister Boffin gloating over them There they are like the four and twenty fiddlers all of a row Get on your spectacles Wegg I know where to find the best of em and we ll have a taste at once of what we have got before us What s your friend s name mister Wegg presented his friend as mister Venus Eh cried mister Boffin catching at the name Of Clerkenwell Of Clerkenwell sir said mister Venus Why I ve heard of you cried mister Boffin I heard of you in the old man s time You knew him Did you ever buy anything of him With piercing eagerness No sir returned Venus But he showed you things didn t he mister Venus with a glance at his friend replied in the affirmative What did he show you asked mister Boffin putting his hands behind him and eagerly advancing his head Did he show you boxes little cabinets pocket books parcels anything locked or sealed anything tied up mister Venus shook his head Are you a judge of china mister Venus again shook his head Because if he had ever showed you a teapot I should be glad to know of it said mister Boffin And then with his right hand at his lips repeated thoughtfully a Teapot a Teapot and glanced over the books on the floor as if he knew there was something interesting connected with a teapot somewhere among them mister Wegg and mister Venus looked at one another wonderingly and mister Wegg in fitting on his spectacles opened his eyes wide over their rims and tapped the side of his nose as an admonition to Venus to keep himself generally wide awake A Teapot repeated mister Boffin continuing to muse and survey the books a Teapot a Teapot Are you ready Wegg I am at your service sir replied that gentleman taking his usual seat on the usual settle and poking his wooden leg under the table before it mister Venus would you make yourself useful and take a seat beside me sir for the conveniency of snuffing the candles Venus complying with the invitation while it was yet being given Silas pegged at him with his wooden leg to call his particular attention to mister Boffin standing musing before the fire in the space between the two settles Hem Ahem coughed mister Wegg to attract his employer s attention Would you wish to commence with an Animal sir from the Register No said mister Boffin no Wegg With that producing a little book from his breast pocket he handed it with great care to the literary gentlemen and inquired What do you call that Wegg This sir replied Silas adjusting his spectacles and referring to the title page is Merryweather s Lives and Anecdotes of Misers mister Venus would you make yourself useful and draw the candles a little nearer sir This to have a special opportunity of bestowing a stare upon his comrade Which of em have you got in that lot asked mister Boffin Can you find out pretty easy Well sir replied Silas turning to the table of contents and slowly fluttering the leaves of the book I should say they must be pretty well all here sir here s a large assortment sir my eye catches John Overs sir John Little sir Dick Jarrel John Elwes the Reverend mister Jones of Blewbury Vulture Hopkins Daniel Dancer Give us Dancer Wegg said mister Boffin With another stare at his comrade Silas sought and found the place Page a hundred and nine mister Boffin Chapter eight Contents of chapter His birth and estate His garments and outward appearance Miss Dancer and her feminine graces The Miser s Mansion The finding of a treasure The Story of the Mutton Pies A Miser s Idea of Death Bob the Miser s cur Griffiths and his Master How to turn a penny A substitute for a Fire The Advantages of keeping a Snuff box The Miser dies without a Shirt The Treasures of a Dunghill Eh What s that demanded mister Boffin The Treasures sir repeated Silas reading very distinctly of a Dunghill mister Venus sir would you obleege with the snuffers This to secure attention to his adding with his lips only Mounds mister Boffin drew an arm chair into the space where he stood and said seating himself and slyly rubbing his hands Give us Dancer mister Wegg pursued the biography of that eminent man through its various phases of avarice and dirt through Miss Dancer s death on a sick regimen of cold dumpling and through mister Dancer s keeping his rags together with a hayband and warming his dinner by sitting upon it down to the consolatory incident of his dying naked in a sack After which he read on as follows The house or rather the heap of ruins in which mister Dancer lived and which at his death devolved to the right of Captain Holmes was a most miserable decayed building for it had not been repaired for more than half a century Here mister Wegg eyes his comrade and the room in which they sat which had not been repaired for a long time But though poor in external structure the ruinous fabric was very rich in the interior It took many weeks to explore its whole contents and Captain Holmes found it a very agreeable task to dive into the miser s secret hoards Here mister Wegg repeated secret hoards and pegged his comrade again One of mister Dancer s richest escretoires was found to be a dungheap in the cowhouse a sum but little short of two thousand five hundred pounds was contained in this rich piece of manure and in an old jacket carefully tied and strongly nailed down to the manger in bank notes and gold were found five hundred pounds more Here mister Wegg s wooden leg started forward under the table and slowly elevated itself as he read on Several bowls were discovered filled with guineas and half guineas and at different times on searching the corners of the house they found various parcels of bank notes Some were crammed into the crevices of the wall Here mister Venus looked at the wall Bundles were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs Here mister Venus looked under himself on the settle Some were reposing snugly at the back of the drawers and notes amounting to six hundred pounds were found neatly doubled up in the inside of an old teapot In the stable the Captain found jugs full of old dollars and shillings The chimney was not left unsearched and paid very well for the trouble for in nineteen different holes all filled with soot were found various sums of money amounting together to more than two hundred pounds On the way to this crisis mister Wegg s wooden leg had gradually elevated itself more and more and he had nudged mister Venus with his opposite elbow deeper and deeper until at length the preservation of his balance became incompatible with the two actions and he now dropped over sideways upon that gentleman squeezing him against the settle s edge Nor did either of the two for some few seconds make any effort to recover himself both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon But the sight of mister Boffin sitting in the arm chair hugging himself with his eyes upon the fire acted as a restorative Counterfeiting a sneeze to cover their movements mister Wegg with a spasmodic Tish ho pulled himself and mister Venus up in a masterly manner Let s have some more said mister Boffin hungrily John Elwes is the next sir Is it your pleasure to take John Elwes Ah said mister Boffin Let s hear what John did He did not appear to have hidden anything so went off rather flatly But an exemplary lady named Wilcocks who had stowed away gold and silver in a pickle pot in a clock case a canister full of treasure in a hole under her stairs and a quantity of money in an old rat trap revived the interest To her succeeded another lady claiming to be a pauper whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag To her another lady apple woman by trade who had saved a fortune of ten thousand pounds and hidden it here and there in cracks and corners behind bricks and under the flooring To her a French gentleman who had crammed up his chimney rather to the detriment of its drawing powers a leather valise containing twenty thousand francs gold coins and a large quantity of precious stones as discovered by a chimneysweep after his death By these steps mister Wegg arrived at a concluding instance of the human Magpie Many years ago there lived at Cambridge a miserly old couple of the name of Jardine they had two sons the father was a perfect miser and at his death one thousand guineas were discovered secreted in his bed The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire When about twenty years of age they commenced business at Cambridge as drapers and they continued there until their death The establishment of the Messrs Jardine was the most dirty of all the shops in Cambridge Customers seldom went in to purchase except perhaps out of curiosity The brothers were most disreputable looking beings for although surrounded with gay apparel as their staple in trade they wore the most filthy rags themselves It is said that they had no bed and to save the expense of one always slept on a bundle of packing cloths under the counter In their housekeeping they were penurious in the extreme A joint of meat did not grace their board for twenty years Yet when the first of the brothers died the other much to his surprise found large sums of money which had been secreted even from him There cried mister Boffin Even from him you see There was only two of em and yet one of em hid from the other mister Venus who since his introduction to the French gentleman had been stooping to peer up the chimney had his attention recalled by the last sentence and took the liberty of repeating it Do you like it asked mister Boffin turning suddenly I beg your pardon sir Do you like what Wegg s been a reading mister Venus answered that he found it extremely interesting Then come again said mister Boffin and hear some more Come when you like come the day after to morrow half an hour sooner There s plenty more there s no end to it mister Venus expressed his acknowledgments and accepted the invitation It s wonderful what s been hid at one time and another said mister Boffin ruminating truly wonderful Meaning sir observed Wegg with a propitiatory face to draw him out and with another peg at his friend and brother in the way of money Money said mister Boffin Ah And papers mister Wegg in a languid transport again dropped over on mister Venus and again recovering himself masked his emotions with a sneeze Tish ho Did you say papers too sir Been hidden sir Hidden and forgot said mister Boffin Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum where s the Wonderful Museum He was on his knees on the floor in a moment groping eagerly among the books Can I assist you sir asked Wegg No I have got it here it is said mister Boffin dusting it with the sleeve of his coat Wollume four I know it was the fourth wollume that the bookseller read it to me out of Look for it Wegg Silas took the book and turned the leaves Remarkable petrefaction sir No that s not it said mister Boffin It can t have been a petrefaction Memoirs of General John Reid commonly called The Walking Rushlight sir With portrait No nor yet him said mister Boffin Remarkable case of a person who swallowed a crown piece sir To hide it asked mister Boffin Why no sir replied Wegg consulting the text it appears to have been done by accident Oh This next must be it Singular discovery of a will lost twenty one years That s it cried mister Boffin Read that A most extraordinary case read Silas Wegg aloud was tried at the last Maryborough assizes in Ireland It was briefly this Robert Baldwin in March seventeen eighty two made his will in which he devised the lands now in question to the children of his youngest son soon after which his faculties failed him and he became altogether childish and died above eighty years old The defendant the eldest son immediately afterwards gave out that his father had destroyed the will and no will being found he entered into possession of the lands in question and so matters remained for twenty one years the whole family during all that time believing that the father had died without a will But after twenty one years the defendant s wife died and he very soon afterwards at the age of seventy eight married a very young woman which caused some anxiety to his two sons whose poignant expressions of this feeling so exasperated their father that he in his resentment executed a will to disinherit his eldest son and in his fit of anger showed it to his second son who instantly determined to get at it and destroy it in order to preserve the property to his brother With this view he broke open his father s desk where he found not his father s will which he sought after but the will of his grandfather which was then altogether forgotten in the family There said mister Boffin See what men put away and forget or mean to destroy and don t He then added in a slow tone As ton ish ing And as he rolled his eyes all round the room Wegg and Venus likewise rolled their eyes all round the room And then Wegg singly fixed his eyes on mister Boffin looking at the fire again as if he had a mind to spring upon him and demand his thoughts or his life However time s up for to night said mister Boffin waving his hand after a silence More the day after to morrow Range the books upon the shelves Wegg I dare say mister Venus will be so kind as help you While speaking he thrust his hand into the breast of his outer coat and struggled with some object there that was too large to be got out easily What was the stupefaction of the friendly movers when this object at last emerging proved to be a much dilapidated dark lantern Without at all noticing the effect produced by this little instrument mister Boffin stood it on his knee and producing a box of matches deliberately lighted the candle in the lantern blew out the kindled match and cast the end into the fire I m going Wegg he then announced to take a turn about the place and round the yard I don t want you Me and this same lantern have taken hundreds thousands of such turns in our time together But I couldn t think sir not on any account I couldn t Wegg was politely beginning when mister Boffin who had risen and was going towards the door stopped I have told you that I don t want you Wegg Wegg looked intelligently thoughtful as if that had not occurred to his mind until he now brought it to bear on the circumstance He had nothing for it but to let mister Boffin go out and shut the door behind him But the instant he was on the other side of it Wegg clutched Venus with both hands and said in a choking whisper as if he were being strangled mister Venus he must be followed he must be watched he mustn t be lost sight of for a moment Why mustn t he asked Venus also strangling Comrade you might have noticed I was a little elewated in spirits when you come in to night I ve found something What have you found asked Venus clutching him with both hands so that they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators There s no time to tell you now I think he must have gone to look for it We must have an eye upon him instantly Releasing each other they crept to the door opened it softly and peeped out It was a cloudy night and the black shadow of the Mounds made the dark yard darker If not a double swindler whispered Wegg why a dark lantern We could have seen what he was about if he had carried a light one Softly this way Cautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set in ashes the two stole after him They could hear him at his peculiar trot crushing the loose cinders as he went He knows the place by heart muttered Silas and don t need to turn his lantern on confound him But he did turn it on almost in that same instant and flashed its light upon the first of the Mounds Is that the spot asked Venus in a whisper He s warm said Silas in the same tone He s precious warm He s close I think he must be going to look for it What s that he s got in his hand A shovel answered Venus And he knows how to use it remember fifty times as well as either of us If he looks for it and misses it partner suggested Wegg what shall we do First of all wait till he does said Venus Discreet advice too for he darkened his lantern again and the mound turned black After a few seconds he turned the light on once more and was seen standing at the foot of the second mound slowly raising the lantern little by little until he held it up at arm s length as if he were examining the condition of the whole surface That can t be the spot too said Venus No said Wegg he s getting cold It strikes me whispered Venus that he wants to find out whether any one has been groping about there Hush returned Wegg he s getting colder and colder Now he s freezing This exclamation was elicited by his having turned the lantern off again and on again and being visible at the foot of the third mound Why he s going up it said Venus Shovel and all said Wegg At a nimbler trot as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by reviving old associations mister Boffin ascended the serpentining walk up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of their beginning to decline and fall On striking into it he turned his lantern off The two followed him stooping low so that their figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his lantern on again mister Venus took the lead towing mister Wegg in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself They could just make out that the Golden Dustman stopped to breathe Of course they stopped too instantly This is his own Mound whispered Wegg as he recovered his wind this one Why all three are his own returned Venus So he thinks but he s used to call this his own because it s the one first left to him the one that was his legacy when it was all he took under the will When he shows his light said Venus keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time drop lower and keep closer He went on again and they followed again Gaining the top of the Mound he turned on his light but only partially and stood it on the ground A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there and had been there many a year Hard by this pole his lantern stood lighting a few feet of the lower part of it and a little of the ashy surface around and then casting off a purposeless little clear trail of light into the air He can never be going to dig up the pole whispered Venus as they dropped low and kept close Perhaps it s holler and full of something whispered Wegg He was going to dig with whatsoever object for he tucked up his cuffs and spat on his hands and then went at it like an old digger as he was He had no design upon the pole except that he measured a shovel s length from it before beginning nor was it his purpose to dig deep Some dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed Then he stopped looked down into the cavity bent over it and took out what appeared to be an ordinary case bottle one of those squat high shouldered short necked glass bottles which the Dutchman is said to keep his Courage in As soon as he had done this he turned off his lantern and they could hear that he was filling up the hole in the dark The ashes being easily moved by a skilful hand the spies took this as a hint to make off in good time Accordingly mister Venus slipped past mister Wegg and towed him down But mister Wegg s descent was not accomplished without some personal inconvenience for his self willed leg sticking into the ashes about half way down and time pressing mister Venus took the liberty of hauling him from his tether by the collar which occasioned him to make the rest of the journey on his back with his head enveloped in the skirts of his coat and his wooden leg coming last like a drag So flustered was mister Wegg by this mode of travelling that when he was set on the level ground with his intellectual developments uppermost he was quite unconscious of his bearings and had not the least idea where his place of residence was to be found until mister Venus shoved him into it Even then he staggered round and round weakly staring about him until mister Venus with a hard brush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him mister Boffin came down leisurely for this brushing process had been well accomplished and mister Venus had had time to take his breath before he reappeared That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted where was not so clear He wore a large rough coat buttoned over and it might be in any one of half a dozen pockets What s the matter Wegg said mister Boffin You are as pale as a candle mister Wegg replied with literal exactness that he felt as if he had had a turn Bile said mister Boffin blowing out the light in the lantern shutting it up and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before Are you subject to bile Wegg mister Wegg again replied with strict adherence to truth that he didn t think he had ever had a similar sensation in his head to anything like the same extent Physic yourself to morrow Wegg said mister Boffin to be in order for next night By the by this neighbourhood is going to have a loss Wegg A loss sir Going to lose the Mounds The friendly movers made such an obvious effort not to look at one another that they might as well have stared at one another with all their might Have you parted with them mister Boffin asked Silas Yes they re going Mine s as good as gone already You mean the little one of the three with the pole atop sir Yes said mister Boffin rubbing his ear in his old way with that new touch of craftiness added to it It has fetched a penny It ll begin to be carted off to morrow Have you been out to take leave of your old friend sir asked Silas jocosely No said mister Boffin What the devil put that in your head He was so sudden and rough that Wegg who had been hovering closer and closer to his skirts despatching the back of his hand on exploring expeditions in search of the bottle s surface retired two or three paces No offence sir said Wegg humbly No offence mister Boffin eyed him as a dog might eye another dog who wanted his bone and actually retorted with a low growl as the dog might have retorted Good night he said after having sunk into a moody silence with his hands clasped behind him and his eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg No stop there I know the way out and I want no light Avarice and the evening s legends of avarice and the inflammatory effect of what he had seen and perhaps the rush of his ill conditioned blood to his brain in his descent wrought Silas Wegg to such a pitch of insatiable appetite that when the door closed he made a swoop at it and drew Venus along with him He mustn t go he cried We mustn t let him go He has got that bottle about him We must have that bottle Why you wouldn t take it by force said Venus restraining him Wouldn t I Yes I would I d take it by any force I d have it at any price Are you so afraid of one old man as to let him go you coward I am so afraid of you as not to let YOU go muttered Venus sturdily clasping him in his arms Did you hear him retorted Wegg Did you hear him say that he was resolved to disappoint us Did you hear him say you cur that he was going to have the Mounds cleared off when no doubt the whole place will be rummaged If you haven t the spirit of a mouse to defend your rights I have Let me go after him As in his wildness he was making a strong struggle for it mister Venus deemed it expedient to lift him throw him and fall with him well knowing that once down he would not be up again easily with his wooden leg So they both rolled on the floor and as they did so mister Boffin shut the gate Chapter seven THE FRIENDLY MOVE TAKES UP A STRONG POSITION The friendly movers sat upright on the floor panting and eyeing one another after mister Boffin had slammed the gate and gone away In the weak eyes of Venus and in every reddish dust coloured hair in his shock of hair there was a marked distrust of Wegg and an alertness to fly at him on perceiving the smallest occasion In the hard grained face of Wegg and in his stiff knotty figure he looked like a German wooden toy there was expressed a politic conciliation which had no spontaneity in it Both were flushed flustered and rumpled by the late scuffle and Wegg in coming to the ground had received a humming knock on the back of his devoted head which caused him still to rub it with an air of having been highly but disagreeably astonished Each was silent for some time leaving it to the other to begin Brother said Wegg at length breaking the silence you were right and I was wrong I forgot myself mister Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair as rather thinking mister Wegg had remembered himself in respect of appearing without any disguise But comrade pursued Wegg it was never your lot to know Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane nor Uncle Parker mister Venus admitted that he had never known those distinguished persons and added in effect that he had never so much as desired the honour of their acquaintance Don t say that comrade retorted Wegg No don t say that Because without having known them you never can fully know what it is to be stimilated to frenzy by the sight of the Usurper Offering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on himself mister Wegg impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in a corner of the room and there after a variety of awkward gambols attained a perpendicular position mister Venus also rose Comrade said Wegg take a seat Comrade what a speaking countenance is yours mister Venus involuntarily smoothed his countenance and looked at his hand as if to see whether any of its speaking properties came off For clearly do I know mark you pursued Wegg pointing his words with his forefinger clearly do I know what question your expressive features puts to me What question said Venus The question returned Wegg with a sort of joyful affability why I didn t mention sooner that I had found something Says your speaking countenance to me Why didn t you communicate that when I first come in this evening Why did you keep it back till you thought mister Boffin had come to look for the article Your speaking countenance said Wegg puts it plainer than language Now you can t read in my face what answer I give No I can t said Venus I knew it And why not returned Wegg with the same joyful candour Because I lay no claims to a speaking countenance Because I am well aware of my deficiencies All men are not gifted alike But I can answer in words And in what words These I wanted to give you a delightful sap pur IZE Having thus elongated and emphasized the word Surprise mister Wegg shook his friend and brother by both hands and then clapped him on both knees like an affectionate patron who entreated him not to mention so small a service as that which it had been his happy privilege to render Your speaking countenance said Wegg being answered to its satisfaction only asks then What have you found Why I hear it say the words Well retorted Venus snappishly after waiting in vain If you hear it say the words why don t you answer it Hear me out said Wegg I m a going to Hear me out Man and brother partner in feelings equally with undertakings and actions I have found a cash box Where Hear me out said Wegg He tried to reserve whatever he could and whenever disclosure was forced upon him broke into a radiant gush of Hear me out On a certain day sir When said Venus bluntly N no returned Wegg shaking his head at once observantly thoughtfully and playfully No sir That s not your expressive countenance which asks that question That s your voice merely your voice To proceed On a certain day sir I happened to be walking in the yard taking my lonely round for in the words of a friend of my own family the author of All s Well arranged as a duett Deserted as you will remember mister Venus by the waning moon When stars it will occur to you before I mention it proclaim night s cheerless noon On tower fort or tented ground The sentry walks his lonely round The sentry walks under those circumstances sir I happened to be walking in the yard early one afternoon and happened to have an iron rod in my hand with which I have been sometimes accustomed to beguile the monotony of a literary life when I struck it against an object not necessary to trouble you by naming It is necessary What object demanded Venus in a wrathful tone Hear me out said Wegg The Pump When I struck it against the Pump and found not only that the top was loose and opened with a lid but that something in it rattled That something comrade I discovered to be a small flat oblong cash box Shall I say it was disappointingly light There were papers in it said Venus There your expressive countenance speaks indeed cried Wegg A paper The box was locked tied up and sealed and on the outside was a parchment label with the writing MY WILL JOHN HARMON TEMPORARILY DEPOSITED HERE We must know its contents said Venus Hear me out cried Wegg I said so and I broke the box open Without coming to me exclaimed Venus Exactly so sir returned Wegg blandly and buoyantly I see I take you with me Hear hear hear Resolved as your discriminating good sense perceives that if you was to have a sap pur IZE it should be a complete one Well sir And so as you have honoured me by anticipating I examined the document Regularly executed regularly witnessed very short Inasmuch as he has never made friends and has ever had a rebellious family he John Harmon gives to Nicodemus Boffin the Little Mound which is quite enough for him and gives the whole rest and residue of his property to the Crown The date of the will that has been proved must be looked to remarked Venus It may be later than this one Hear me out cried Wegg I said so I paid a shilling never mind your sixpence of it to look up that will Brother that will is dated months before this will And now as a fellow man and as a partner in a friendly move added Wegg benignantly taking him by both hands again and clapping him on both knees again say have I completed my labour of love to your perfect satisfaction and are you sap pur IZED mister Venus contemplated his fellow man and partner with doubting eyes and then rejoined stiffly This is great news indeed mister Wegg There s no denying it But I could have wished you had told it me before you got your fright to night and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were to do before you thought you were dividing a responsibility Hear me out cried Wegg I knew you was a going to say so But alone I bore the anxiety and alone I ll bear the blame This with an air of great magnanimity No said Venus Let s see this will and this box Do I understand brother returned Wegg with considerable reluctance that it is your wish to see this will and this mister Venus smote the table with his hand Hear me out said Wegg Hear me out I ll go and fetch em After being some time absent as if in his covetousness he could hardly make up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner he returned with an old leathern hat box into which he had put the other box for the better preservation of commonplace appearances and for the disarming of suspicion But I don t half like opening it here said Silas in a low voice looking around he might come back he may not be gone we don t know what he may be up to after what we ve seen There s something in that assented Venus Come to my place Jealous of the custody of the box and yet fearful of opening it under the existing circumstances Wegg hesitated Come I tell you repeated Venus chafing to my place Not very well seeing his way to a refusal mister Wegg then rejoined in a gush Hear me out Certainly So he locked up the Bower and they set forth mister Venus taking his arm and keeping it with remarkable tenacity They found the usual dim light burning in the window of mister Venus s establishment imperfectly disclosing to the public the usual pair of preserved frogs sword in hand with their point of honour still unsettled mister Venus had closed his shop door on coming out and now opened it with the key and shut it again as soon as they were within but not before he had put up and barred the shutters of the shop window No one can get in without being let in said he then and we couldn t be more snug than here So he raked together the yet warm cinders in the rusty grate and made a fire and trimmed the candle on the little counter As the fire cast its flickering gleams here and there upon the dark greasy walls the Hindoo baby the African baby the articulated English baby the assortment of skulls and the rest of the collection came starting to their various stations as if they had all been out like their master and were punctual in a general rendezvous to assist at the secret The French gentleman had grown considerably since mister Wegg last saw him being now accommodated with a pair of legs and a head though his arms were yet in abeyance To whomsoever the head had originally belonged Silas Wegg would have regarded it as a personal favour if he had not cut quite so many teeth Silas took his seat in silence on the wooden box before the fire and Venus dropping into his low chair produced from among his skeleton hands his tea tray and tea cups and put the kettle on Silas inwardly approved of these preparations trusting they might end in mister Venus s diluting his intellect Now sir said Venus all is safe and quiet Let us see this discovery With still reluctant hands and not without several glances towards the skeleton hands as if he mistrusted that a couple of them might spring forth and clutch the document Wegg opened the hat box and revealed the cash box opened the cash box and revealed the will He held a corner of it tight while Venus taking hold of another corner searchingly and attentively read it Was I correct in my account of it partner said mister Wegg at length Partner you were said mister Venus mister Wegg thereupon made an easy graceful movement as though he would fold it up but mister Venus held on by his corner No sir said mister Venus winking his weak eyes and shaking his head No partner The question is now brought up who is going to take care of this Do you know who is going to take care of this partner I am said Wegg Oh dear no partner retorted Venus That s a mistake I am Now look here mister Wegg I don t want to have any words with you and still less do I want to have any anatomical pursuits with you What do you mean said Wegg quickly I mean partner replied Venus slowly that it s hardly possible for a man to feel in a more amiable state towards another man than I do towards you at this present moment But I am on my own ground I am surrounded by the trophies of my art and my tools is very handy What do you mean mister Venus asked Wegg again I am surrounded as I have observed said mister Venus placidly by the trophies of my art They are numerous my stock of human warious is large the shop is pretty well crammed and I don t just now want any more trophies of my art But I like my art and I know how to exercise my art No man better assented mister Wegg with a somewhat staggered air There s the Miscellanies of several human specimens said Venus though you mightn t think it in the box on which you re sitting There s the Miscellanies of several human specimens in the lovely compo one behind the door with a nod towards the French gentleman It still wants a pair of arms I DON T say that I m in any hurry for em You must be wandering in your mind partner Silas remonstrated You ll excuse me if I wander returned Venus I am sometimes rather subject to it I like my art and I know how to exercise my art and I mean to have the keeping of this document But what has that got to do with your art partner asked Wegg in an insinuating tone mister Venus winked his chronically fatigued eyes both at once and adjusting the kettle on the fire remarked to himself in a hollow voice She ll bile in a couple of minutes Silas Wegg glanced at the kettle glanced at the shelves glanced at the French gentleman behind the door and shrank a little as he glanced at mister Venus winking his red eyes and feeling in his waistcoat pocket as for a lancet say with his unoccupied hand He and Venus were necessarily seated close together as each held a corner of the document which was but a common sheet of paper Partner said Wegg even more insinuatingly than before I propose that we cut it in half and each keep a half Venus shook his shock of hair as he replied It wouldn t do to mutilate it partner It might seem to be cancelled Partner said Wegg after a silence during which they had contemplated one another don t your speaking countenance say that you re a going to suggest a middle course Venus shook his shock of hair as he replied Partner you have kept this paper from me once You shall never keep it from me again I offer you the box and the label to take care of but I ll take care of the paper Silas hesitated a little longer and then suddenly releasing his corner and resuming his buoyant and benignant tone exclaimed What s life without trustfulness What s a fellow man without honour You re welcome to it partner in a spirit of trust and confidence Continuing to wink his red eyes both together but in a self communing way and without any show of triumph mister Venus folded the paper now left in his hand and locked it in a drawer behind him and pocketed the key He then proposed A cup of tea partner To which mister Wegg returned Thank ee partner and the tea was made and poured out Next said Venus blowing at his tea in his saucer and looking over it at his confidential friend comes the question What s the course to be pursued On this head Silas Wegg had much to say Silas had to say That he would beg to remind his comrade brother and partner of the impressive passages they had read that evening of the evident parallel in mister Boffin s mind between them and the late owner of the Bower and the present circumstances of the Bower of the bottle and of the box That the fortunes of his brother and comrade and of himself were evidently made inasmuch as they had but to put their price upon this document and get that price from the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour who now appeared to be less of a minion and more of a worm than had been previously supposed That he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word and that the word was Halves That the question then arose when Halves should be called That here he had a plan of action to recommend with a conditional clause That the plan of action was that they should lie by with patience that they should allow the Mounds to be gradually levelled and cleared away while retaining to themselves their present opportunity of watching the process which would be he conceived to put the trouble and cost of daily digging and delving upon somebody else while they might nightly turn such complete disturbance of the dust to the account of their own private investigations and that when the Mounds were gone and they had worked those chances for their own joint benefit solely they should then and not before explode on the minion and worm But here came the conditional clause and to this he entreated the special attention of his comrade brother and partner It was not to be borne that the minion and worm should carry off any of that property which was now to be regarded as their own property When he mister Wegg had seen the minion surreptitiously making off with that bottle and its precious contents unknown he had looked upon him in the light of a mere robber and as such would have despoiled him of his ill gotten gain but for the judicious interference of his comrade brother and partner Therefore the conditional clause he proposed was that if the minion should return in his late sneaking manner and if being closely watched he should be found to possess himself of anything no matter what the sharp sword impending over his head should be instantly shown him he should be strictly examined as to what he knew or suspected should be severely handled by them his masters and should be kept in a state of abject moral bondage and slavery until the time when they should see fit to permit him to purchase his freedom at the price of half his possessions If said mister Wegg by way of peroration he had erred in saying only Halves he trusted to his comrade brother and partner not to hesitate to set him right and to reprove his weakness It might be more according to the rights of things to say Two thirds it might be more according to the rights of things to say Three fourths On those points he was ever open to correction mister Venus having wafted his attention to this discourse over three successive saucers of tea signified his concurrence in the views advanced Inspirited hereby mister Wegg extended his right hand and declared it to be a hand which never yet Without entering into more minute particulars mister Venus sticking to his tea briefly professed his belief as polite forms required of him that it WAS a hand which never yet But contented himself with looking at it and did not take it to his bosom Brother said Wegg when this happy understanding was established I should like to ask you something You remember the night when I first looked in here and found you floating your powerful mind in tea Still swilling tea mister Venus nodded assent And there you sit sir pursued Wegg with an air of thoughtful admiration as if you had never left off There you sit sir as if you had an unlimited capacity of assimilating the flagrant article There you sit sir in the midst of your works looking as if you d been called upon for Home Sweet Home and was obleeging the company A exile from home splendour dazzles in vain O give you your lowly Preparations again The birds stuffed so sweetly that can t be expected to come at your call Give you these with the peace of mind dearer than all Home Home Home sweet Home Be it ever added mister Wegg in prose as he glanced about the shop ever so ghastly all things considered there s no place like it You said you d like to ask something but you haven t asked it remarked Venus very unsympathetic in manner Your peace of mind said Wegg offering condolence your peace of mind was in a poor way that night HOW S it going on IS it looking up at all She does not wish replied mister Venus with a comical mixture of indignant obstinacy and tender melancholy to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that particular light There s no more to be said Ah dear me dear me exclaimed Wegg with a sigh but eyeing him while pretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire such is Woman And I remember you said that night sitting there as I sat here said that night when your peace of mind was first laid low that you had taken an interest in these very affairs Such is coincidence Her father rejoined Venus and then stopped to swallow more tea her father was mixed up in them You didn t mention her name sir I think observed Wegg pensively No you didn t mention her name that night Pleasant Riderhood In deed cried Wegg Pleasant Riderhood There s something moving in the name Pleasant Dear me Seems to express what she might have been if she hadn t made that unpleasant remark and what she ain t in consequence of having made it Would it at all pour balm into your wounds mister Venus to inquire how you came acquainted with her I was down at the water side said Venus taking another gulp of tea and mournfully winking at the fire looking for parrots taking another gulp and stopping mister Wegg hinted to jog his attention You could hardly have been out parrot shooting in the British climate sir No no no said Venus fretfully I was down at the water side looking for parrots brought home by sailors to buy for stuffing Ay ay ay sir And looking for a nice pair of rattlesnakes to articulate for a Museum when I was doomed to fall in with her and deal with her It was just at the time of that discovery in the river Her father had seen the discovery being towed in the river I made the popularity of the subject a reason for going back to improve the acquaintance and I have never since been the man I was My very bones is rendered flabby by brooding over it If they could be brought to me loose to sort I should hardly have the face to claim em as mine To such an extent have I fallen off under it mister Wegg less interested than he had been glanced at one particular shelf in the dark Why I remember mister Venus he said in a tone of friendly commiseration for I remember every word that falls from you sir I remember that you said that night you had got up there and then your words was Never mind The parrot that I bought of her said Venus with a despondent rise and fall of his eyes Yes there it lies on its side dried up except for its plumage very like myself I ve never had the heart to prepare it and I never shall have now With a disappointed face Silas mentally consigned this parrot to regions more than tropical and seeming for the time to have lost his power of assuming an interest in the woes of mister Venus fell to tightening his wooden leg as a preparation for departure its gymnastic performances of that evening having severely tried its constitution After Silas had left the shop hat box in hand and had left mister Venus to lower himself to oblivion point with the requisite weight of tea it greatly preyed on his ingenuous mind that he had taken this artist into partnership at all He bitterly felt that he had overreached himself in the beginning by grasping at mister Venus s mere straws of hints now shown to be worthless for his purpose Casting about for ways and means of dissolving the connexion without loss of money reproaching himself for having been betrayed into an avowal of his secret and complimenting himself beyond measure on his purely accidental good luck he beguiled the distance between Clerkenwell and the mansion of the Golden Dustman For Silas Wegg felt it to be quite out of the question that he could lay his head upon his pillow in peace without first hovering over mister Boffin s house in the superior character of its Evil Genius Power unless it be the power of intellect or virtue has ever the greatest attraction for the lowest natures and the mere defiance of the unconscious house front with his power to strip the roof off the inhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards was a treat which had a charm for Silas Wegg As he hovered on the opposite side of the street exulting the carriage drove up There ll shortly be an end of YOU said Wegg threatening it with the hat box YOUR varnish is fading missus Boffin descended and went in Look out for a fall my Lady Dustwoman said Wegg Bella lightly descended and ran in after her How brisk we are said Wegg You won t run so gaily to your old shabby home my girl You ll have to go there though A little while and the Secretary came out I was passed over for you said Wegg But you had better provide yourself with another situation young man mister Boffin s shadow passed upon the blinds of three large windows as he trotted down the room and passed again as he went back Yoop cried Wegg You re there are you Where s the bottle You would give your bottle for my box Dustman Having now composed his mind for slumber he turned homeward Such was the greed of the fellow that his mind had shot beyond halves two thirds three fourths and gone straight to spoliation of the whole Though that wouldn t quite do he considered growing cooler as he got away That s what would happen to him if he didn t buy us up We should get nothing by that We so judge others by ourselves that it had never come into his head before that he might not buy us up and might prove honest and prefer to be poor It caused him a slight tremor as it passed but a very slight one for the idle thought was gone directly He s grown too fond of money for that said Wegg he s grown too fond of money The burden fell into a strain or tune as he stumped along the pavements All the way home he stumped it out of the rattling streets PIANO with his own foot and FORTE with his wooden leg He s GROWN too FOND of MONEY for THAT he s GROWN too FOND of MONEY Even next day Silas soothed himself with this melodious strain when he was called out of bed at daybreak to set open the yard gate and admit the train of carts and horses that came to carry off the little Mound And all day long as he kept unwinking watch on the slow process which promised to protract itself through many days and weeks whenever to save himself from being choked with dust he patrolled a little cinderous beat he established for the purpose without taking his eyes from the diggers he still stumped to the tune He s GROWN too FOND of MONEY for THAT he s GROWN too FOND of MONEY Chapter eight THE END OF A LONG JOURNEY The train of carts and horses came and went all day from dawn to nightfall making little or no daily impression on the heap of ashes though as the days passed on the heap was seen to be slowly melting My lords and gentlemen and honourable boards when you in the course of your dust shovelling and cinder raking have piled up a mountain of pretentious failure you must off with your honourable coats for the removal of it and fall to the work with the power of all the queen s horses and all the queen s men or it will come rushing down and bury us alive Yes verily my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards adapting your Catechism to the occasion and by God s help so you must For when we have got things to the pass that with an enormous treasure at disposal to relieve the poor the best of the poor detest our mercies hide their heads from us and shame us by starving to death in the midst of us it is a pass impossible of prosperity impossible of continuance It may not be so written in the Gospel according to Podsnappery you may not find these words for the text of a sermon in the Returns of the Board of Trade but they have been the truth since the foundations of the universe were laid and they will be the truth until the foundations of the universe are shaken by the Builder This boastful handiwork of ours which fails in its terrors for the professional pauper the sturdy breaker of windows and the rampant tearer of clothes strikes with a cruel and a wicked stab at the stricken sufferer and is a horror to the deserving and unfortunate We must mend it lords and gentlemen and honourable boards or in its own evil hour it will mar every one of us Old Betty Higden fared upon her pilgrimage as many ruggedly honest creatures women and men fare on their toiling way along the roads of life Patiently to earn a spare bare living and quietly to die untouched by workhouse hands this was her highest sublunary hope Nothing had been heard of her at mister Boffin s house since she trudged off The weather had been hard and the roads had been bad and her spirit was up A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such adverse influences but the loan for her little outfit was in no part repaid and it had gone worse with her than she had foreseen and she was put upon proving her case and maintaining her independence Faithful soul When she had spoken to the Secretary of that deadness that steals over me at times her fortitude had made too little of it Oftener and ever oftener it came stealing over her darker and ever darker like the shadow of advancing Death That the shadow should be deep as it came on like the shadow of an actual presence was in accordance with the laws of the physical world for all the Light that shone on Betty Higden lay beyond Death The poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as her general track it was the track in which her last home lay and of which she had last had local love and knowledge She had hovered for a little while in the near neighbourhood of her abandoned dwelling and had sold and knitted and sold and gone on In the pleasant towns of Chertsey Walton Kingston and Staines her figure came to be quite well known for some short weeks and then again passed on She would take her stand in market places where there were such things on market days at other times in the busiest that was seldom very busy portion of the little quiet High Street at still other times she would explore the outlying roads for great houses and would ask leave at the Lodge to pass in with her basket and would not often get it But ladies in carriages would frequently make purchases from her trifling stock and were usually pleased with her bright eyes and her hopeful speech In these and her clean dress originated a fable that she was well to do in the world one might say for her station rich As making a comfortable provision for its subject which costs nobody anything this class of fable has long been popular In those pleasant little towns on Thames you may hear the fall of the water over the weirs or even in still weather the rustle of the rushes and from the bridge you may see the young river dimpled like a young child playfully gliding away among the trees unpolluted by the defilements that lie in wait for it on its course and as yet out of hearing of the deep summons of the sea It were too much to pretend that Betty Higden made out such thoughts no but she heard the tender river whispering to many like herself Come to me come to me When the cruel shame and terror you have so long fled from most beset you come to me I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it My breast is softer than the pauper nurse s death in my arms is peacefuller than among the pauper wards Come to me There was abundant place for gentler fancies too in her untutored mind Those gentlefolks and their children inside those fine houses could they think as they looked out at her what it was to be really hungry really cold Did they feel any of the wonder about her that she felt about them Bless the dear laughing children If they could have seen sick Johnny in her arms would they have cried for pity If they could have seen dead Johnny on that little bed would they have understood it Bless the dear children for his sake anyhow So with the humbler houses in the little street the inner firelight shining on the panes as the outer twilight darkened When the families gathered in doors there for the night it was only a foolish fancy to feel as if it were a little hard in them to close the shutter and blacken the flame So with the lighted shops and speculations whether their masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back parlour not so far within but that the flavour of tea and toast came out mingled with the glow of light into the street ate or drank or wore what they sold with the greater relish because they dealt in it So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night s sleeping place Ah me The dead and I seem to have it pretty much to ourselves in the dark and in this weather But so much the better for all who are warmly housed at home The poor soul envied no one in bitterness and grudged no one anything But the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as she grew weaker and it found more sustaining food than she did in her wanderings Now she would light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature or some wretched ragged groups of either sex or of both sexes with children among them huddled together like the smaller vermin for a little warmth lingering and lingering on a doorstep while the appointed evader of the public trust did his dirty office of trying to weary them out and so get rid of them Now she would light upon some poor decent person like herself going afoot on a pilgrimage of many weary miles to see some worn out relative or friend who had been charitably clutched off to a great blank barren Union House as far from old home as the County Jail the remoteness of which is always its worst punishment for small rural offenders and in its dietary and in its lodging and in its tending of the sick a much more penal establishment Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out and would learn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the last week died of want and of exposure to the weather for which that Recording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum as if they were its halfpence All such things she would hear discussed as we my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards in our unapproachable magnificence never hear them and from all such things she would fly with the wings of raging Despair This is not to be received as a figure of speech Old Betty Higden however tired however footsore would start up and be driven away by her awakened horror of falling into the hands of Charity It is a remarkable Christian improvement to have made a pursuing Fury of the Good Samaritan but it was so in this case and it is a type of many many many Two incidents united to intensify the old unreasoning abhorrence granted in a previous place to be unreasoning because the people always are unreasoning and invariably make a point of producing all their smoke without fire One day she was sitting in a market place on a bench outside an inn with her little wares for sale when the deadness that she strove against came over her so heavily that the scene departed from before her eyes when it returned she found herself on the ground her head supported by some good natured market women and a little crowd about her Are you better now mother asked one of the women Do you think you can do nicely now Have I been ill then asked old Betty You have had a faint like was the answer or a fit It ain t that you ve been a struggling mother but you ve been stiff and numbed Ah said Betty recovering her memory It s the numbness Yes It comes over me at times Was it gone the women asked her It s gone now said Betty I shall be stronger than I was afore Many thanks to ye my dears and when you come to be as old as I am may others do as much for you They assisted her to rise but she could not stand yet and they supported her when she sat down again upon the bench My head s a bit light and my feet are a bit heavy said old Betty leaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken before They ll both come nat ral in a minute There s nothing more the matter Ask her said some farmers standing by who had come out from their market dinner who belongs to her Are there any folks belonging to you mother said the woman Yes sure answered Betty I heerd the gentleman say it but I couldn t answer quick enough There s plenty belonging to me Don t ye fear for me my dear But are any of em near here said the men s voices the women s voices chiming in when it was said and prolonging the strain Quite near enough said Betty rousing herself Don t ye be afeard for me neighbours But you are not fit to travel Where are you going was the next compassionate chorus she heard I m a going to London when I ve sold out all said Betty rising with difficulty I ve right good friends in London I want for nothing I shall come to no harm Thankye Don t ye be afeard for me A well meaning bystander yellow legginged and purple faced said hoarsely over his red comforter as she rose to her feet that she oughtn t to be let to go For the Lord s love don t meddle with me cried old Betty all her fears crowding on her I am quite well now and I must go this minute She caught up her basket as she spoke and was making an unsteady rush away from them when the same bystander checked her with his hand on her sleeve and urged her to come with him and see the parish doctor Strengthening herself by the utmost exercise of her resolution the poor trembling creature shook him off almost fiercely and took to flight Nor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by road between herself and the marketplace and had crept into a copse like a hunted animal to hide and recover breath Not until then for the first time did she venture to recall how she had looked over her shoulder before turning out of the town and had seen the sign of the White Lion hanging across the road and the fluttering market booths and the old grey church and the little crowd gazing after her but not attempting to follow her The second frightening incident was this She had been again as bad and had been for some days better and was travelling along by a part of the road where it touched the river and in wet seasons was so often overflowed by it that there were tall white posts set up to mark the way A barge was being towed towards her and she sat down on the bank to rest and watch it As the tow rope was slackened by a turn of the stream and dipped into the water such a confusion stole into her mind that she thought she saw the forms of her dead children and dead grandchildren peopling the barge and waving their hands to her in solemn measure then as the rope tightened and came up dropping diamonds it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike her with a twang though it was far off When she looked again there was no barge no river no daylight and a man whom she had never before seen held a candle close to her face Now Missis said he where did you come from and where are you going to The poor soul confusedly asked the counter question where she was I am the Lock said the man The Lock I am the Deputy Lock on job and this is the Lock house Lock or Deputy Lock it s all one while the t other man s in the hospital What s your Parish Parish She was up from the truckle bed directly wildly feeling about her for her basket and gazing at him in affright You ll be asked the question down town said the man They won t let you be more than a Casual there They ll pass you on to your settlement Missis with all speed You re not in a state to be let come upon strange parishes ceptin as a Casual Twas the deadness again murmured Betty Higden with her hand to her head It was the deadness there s not a doubt about it returned the man I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it if it had been named to me when we brought you in Have you got any friends Missis The best of friends Master I should recommend your looking em up if you consider em game to do anything for you said the Deputy Lock Have you got any money Just a morsel of money sir Do you want to keep it Sure I do Well you know said the Deputy Lock shrugging his shoulders with his hands in his pockets and shaking his head in a sulkily ominous manner the parish authorities down town will have it out of you if you go on you may take your Alfred David Then I ll not go on They ll make you pay as fur as your money will go pursued the Deputy for your relief as a Casual and for your being passed to your Parish Thank ye kindly Master for your warning thank ye for your shelter and good night Stop a bit said the Deputy striking in between her and the door Why are you all of a shake and what s your hurry Missis Oh Master Master returned Betty Higden I ve fought against the Parish and fled from it all my life and I want to die free of it I don t know said the Deputy with deliberation as I ought to let you go I m a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow and I may fall into trouble by letting you go I ve fell into trouble afore now by George and I know what it is and it s made me careful You might be took with your deadness again half a mile off or half of half a quarter for the matter of that and then it would be asked Why did that there honest Deputy Lock let her go instead of putting her safe with the Parish That s what a man of his character ought to have done it would be argueyfied said the Deputy Lock cunningly harping on the strong string of her terror he ought to have handed her over safe to the Parish That was to be expected of a man of his merits As he stood in the doorway the poor old careworn wayworn woman burst into tears and clasped her hands as if in a very agony she prayed to him As I ve told you Master I ve the best of friends This letter will show how true I spoke and they will be thankful for me The Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face which underwent no change as he eyed its contents But it might have done if he could have read them What amount of small change Missis he said with an abstracted air after a little meditation might you call a morsel of money Hurriedly emptying her pocket old Betty laid down on the table a shilling and two sixpenny pieces and a few pence If I was to let you go instead of handing you over safe to the Parish said the Deputy counting the money with his eyes might it be your own free wish to leave that there behind you Take it Master take it and welcome and thankful I m a man said the Deputy giving her back the letter and pocketing the coins one by one as earns his living by the sweat of his brow here he drew his sleeve across his forehead as if this particular portion of his humble gains were the result of sheer hard labour and virtuous industry and I won t stand in your way Go where you like She was gone out of the Lock house as soon as he gave her this permission and her tottering steps were on the road again But afraid to go back and afraid to go forward seeing what she fled from in the sky glare of the lights of the little town before her and leaving a confused horror of it everywhere behind her as if she had escaped it in every stone of every market place she struck off by side ways among which she got bewildered and lost That night she took refuge from the Samaritan in his latest accredited form under a farmer s rick and if worth thinking of perhaps my fellow Christians the Samaritan had in the lonely night passed by on the other side she would have most devoutly thanked High Heaven for her escape from him The morning found her afoot again but fast declining as to the clearness of her thoughts though not as to the steadiness of her purpose Comprehending that her strength was quitting her and that the struggle of her life was almost ended she could neither reason out the means of getting back to her protectors nor even form the idea The overmastering dread and the proud stubborn resolution it engendered in her to die undegraded were the two distinct impressions left in her failing mind Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life long fight she went on The time was come now when the wants of this little life were passing away from her She could not have swallowed food though a table had been spread for her in the next field The day was cold and wet but she scarcely knew it She crept on poor soul like a criminal afraid of being taken and felt little beyond the terror of falling down while it was yet daylight and being found alive She had no fear that she would live through another night Sewn in the breast of her gown the money to pay for her burial was still intact If she could wear through the day and then lie down to die under cover of the darkness she would die independent If she were captured previously the money would be taken from her as a pauper who had no right to it and she would be carried to the accursed workhouse Gaining her end the letter would be found in her breast along with the money and the gentlefolks would say when it was given back to them She prized it did old Betty Higden she was true to it and while she lived she would never let it be disgraced by falling into the hands of those that she held in horror Most illogical inconsequential and light headed this but travellers in the valley of the shadow of death are apt to be light headed and worn out old people of low estate have a trick of reasoning as indifferently as they live and doubtless would appreciate our Poor Law more philosophically on an income of ten thousand a year So keeping to byways and shunning human approach this troublesome old woman hid herself and fared on all through the dreary day Yet so unlike was she to vagrant hiders in general that sometimes as the day advanced there was a bright fire in her eyes and a quicker beating at her feeble heart as though she said exultingly The Lord will see me through it By what visionary hands she was led along upon that journey of escape from the Samaritan by what voices hushed in the grave she seemed to be addressed how she fancied the dead child in her arms again and times innumerable adjusted her shawl to keep it warm what infinite variety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took how many furious horsemen rode at her crying There she goes Stop Stop Betty Higden and melted away as they came close be these things left untold Faring on and hiding hiding and faring on the poor harmless creature as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up after her wore out the day and gained the night Water meadows or such like she had sometimes murmured on the day s pilgrimage when she had raised her head and taken any note of the real objects about her There now arose in the darkness a great building full of lighted windows Smoke was issuing from a high chimney in the rear of it and there was the sound of a water wheel at the side Between her and the building lay a piece of water in which the lighted windows were reflected and on its nearest margin was a plantation of trees I humbly thank the Power and the Glory said Betty Higden holding up her withered hands that I have come to my journey s end She crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see beyond some intervening trees and branches the lighted windows both in their reality and their reflection in the water She placed her orderly little basket at her side and sank upon the ground supporting herself against the tree It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross and she committed herself to Him who died upon it Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there It had held out for this and it departed when this was done I am safe here was her last benumbed thought When I am found dead at the foot of the Cross it will be by some of my own sort some of the working people who work among the lights yonder I cannot see the lighted windows now but they are there I am thankful for all The darkness gone and a face bending down It cannot be the boofer lady I don t understand what you say Let me wet your lips again with this brandy I have been away to fetch it Did you think that I was long gone It is as the face of a woman shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair It is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome But all is over with me on earth and this must be an Angel Have I been long dead I don t understand what you say Let me wet your lips again I hurried all I could and brought no one back with me lest you should die of the shock of strangers Am I not dead I cannot understand what you say Your voice is so low and broken that I cannot hear you Do you hear me Yes Do you mean Yes Yes I was coming from my work just now along the path outside I was up with the night hands last night and I heard a groan and found you lying here What work deary Did you ask what work At the paper mill Where is it Your face is turned up to the sky and you can t see it It is close by You can see my face here between you and the sky Yes Dare I lift you Not yet Not even lift your head to get it on my arm I will do it by very gentle degrees You shall hardly feel it Not yet Paper Letter This paper in your breast Bless ye Let me wet your lips again Am I to open it To read it Bless ye She reads it with surprise and looks down with a new expression and an added interest on the motionless face she kneels beside I know these names I have heard them often Will you send it my dear I cannot understand you Let me wet your lips again and your forehead There O poor thing poor thing These words through her fast dropping tears What was it that you asked me Wait till I bring my ear quite close Will you send it my dear Will I send it to the writers Is that your wish Yes certainly You ll not give it up to any one but them No As you must grow old in time and come to your dying hour my dear you ll not give it up to any one but them No Most solemnly Never to the Parish with a convulsed struggle No Most solemnly Nor let the Parish touch me not yet so much as look at me with another struggle No Faithfully A look of thankfulness and triumph lights the worn old face The eyes which have been darkly fixed upon the sky turn with meaning in them towards the compassionate face from which the tears are dropping and a smile is on the aged lips as they ask What is your name my dear My name is Lizzie Hexam I must be sore disfigured Are you afraid to kiss me The answer is the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling mouth Bless ye NOW lift me my love Lizzie Hexam very softly raised the weather stained grey head and lifted her as high as Heaven Chapter nine SOMEBODY BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF A PREDICTION We give thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world So read the Reverend Frank Milvey in a not untroubled voice for his heart misgave him that all was not quite right between us and our sister or say our sister in Law Poor Law and that we sometimes read these words in an awful manner over our Sister and our Brother too And Sloppy on whom the brave deceased had never turned her back until she ran away from him knowing that otherwise he would not be separated from her Sloppy could not in his conscience as yet find the hearty thanks required of it Selfish in Sloppy and yet excusable it may be humbly hoped because our sister had been more than his mother The words were read above the ashes of Betty Higden in a corner of a churchyard near the river in a churchyard so obscure that there was nothing in it but grass mounds not so much as one single tombstone It might not be to do an unreasonably great deal for the diggers and hewers in a registering age if we ticketed their graves at the common charge so that a new generation might know which was which so that the soldier sailor emigrant coming home should be able to identify the resting place of father mother playmate or betrothed For we turn up our eyes and say that we are all alike in death and we might turn them down and work the saying out in this world so far It would be sentimental perhaps But how say ye my lords and gentleman and honourable boards shall we not find good standing room left for a little sentiment if we look into our crowds Near unto the Reverend Frank Milvey as he read stood his little wife John Rokesmith the Secretary and Bella Wilfer These over and above Sloppy were the mourners at the lowly grave Not a penny had been added to the money sewn in her dress what her honest spirit had so long projected was fulfilled I ve took it in my head said Sloppy laying it inconsolable against the church door when all was done I ve took it in my wretched head that I might have sometimes turned a little harder for her and it cuts me deep to think so now The Reverend Frank Milvey comforting Sloppy expounded to him how the best of us were more or less remiss in our turnings at our respective Mangles some of us very much so and how we were all a halting failing feeble and inconstant crew SHE warn t sir said Sloppy taking this ghostly counsel rather ill in behalf of his late benefactress Let us speak for ourselves sir She went through with whatever duty she had to do She went through with me she went through with the Minders she went through with herself she went through with everythink O missus Higden missus Higden you was a woman and a mother and a mangler in a million million With those heartfelt words Sloppy removed his dejected head from the church door and took it back to the grave in the corner and laid it down there and wept alone Not a very poor grave said the Reverend Frank Milvey brushing his hand across his eyes when it has that homely figure on it Richer I think than it could be made by most of the sculpture in Westminster Abbey They left him undisturbed and passed out at the wicket gate The water wheel of the paper mill was audible there and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene They had arrived but a little while before and Lizzie Hexam now told them the little she could add to the letter in which she had enclosed mister Rokesmith s letter and had asked for their instructions This was merely how she had heard the groan and what had afterwards passed and how she had obtained leave for the remains to be placed in that sweet fresh empty store room of the mill from which they had just accompanied them to the churchyard and how the last requests had been religiously observed I could not have done it all or nearly all of myself said Lizzie I should not have wanted the will but I should not have had the power without our managing partner Surely not the Jew who received us said missus Milvey My dear observed her husband in parenthesis why not The gentleman certainly is a Jew said Lizzie and the lady his wife is a Jewess and I was first brought to their notice by a Jew But I think there cannot be kinder people in the world But suppose they try to convert you suggested missus Milvey bristling in her good little way as a clergyman s wife To do what ma am asked Lizzie with a modest smile To make you change your religion said missus Milvey Lizzie shook her head still smiling They have never asked me what my religion is They asked me what my story was and I told them They asked me to be industrious and faithful and I promised to be so They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are employed here and we try to do ours to them Indeed they do much more than their duty to us for they are wonderfully mindful of us in many ways It is easy to see you re a favourite my dear said little missus Milvey not quite pleased It would be very ungrateful in me to say I am not returned Lizzie for I have been already raised to a place of confidence here But that makes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving all of us to ours They never talk of theirs to us and they never talk of ours to us If I was the last in the mill it would be just the same They never asked me what religion that poor thing had followed My dear said missus Milvey aside to the Reverend Frank I wish you would talk to her My dear said the Reverend Frank aside to his good little wife I think I will leave it to somebody else The circumstances are hardly favourable There are plenty of talkers going about my love and she will soon find one While this discourse was interchanging both Bella and the Secretary observed Lizzie Hexam with great attention Brought face to face for the first time with the daughter of his supposed murderer it was natural that John Harmon should have his own secret reasons for a careful scrutiny of her countenance and manner Bella knew that Lizzie s father had been falsely accused of the crime which had had so great an influence on her own life and fortunes and her interest though it had no secret springs like that of the Secretary was equally natural Both had expected to see something very different from the real Lizzie Hexam and thus it fell out that she became the unconscious means of bringing them together For when they had walked on with her to the little house in the clean village by the paper mill where Lizzie had a lodging with an elderly couple employed in the establishment and when missus Milvey and Bella had been up to see her room and had come down the mill bell rang This called Lizzie away for the time and left the Secretary and Bella standing rather awkwardly in the small street missus Milvey being engaged in pursuing the village children and her investigations whether they were in danger of becoming children of Israel and the Reverend Frank being engaged to say the truth in evading that branch of his spiritual functions and getting out of sight surreptitiously Bella at length said Hadn t we better talk about the commission we have undertaken mister Rokesmith By all means said the Secretary I suppose faltered Bella that we ARE both commissioned or we shouldn t both be here I suppose so was the Secretary s answer When I proposed to come with mister and missus Milvey said Bella missus Boffin urged me to do so in order that I might give her my small report it s not worth anything mister Rokesmith except for it s being a woman s which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it s being worth nothing of Lizzie Hexam mister Boffin said the Secretary directed me to come for the same purpose As they spoke they were leaving the little street and emerging on the wooded landscape by the river You think well of her mister Rokesmith pursued Bella conscious of making all the advances I think highly of her I am so glad of that Something quite refined in her beauty is there not Her appearance is very striking There is a shade of sadness upon her that is quite touching At least I I am not setting up my own poor opinion you know mister Rokesmith said Bella excusing and explaining herself in a pretty shy way I am consulting you I noticed that sadness I hope it may not said the Secretary in a lower voice be the result of the false accusation which has been retracted When they had passed on a little further without speaking Bella after stealing a glance or two at the Secretary suddenly said Oh mister Rokesmith don t be hard with me don t be stern with me be magnanimous I want to talk with you on equal terms The Secretary as suddenly brightened and returned Upon my honour I had no thought but for you I forced myself to be constrained lest you might misinterpret my being more natural There It s gone Thank you said Bella holding out her little hand Forgive me No cried the Secretary eagerly Forgive ME For there were tears in her eyes and they were prettier in his sight though they smote him on the heart rather reproachfully too than any other glitter in the world When they had walked a little further You were going to speak to me said the Secretary with the shadow so long on him quite thrown off and cast away about Lizzie Hexam So was I going to speak to you if I could have begun Now that you CAN begin sir returned Bella with a look as if she italicized the word by putting one of her dimples under it what were you going to say You remember of course that in her short letter to missus Boffin short but containing everything to the purpose she stipulated that either her name or else her place of residence must be kept strictly a secret among us Bella nodded Yes It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation I have it in charge from mister Boffin to discover and I am very desirous for myself to discover whether that retracted accusation still leaves any stain upon her I mean whether it places her at any disadvantage towards any one even towards herself Yes said Bella nodding thoughtfully I understand That seems wise and considerate You may not have noticed Miss Wilfer that she has the same kind of interest in you that you have in her Just as you are attracted by her beaut by her appearance and manner she is attracted by yours I certainly have NOT noticed it returned Bella again italicizing with the dimple and I should have given her credit for The Secretary with a smile held up his hand so plainly interposing not for better taste that Bella s colour deepened over the little piece of coquetry she was checked in And so resumed the Secretary if you would speak with her alone before we go away from here I feel quite sure that a natural and easy confidence would arise between you Of course you would not be asked to betray it and of course you would not if you were But if you do not object to put this question to her to ascertain for us her own feeling in this one matter you can do so at a far greater advantage than I or any else could mister Boffin is anxious on the subject And I am added the Secretary after a moment for a special reason very anxious I shall be happy mister Rokesmith returned Bella to be of the least use for I feel after the serious scene of to day that I am useless enough in this world Don t say that urged the Secretary Oh but I mean that said Bella raising her eyebrows No one is useless in this world retorted the Secretary who lightens the burden of it for any one else But I assure you I DON T mister Rokesmith said Bella half crying Not for your father Dear loving self forgetting easily satisfied Pa Oh yes He thinks so It is enough if he only thinks so said the Secretary Excuse the interruption I don t like to hear you depreciate yourself But YOU once depreciated ME sir thought Bella pouting and I hope you may be satisfied with the consequences you brought upon your head However she said nothing to that purpose she even said something to a different purpose mister Rokesmith it seems so long since we spoke together naturally that I am embarrassed in approaching another subject mister Boffin You know I am very grateful to him don t you You know I feel a true respect for him and am bound to him by the strong ties of his own generosity now don t you Unquestionably And also that you are his favourite companion That makes it said Bella so very difficult to speak of him But Does he treat you well You see how he treats me the Secretary answered with a patient and yet proud air Yes and I see it with pain said Bella very energetically The Secretary gave her such a radiant look that if he had thanked her a hundred times he could not have said as much as the look said I see it with pain repeated Bella and it often makes me miserable Miserable because I cannot bear to be supposed to approve of it or have any indirect share in it Miserable because I cannot bear to be forced to admit to myself that Fortune is spoiling mister Boffin Miss Wilfer said the Secretary with a beaming face if you could know with what delight I make the discovery that Fortune isn t spoiling YOU you would know that it more than compensates me for any slight at any other hands Oh don t speak of ME said Bella giving herself an impatient little slap with her glove You don t know me as well as As you know yourself suggested the Secretary finding that she stopped DO you know yourself I know quite enough of myself said Bella with a charming air of being inclined to give herself up as a bad job and I don t improve upon acquaintance But mister Boffin That mister Boffin s manner to me or consideration for me is not what it used to be observed the Secretary must be admitted It is too plain to be denied Are you disposed to deny it mister Rokesmith asked Bella with a look of wonder Ought I not to be glad to do so if I could though it were only for my own sake Truly returned Bella it must try you very much and you must please promise me that you won t take ill what I am going to add mister Rokesmith I promise it with all my heart And it must sometimes I should think said Bella hesitating a little lower you in your own estimation Assenting with a movement of his head though not at all looking as if it did the Secretary replied I have very strong reasons Miss Wilfer for bearing with the drawbacks of my position in the house we both inhabit Believe that they are not all mercenary although I have through a series of strange fatalities faded out of my place in life If what you see with such a gracious and good sympathy is calculated to rouse my pride there are other considerations and those you do not see urging me to quiet endurance The latter are by far the stronger I think I have noticed mister Rokesmith said Bella looking at him with curiosity as not quite making him out that you repress yourself and force yourself to act a passive part You are right I repress myself and force myself to act a part It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit I have a settled purpose And a good one I hope said Bella And a good one I hope he answered looking steadily at her Sometimes I have fancied sir said Bella turning away her eyes that your great regard for missus Boffin is a very powerful motive with you You are right again it is I would do anything for her bear anything for her There are no words to express how I esteem that good good woman As I do too May I ask you one thing more mister Rokesmith Anything more Of course you see that she really suffers when mister Boffin shows how he is changing I see it every day as you see it and am grieved to give her pain To give her pain said Bella repeating the phrase quickly with her eyebrows raised I am generally the unfortunate cause of it Perhaps she says to you as she often says to me that he is the best of men in spite of all I often overhear her in her honest and beautiful devotion to him saying so to you returned the Secretary with the same steady look but I cannot assert that she ever says so to me Bella met the steady look for a moment with a wistful musing little look of her own and then nodding her pretty head several times like a dimpled philosopher of the very best school who was moralizing on Life heaved a little sigh and gave up things in general for a bad job as she had previously been inclined to give up herself But for all that they had a very pleasant walk The trees were bare of leaves and the river was bare of water lilies but the sky was not bare of its beautiful blue and the water reflected it and a delicious wind ran with the stream touching the surface crisply Perhaps the old mirror was never yet made by human hands which if all the images it has in its time reflected could pass across its surface again would fail to reveal some scene of horror or distress But the great serene mirror of the river seemed as if it might have reproduced all it had ever reflected between those placid banks and brought nothing to the light save what was peaceful pastoral and blooming So they walked speaking of the newly filled up grave and of Johnny and of many things So on their return they met brisk missus Milvey coming to seek them with the agreeable intelligence that there was no fear for the village children there being a Christian school in the village and no worse Judaical interference with it than to plant its garden So they got back to the village as Lizzie Hexam was coming from the paper mill and Bella detached herself to speak with her in her own home I am afraid it is a poor room for you said Lizzie with a smile of welcome as she offered the post of honour by the fireside Not so poor as you think my dear returned Bella if you knew all Indeed though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs which seemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney and though very low in the ceiling and very rugged in the floor and rather blinking as to the proportions of its lattice window it was a pleasanter room than that despised chamber once at home in which Bella had first bemoaned the miseries of taking lodgers The day was closing as the two girls looked at one another by the fireside The dusky room was lighted by the fire The grate might have been the old brazier and the glow might have been the old hollow down by the flare It s quite new to me said Lizzie to be visited by a lady so nearly of my own age and so pretty as you It s a pleasure to me to look at you I have nothing left to begin with returned Bella blushing because I was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you Lizzie But we can begin without a beginning can t we Lizzie took the pretty little hand that was held out in as pretty a little frankness Now dear said Bella drawing her chair a little nearer and taking Lizzie s arm as if they were going out for a walk I am commissioned with something to say and I dare say I shall say it wrong but I won t if I can help it It is in reference to your letter to mister and missus Boffin and this is what it is Let me see Oh yes This is what it is With this exordium Bella set forth that request of Lizzie s touching secrecy and delicately spoke of that false accusation and its retraction and asked might she beg to be informed whether it had any bearing near or remote on such request I feel my dear said Bella quite amazing herself by the business like manner in which she was getting on that the subject must be a painful one to you but I am mixed up in it also for I don t know whether you may know it or suspect it I am the willed away girl who was to have been married to the unfortunate gentleman if he had been pleased to approve of me So I was dragged into the subject without my consent and you were dragged into it without your consent and there is very little to choose between us I had no doubt said Lizzie that you were the Miss Wilfer I have often heard named Can you tell me who my unknown friend is Unknown friend my dear said Bella Who caused the charge against poor father to be contradicted and sent me the written paper Bella had never heard of him Had no notion who he was I should have been glad to thank him returned Lizzie He has done a great deal for me I must hope that he will let me thank him some day You asked me has it anything to do It or the accusation itself Bella put in Yes Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and retired here No As Lizzie Hexam shook her head in giving this reply and as her glance sought the fire there was a quiet resolution in her folded hands not lost on Bella s bright eyes Have you lived much alone asked Bella Yes It s nothing new to me I used to be always alone many hours together in the day and in the night when poor father was alive You have a brother I have been told I have a brother but he is not friendly with me He is a very good boy though and has raised himself by his industry I don t complain of him As she said it with her eyes upon the fire glow there was an instantaneous escape of distress into her face Bella seized the moment to touch her hand Lizzie I wish you would tell me whether you have any friend of your own sex and age I have lived that lonely kind of life that I have never had one was the answer Nor I neither said Bella Not that my life has been lonely for I could have sometimes wished it lonelier instead of having Ma going on like the Tragic Muse with a face ache in majestic corners and Lavvy being spiteful though of course I am very fond of them both I wish you could make a friend of me Lizzie Do you think you could I have no more of what they call character my dear than a canary bird but I know I am trustworthy The wayward playful affectionate nature giddy for want of the weight of some sustaining purpose and capricious because it was always fluttering among little things was yet a captivating one To Lizzie it was so new so pretty at once so womanly and so childish that it won her completely And when Bella said again Do you think you could Lizzie with her eyebrows raised her head inquiringly on one side and an odd doubt about it in her own bosom Lizzie showed beyond all question that she thought she could Tell me my dear said Bella what is the matter and why you live like this Lizzie presently began by way of prelude You must have many lovers when Bella checked her with a little scream of astonishment My dear I haven t one Not one Well Perhaps one said Bella I am sure I don t know I HAD one but what he may think about it at the present time I can t say Perhaps I have half a one of course I don t count that Idiot George Sampson However never mind me I want to hear about you There is a certain man said Lizzie a passionate and angry man who says he loves me and who I must believe does love me He is the friend of my brother I shrank from him within myself when my brother first brought him to me but the last time I saw him he terrified me more than I can say There she stopped Did you come here to escape from him Lizzie I came here immediately after he so alarmed me Are you afraid of him here I am not timid generally but I am always afraid of him I am afraid to see a newspaper or to hear a word spoken of what is done in London lest he should have done some violence Then you are not afraid of him for yourself dear said Bella after pondering on the words I should be even that if I met him about here I look round for him always as I pass to and fro at night Are you afraid of anything he may do to himself in London my dear No He might be fierce enough even to do some violence to himself but I don t think of that Then it would almost seem dear said Bella quaintly as if there must be somebody else Lizzie put her hands before her face for a moment before replying The words are always in my ears and the blow he struck upon a stone wall as he said them is always before my eyes I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering but I cannot make so little of it His hand was trickling down with blood as he said to me Then I hope that I may never kill him Rather startled Bella made and clasped a girdle of her arms round Lizzie s waist and then asked quietly in a soft voice as they both looked at the fire Kill him Is this man so jealous then Of a gentleman said Lizzie I hardly know how to tell you of a gentleman far above me and my way of life who broke father s death to me and has shown an interest in me since Does he love you Lizzie shook her head Does he admire you Lizzie ceased to shake her head and pressed her hand upon her living girdle Is it through his influence that you came here O no And of all the world I wouldn t have him know that I am here or get the least clue where to find me Lizzie dear Why asked Bella in amazement at this burst But then quickly added reading Lizzie s face No Don t say why That was a foolish question of mine I see I see There was silence between them Lizzie with a drooping head glanced down at the glow in the fire where her first fancies had been nursed and her first escape made from the grim life out of which she had plucked her brother foreseeing her reward You know all now she said raising her eyes to Bella s There is nothing left out This is my reason for living secret here with the aid of a good old man who is my true friend For a short part of my life at home with father I knew of things don t ask me what that I set my face against and tried to better I don t think I could have done more then without letting my hold on father go but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind By doing all for the best I hope I may wear them out And wear out too said Bella soothingly this weakness Lizzie in favour of one who is not worthy of it No I don t want to wear that out was the flushed reply nor do I want to believe nor do I believe that he is not worthy of it What should I gain by that and how much should I lose Bella s expressive little eyebrows remonstrated with the fire for some short time before she rejoined Don t think that I press you Lizzie but wouldn t you gain in peace and hope and even in freedom Wouldn t it be better not to live a secret life in hiding and not to be shut out from your natural and wholesome prospects Forgive my asking you would that be no gain Does a woman s heart that that has that weakness in it which you have spoken of returned Lizzie seek to gain anything The question was so directly at variance with Bella s views in life as set forth to her father that she said internally There you little mercenary wretch Do you hear that Ain t you ashamed of your self and unclasped the girdle of her arms expressly to give herself a penitential poke in the side But you said Lizzie observed Bella returning to her subject when she had administered this chastisement that you would lose besides Would you mind telling me what you would lose Lizzie I should lose some of the best recollections best encouragements and best objects that I carry through my daily life I should lose my belief that if I had been his equal and he had loved me I should have tried with all my might to make him better and happier as he would have made me I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little learning I have which is all owing to him and which I conquered the difficulties of that he might not think it thrown away upon me I should lose a kind of picture of him or of what he might have been if I had been a lady and he had loved me which is always with me and which I somehow feel that I could not do a mean or a wrong thing before I should leave off prizing the remembrance that he has done me nothing but good since I have known him and that he has made a change within me like like the change in the grain of these hands which were coarse and cracked and hard and brown when I rowed on the river with father and are softened and made supple by this new work as you see them now They trembled but with no weakness as she showed them Understand me my dear thus she went on I have never dreamed of the possibility of his being anything to me on this earth but the kind picture that I know I could not make you understand if the understanding was not in your own breast already I have no more dreamed of the possibility of MY being his wife than he ever has and words could not be stronger than that And yet I love him I love him so much and so dearly that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary one I am proud of it and glad of it I am proud and glad to suffer something for him even though it is of no service to him and he will never know of it or care for it Bella sat enchained by the deep unselfish passion of this girl or woman of her own age courageously revealing itself in the confidence of her sympathetic perception of its truth And yet she had never experienced anything like it or thought of the existence of anything like it It was late upon a wretched night said Lizzie when his eyes first looked at me in my old river side home very different from this His eyes may never look at me again I would rather that they never did I hope that they never may But I would not have the light of them taken out of my life for anything my life can give me I have told you everything now my dear If it comes a little strange to me to have parted with it I am not sorry I had no thought of ever parting with a single word of it a moment before you came in but you came in and my mind changed Bella kissed her on the cheek and thanked her warmly for her confidence I only wish said Bella I was more deserving of it More deserving of it repeated Lizzie with an incredulous smile I don t mean in respect of keeping it said Bella because any one should tear me to bits before getting at a syllable of it though there s no merit in that for I am naturally as obstinate as a Pig What I mean is Lizzie that I am a mere impertinent piece of conceit and you shame me Lizzie put up the pretty brown hair that came tumbling down owing to the energy with which Bella shook her head and she remonstrated while thus engaged My dear Oh it s all very well to call me your dear said Bella with a pettish whimper and I am glad to be called so though I have slight enough claim to be But I AM such a nasty little thing My dear urged Lizzie again Such a shallow cold worldly Limited little brute said Bella bringing out her last adjective with culminating force Do you think inquired Lizzie with her quiet smile the hair being now secured that I don t know better DO you know better though said Bella Do you really believe you know better Oh I should be so glad if you did know better but I am so very much afraid that I must know best Lizzie asked her laughing outright whether she ever saw her own face or heard her own voice I suppose so returned Bella I look in the glass often enough and I chatter like a Magpie I have seen your face and heard your voice at any rate said Lizzie and they have tempted me to say to you with a certainty of not going wrong what I thought I should never say to any one Does that look ill No I hope it doesn t pouted Bella stopping herself in something between a humoured laugh and a humoured sob I used once to see pictures in the fire said Lizzie playfully to please my brother Shall I tell you what I see down there where the fire is glowing They had risen and were standing on the hearth the time being come for separating each had drawn an arm around the other to take leave Shall I tell you asked Lizzie what I see down there Limited little b suggested Bella with her eyebrows raised A heart well worth winning and well won A heart that once won goes through fire and water for the winner and never changes and is never daunted Girl s heart asked Bella with accompanying eyebrows Lizzie nodded And the figure to which it belongs Is yours suggested Bella No Most clearly and distinctly yours So the interview terminated with pleasant words on both sides and with many reminders on the part of Bella that they were friends and pledges that she would soon come down into that part of the country again There with Lizzie returned to her occupation and Bella ran over to the little inn to rejoin her company You look rather serious Miss Wilfer was the Secretary s first remark I feel rather serious returned Miss Wilfer She had nothing else to tell him but that Lizzie Hexam s secret had no reference whatever to the cruel charge or its withdrawal Oh yes though said Bella she might as well mention one other thing Lizzie was very desirous to thank her unknown friend who had sent her the written retractation Was she indeed observed the Secretary Ah Bella asked him had he any notion who that unknown friend might be He had no notion whatever They were on the borders of Oxfordshire so far had poor old Betty Higden strayed They were to return by the train presently and the station being near at hand the Reverend Frank and missus Frank and Sloppy and Bella and the Secretary set out to walk to it Few rustic paths are wide enough for five and Bella and the Secretary dropped behind Can you believe mister Rokesmith said Bella that I feel as if whole years had passed since I went into Lizzie Hexam s cottage We have crowded a good deal into the day he returned and you were much affected in the churchyard You are over tired No I am not at all tired I have not quite expressed what I mean I don t mean that I feel as if a great space of time had gone by but that I feel as if much had happened to myself you know For good I hope I hope so said Bella You are cold I felt you tremble Pray let me put this wrapper of mine about you May I fold it over this shoulder without injuring your dress Now it will be too heavy and too long Let me carry this end over my arm as you have no arm to give me Yes she had though How she got it out in her muffled state Heaven knows but she got it out somehow there it was and slipped it through the Secretary s I have had a long and interesting talk with Lizzie mister Rokesmith and she gave me her full confidence She could not withhold it said the Secretary I wonder how you come said Bella stopping short as she glanced at him to say to me just what she said about it I infer that it must be because I feel just as she felt about it And how was that do you mean to say sir asked Bella moving again That if you were inclined to win her confidence anybody s confidence you were sure to do it The railway at this point knowingly shutting a green eye and opening a red one they had to run for it As Bella could not run easily so wrapped up the Secretary had to help her When she took her opposite place in the carriage corner the brightness in her face was so charming to behold that on her exclaiming What beautiful stars and what a glorious night the Secretary said Yes but seemed to prefer to see the night and the stars in the light of her lovely little countenance to looking out of window O boofer lady fascinating boofer lady If I were but legally executor of Johnny s will If I had but the right to pay your legacy and to take your receipt Something to this purpose surely mingled with the blast of the train as it cleared the stations all knowingly shutting up their green eyes and opening their red ones when they prepared to let the boofer lady pass Chapter ten SCOUTS OUT And so Miss Wren said mister Eugene Wrayburn I cannot persuade you to dress me a doll No replied Miss Wren snappishly if you want one go and buy one at the shop And my charming young goddaughter said mister Wrayburn plaintively down in Hertfordshire Humbugshire you mean I think interposed Miss Wren is to be put upon the cold footing of the general public and is to derive no advantage from my private acquaintance with the Court Dressmaker If it s any advantage to your charming godchild and oh a precious godfather she has got replied Miss Wren pricking at him in the air with her needle to be informed that the Court Dressmaker knows your tricks and your manners you may tell her so by post with my compliments Miss Wren was busy at her work by candle light and mister Wrayburn half amused and half vexed and all idle and shiftless stood by her bench looking on Miss Wren s troublesome child was in the corner in deep disgrace and exhibiting great wretchedness in the shivering stage of prostration from drink Ugh you disgraceful boy exclaimed Miss Wren attracted by the sound of his chattering teeth I wish they d all drop down your throat and play at dice in your stomach Boh wicked child Bee baa black sheep On her accompanying each of these reproaches with a threatening stamp of the foot the wretched creature protested with a whine Pay five shillings for you indeed Miss Wren proceeded how many hours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings you infamous boy Don t cry like that or I ll throw a doll at you Pay five shillings fine for you indeed Fine in more ways than one I think I d give the dustman five shillings to carry you off in the dust cart No no pleaded the absurd creature Please He s enough to break his mother s heart is this boy said Miss Wren half appealing to Eugene I wish I had never brought him up He d be sharper than a serpent s tooth if he wasn t as dull as ditch water Look at him There s a pretty object for a parent s eyes Assuredly in his worse than swinish state for swine at least fatten on their guzzling and make themselves good to eat he was a pretty object for any eyes A muddling and a swipey old child said Miss Wren rating him with great severity fit for nothing but to be preserved in the liquor that destroys him and put in a great glass bottle as a sight for other swipey children of his own pattern if he has no consideration for his liver has he none for his mother Yes Deration oh don t cried the subject of these angry remarks Oh don t and oh don t pursued Miss Wren It s oh do and oh do And why do you Won t do so any more Won t indeed Pray There said Miss Wren covering her eyes with her hand I can t bear to look at you Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl Make yourself useful in some way bad boy and let me have your room instead of your company for one half minute Obeying her he shambled out and Eugene Wrayburn saw the tears exude from between the little creature s fingers as she kept her hand before her eyes He was sorry but his sympathy did not move his carelessness to do anything but feel sorry I m going to the Italian Opera to try on said Miss Wren taking away her hand after a little while and laughing satirically to hide that she had been crying I must see your back before I go mister Wrayburn Let me first tell you once for all that it s of no use your paying visits to me You wouldn t get what you want of me no not if you brought pincers with you to tear it out Are you so obstinate on the subject of a doll s dress for my godchild Ah returned Miss Wren with a hitch of her chin I am so obstinate And of course it s on the subject of a doll s dress or ADdress whichever you like Get along and give it up Her degraded charge had come back and was standing behind her with the bonnet and shawl Give em to me and get back into your corner you naughty old thing said Miss Wren as she turned and espied him No no I won t have your help Go into your corner this minute The miserable man feebly rubbing the back of his faltering hands downward from the wrists shuffled on to his post of disgrace but not without a curious glance at Eugene in passing him accompanied with what seemed as if it might have been an action of his elbow if any action of any limb or joint he had would have answered truly to his will Taking no more particular notice of him than instinctively falling away from the disagreeable contact Eugene with a lazy compliment or so to Miss Wren begged leave to light his cigar and departed Now you prodigal old son said Jenny shaking her head and her emphatic little forefinger at her burden you sit there till I come back You dare to move out of your corner for a single instant while I m gone and I ll know the reason why With this admonition she blew her work candles out leaving him to the light of the fire and taking her big door key in her pocket and her crutch stick in her hand marched off Eugene lounged slowly towards the Temple smoking his cigar but saw no more of the dolls dressmaker through the accident of their taking opposite sides of the street He lounged along moodily and stopped at Charing Cross to look about him with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take and was lounging on again when a most unexpected object caught his eyes No less an object than Jenny Wren s bad boy trying to make up his mind to cross the road A more ridiculous and feeble spectacle than this tottering wretch making unsteady sallies into the roadway and as often staggering back again oppressed by terrors of vehicles that were a long way off or were nowhere the streets could not have shown Over and over again when the course was perfectly clear he set out got half way described a loop turned and went back again when he might have crossed and re crossed half a dozen times Then he would stand shivering on the edge of the pavement looking up the street and looking down while scores of people jostled him and crossed and went on Stimulated in course of time by the sight of so many successes he would make another sally make another loop would all but have his foot on the opposite pavement would see or imagine something coming and would stagger back again There he would stand making spasmodic preparations as if for a great leap and at last would decide on a start at precisely the wrong moment and would be roared at by drivers and would shrink back once more and stand in the old spot shivering with the whole of the proceedings to go through again It strikes me remarked Eugene coolly after watching him for some minutes that my friend is likely to be rather behind time if he has any appointment on hand With which remark he strolled on and took no further thought of him Lightwood was at home when he got to the Chambers and had dined alone there Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine and reading the evening paper and brought a glass and filled it for good fellowship s sake My dear Mortimer you are the express picture of contented industry reposing on credit after the virtuous labours of the day My dear Eugene you are the express picture of discontented idleness not reposing at all Where have you been I have been replied Wrayburn about town I have turned up at the present juncture with the intention of consulting my highly intelligent and respected solicitor on the position of my affairs Your highly intelligent and respect solicitor is of opinion that your affairs are in a bad way Eugene Though whether said Eugene thoughtfully that can be intelligently said now of the affairs of a client who has nothing to lose and who cannot possibly be made to pay may be open to question You have fallen into the hands of the Jews Eugene My dear boy returned the debtor very composedly taking up his glass having previously fallen into the hands of some of the Christians I can bear it with philosophy I have had an interview to day Eugene with a Jew who seems determined to press us hard Quite a Shylock and quite a Patriarch A picturesque grey headed and grey bearded old Jew in a shovel hat and gaberdine Not said Eugene pausing in setting down his glass surely not my worthy friend mister Aaron He calls himself mister Riah By the by said Eugene it comes into my mind that no doubt with an instinctive desire to receive him into the bosom of our Church I gave him the name of Aaron Eugene Eugene returned Lightwood you are more ridiculous than usual Say what you mean Merely my dear fellow that I have the honour and pleasure of a speaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe and that I address him as mister Aaron because it appears to me Hebraic expressive appropriate and complimentary Notwithstanding which strong reasons for its being his name it may not be his name I believe you are the absurdest man on the face of the earth said Lightwood laughing Not at all I assure you Did he mention that he knew me He did not He only said of you that he expected to be paid by you Which looks remarked Eugene with much gravity like NOT knowing me I hope it may not be my worthy friend mister Aaron for to tell you the truth Mortimer I doubt he may have a prepossession against me I strongly suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie Everything returned Lightwood impatiently seems by a fatality to bring us round to Lizzie About town meant about Lizzie just now Eugene My solicitor do you know observed Eugene turning round to the furniture is a man of infinite discernment Did it not Eugene Yes it did Mortimer And yet Eugene you know you do not really care for her Eugene Wrayburn rose and put his hands in his pockets and stood with a foot on the fender indolently rocking his body and looking at the fire After a prolonged pause he replied I don t know that I must ask you not to say that as if we took it for granted But if you do care for her so much the more should you leave her to herself Having again paused as before Eugene said I don t know that either But tell me Did you ever see me take so much trouble about anything as about this disappearance of hers I ask for information My dear Eugene I wish I ever had Then you have not Just so You confirm my own impression Does that look as if I cared for her I ask for information I asked YOU for information Eugene said Mortimer reproachfully Dear boy I know it but I can t give it I thirst for information What do I mean If my taking so much trouble to recover her does not mean that I care for her what does it mean If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper where s the peck c Though he said this gaily he said it with a perplexed and inquisitive face as if he actually did not know what to make of himself Look on to the end Lightwood was beginning to remonstrate when he caught at the words Ah See now That s exactly what I am incapable of doing How very acute you are Mortimer in finding my weak place When we were at school together I got up my lessons at the last moment day by day and bit by bit now we are out in life together I get up my lessons in the same way In the present task I have not got beyond this I am bent on finding Lizzie and I mean to find her and I will take any means of finding her that offer themselves Fair means or foul means are all alike to me I ask you for information what does that mean When I have found her I may ask you also for information what do I mean now But it would be premature in this stage and it s not the character of my mind Lightwood was shaking his head over the air with which his friend held forth thus an air so whimsically open and argumentative as almost to deprive what he said of the appearance of evasion when a shuffling was heard at the outer door and then an undecided knock as though some hand were groping for the knocker The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood said Eugene whom I should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard below without any intermediate ceremonies have probably turned the lamp out I am on duty to night and will see to the door His friend had barely had time to recall the unprecedented gleam of determination with which he had spoken of finding this girl and which had faded out of him with the breath of the spoken words when Eugene came back ushering in a most disgraceful shadow of a man shaking from head to foot and clothed in shabby grease and smear This interesting gentleman said Eugene is the son the occasionally rather trying son for he has his failings of a lady of my acquaintance My dear Mortimer mister Dolls Eugene had no idea what his name was knowing the little dressmaker s to be assumed but presented him with easy confidence under the first appellation that his associations suggested I gather my dear Mortimer pursued Eugene as Lightwood stared at the obscene visitor from the manner of mister Dolls which is occasionally complicated that he desires to make some communication to me I have mentioned to mister Dolls that you and I are on terms of confidence and have requested mister Dolls to develop his views here The wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained of his hat Eugene airily tossed it to the door and put him down in a chair It will be necessary I think he observed to wind up mister Dolls before anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him Brandy mister Dolls or Threepenn orth Rum said mister Dolls A judiciously small quantity of the spirit was given him in a wine glass and he began to convey it to his mouth with all kinds of falterings and gyrations on the road The nerves of mister Dolls remarked Eugene to Lightwood are considerably unstrung And I deem it on the whole expedient to fumigate mister Dolls He took the shovel from the grate sprinkled a few live ashes on it and from a box on the chimney piece took a few pastiles which he set upon them then with great composure began placidly waving the shovel in front of mister Dolls to cut him off from his company Lord bless my soul Eugene cried Lightwood laughing again what a mad fellow you are Why does this creature come to see you We shall hear said Wrayburn very observant of his face withal Now then Speak out Don t be afraid State your business Dolls Mist Wrayburn said the visitor thickly and huskily TIS Mist Wrayburn ain t With a stupid stare Of course it is Look at me What do you want mister Dolls collapsed in his chair and faintly said Threepenn orth Rum Will you do me the favour my dear Mortimer to wind up mister Dolls again said Eugene I am occupied with the fumigation A similar quantity was poured into his glass and he got it to his lips by similar circuitous ways Having drunk it mister Dolls with an evident fear of running down again unless he made haste proceeded to business Mist Wrayburn Tried to nudge you but you wouldn t You want that drection You want t know where she lives DO you Mist Wrayburn With a glance at his friend Eugene replied to the question sternly I do I am er man said mister Dolls trying to smite himself on the breast but bringing his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye er do it I am er man er do it What are you the man to do demanded Eugene still sternly Er give up that drection Have you got it With a most laborious attempt at pride and dignity mister Dolls rolled his head for some time awakening the highest expectations and then answered as if it were the happiest point that could possibly be expected of him No What do you mean then mister Dolls collapsing in the drowsiest manner after his late intellectual triumph replied Threepenn orth Rum Wind him up again my dear Mortimer said Wrayburn wind him up again Eugene Eugene urged Lightwood in a low voice as he complied can you stoop to the use of such an instrument as this I said was the reply made with that former gleam of determination that I would find her out by any means fair or foul These are foul and I ll take them if I am not first tempted to break the head of mister Dolls with the fumigator Can you get the direction Do you mean that Speak If that s what you have come for say how much you want Ten shillings Threepenn orths Rum said mister Dolls You shall have it Fifteen shillings Threepenn orths Rum said mister Dolls making an attempt to stiffen himself You shall have it Stop at that How will you get the direction you talk of I am er man said mister Dolls with majesty er get it sir How will you get it I ask you I am ill used vidual said mister Dolls Blown up morning t night Called names She makes Mint money sir and never stands Threepenn orth Rum Get on rejoined Eugene tapping his palsied head with the fire shovel as it sank on his breast What comes next Making a dignified attempt to gather himself together but as it were dropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain to pick up one mister Dolls swaying his head from side to side regarded his questioner with what he supposed to be a haughty smile and a scornful glance She looks upon me as mere child sir I am NOT mere child sir Man Man talent Lerrers pass betwixt em Postman lerrers Easy for man talent er get drection as get his own drection Get it then said Eugene adding very heartily under his breath You Brute Get it and bring it here to me and earn the money for sixty threepenn orths of rum and drink them all one a top of another and drink yourself dead with all possible expedition The latter clauses of these special instructions he addressed to the fire as he gave it back the ashes he had taken from it and replaced the shovel mister Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been insulted by Lightwood and stated his desire to have it out with him on the spot and defied him to come on upon the liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny mister Dolls then fell a crying and then exhibited a tendency to fall asleep This last manifestation as by far the most alarming by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises necessitated vigorous measures Eugene picked up his worn out hat with the tongs clapped it on his head and taking him by the collar all this at arm s length conducted him down stairs and out of the precincts into Fleet Street There he turned his face westward and left him When he got back Lightwood was standing over the fire brooding in a sufficiently low spirited manner I ll wash my hands of mister Dolls physically said Eugene and be with you again directly Mortimer I would much prefer retorted Mortimer your washing your hands of mister Dolls morally Eugene So would I said Eugene but you see dear boy I can t do without him In a minute or two he resumed his chair as perfectly unconcerned as usual and rallied his friend on having so narrowly escaped the prowess of their muscular visitor I can t be amused on this theme said Mortimer restlessly You can make almost any theme amusing to me Eugene but not this Well cried Eugene I am a little ashamed of it myself and therefore let us change the subject It is so deplorably underhanded said Mortimer It is so unworthy of you this setting on of such a shameful scout We have changed the subject exclaimed Eugene airily We have found a new one in that word scout Don t be like Patience on a mantelpiece frowning at Dolls but sit down and I ll tell you something that you really will find amusing Take a cigar Look at this of mine I light it draw one puff breathe the smoke out there it goes it s Dolls it s gone and being gone you are a man again Your subject said Mortimer after lighting a cigar and comforting himself with a whiff or two was scouts Eugene Exactly Isn t it droll that I never go out after dark but I find myself attended always by one scout and often by two Lightwood took his cigar from his lips in surprise and looked at his friend as if with a latent suspicion that there must be a jest or hidden meaning in his words On my honour no said Wrayburn answering the look and smiling carelessly I don t wonder at your supposing so but on my honour no I say what I mean I never go out after dark but I find myself in the ludicrous situation of being followed and observed at a distance always by one scout and often by two Are you sure Eugene Sure My dear boy they are always the same But there s no process out against you The Jews only threaten They have done nothing Besides they know where to find you and I represent you Why take the trouble Observe the legal mind remarked Eugene turning round to the furniture again with an air of indolent rapture Observe the dyer s hand assimilating itself to what it works in or would work in if anybody would give it anything to do Respected solicitor it s not that The schoolmaster s abroad The schoolmaster Ay Sometimes the schoolmaster and the pupil are both abroad Why how soon you rust in my absence You don t understand yet Those fellows who were here one night They are the scouts I speak of as doing me the honour to attend me after dark How long has this been going on asked Lightwood opposing a serious face to the laugh of his friend I apprehend it has been going on ever since a certain person went off Probably it had been going on some little time before I noticed it which would bring it to about that time Do you think they suppose you to have inveigled her away My dear Mortimer you know the absorbing nature of my professional occupations I really have not had leisure to think about it Have you asked them what they want Have you objected Why should I ask them what they want dear fellow when I am indifferent what they want Why should I express objection when I don t object You are in your most reckless mood But you called the situation just now a ludicrous one and most men object to that even those who are utterly indifferent to everything else You charm me Mortimer with your reading of my weaknesses By the by that very word Reading in its critical use always charms me An actress s Reading of a chambermaid a dancer s Reading of a hornpipe a singer s Reading of a song a marine painter s Reading of the sea the kettle drum s Reading of an instrumental passage are phrases ever youthful and delightful I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses I own to the weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous position and therefore I transfer the position to the scouts I wish Eugene you would speak a little more soberly and plainly if it were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than you do Then soberly and plainly Mortimer I goad the schoolmaster to madness I make the schoolmaster so ridiculous and so aware of being made ridiculous that I see him chafe and fret at every pore when we cross one another The amiable occupation has been the solace of my life since I was baulked in the manner unnecessary to recall I have derived inexpressible comfort from it I do it thus I stroll out after dark stroll a little way look in at a window and furtively look out for the schoolmaster Sooner or later I perceive the schoolmaster on the watch sometimes accompanied by his hopeful pupil oftener pupil less Having made sure of his watching me I tempt him on all over London One night I go east another night north in a few nights I go all round the compass Sometimes I walk sometimes I proceed in cabs draining the pocket of the schoolmaster who then follows in cabs I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day With Venetian mystery I seek those No Thoroughfares at night glide into them by means of dark courts tempt the schoolmaster to follow turn suddenly and catch him before he can retreat Then we face one another and I pass him as unaware of his existence and he undergoes grinding torments Similarly I walk at a great pace down a short street rapidly turn the corner and getting out of his view as rapidly turn back I catch him coming on post again pass him as unaware of his existence and again he undergoes grinding torments Night after night his disappointment is acute but hope springs eternal in the scholastic breast and he follows me again to morrow Thus I enjoy the pleasures of the chase and derive great benefit from the healthful exercise When I do not enjoy the pleasures of the chase for anything I know he watches at the Temple Gate all night This is an extraordinary story observed Lightwood who had heard it out with serious attention I don t like it You are a little hipped dear fellow said Eugene you have been too sedentary Come and enjoy the pleasures of the chase Do you mean that you believe he is watching now I have not the slightest doubt he is Have you seen him to night I forgot to look for him when I was last out returned Eugene with the calmest indifference but I dare say he was there Come Be a British sportsman and enjoy the pleasures of the chase It will do you good Lightwood hesitated but yielding to his curiosity rose Bravo cried Eugene rising too Or if Yoicks would be in better keeping consider that I said Yoicks Look to your feet Mortimer for we shall try your boots When you are ready I am need I say with a Hey Ho Chivey and likewise with a Hark Forward Hark Forward Tantivy Will nothing make you serious said Mortimer laughing through his gravity I am always serious but just now I am a little excited by the glorious fact that a southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting evening Ready So We turn out the lamp and shut the door and take the field As the two friends passed out of the Temple into the public street Eugene demanded with a show of courteous patronage in which direction Mortimer would you like the run to be There is a rather difficult country about Bethnal Green said Eugene and we have not taken in that direction lately What is your opinion of Bethnal Green Mortimer assented to Bethnal Green and they turned eastward Now when we come to saint Paul s churchyard pursued Eugene we ll loiter artfully and I ll show you the schoolmaster But they both saw him before they got there alone and stealing after them in the shadow of the houses on the opposite side of the way Get your wind said Eugene for I am off directly Does it occur to you that the boys of Merry England will begin to deteriorate in an educational light if this lasts long The schoolmaster can t attend to me and the boys too Got your wind I am off At what a rate he went to breathe the schoolmaster and how he then lounged and loitered to put his patience to another kind of wear what preposterous ways he took with no other object on earth than to disappoint and punish him and how he wore him out by every piece of ingenuity that his eccentric humour could devise all this Lightwood noted with a feeling of astonishment that so careless a man could be so wary and that so idle a man could take so much trouble At last far on in the third hour of the pleasures of the chase when he had brought the poor dogging wretch round again into the City he twisted Mortimer up a few dark entries twisted him into a little square court twisted him sharp round again and they almost ran against Bradley Headstone And you see as I was saying Mortimer remarked Eugene aloud with the utmost coolness as though there were no one within hearing by themselves and you see as I was saying undergoing grinding torments It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion Looking like the hunted and not the hunter baffled worn with the exhaustion of deferred hope and consuming hate and anger in his face white lipped wild eyed draggle haired seamed with jealousy and anger and torturing himself with the conviction that he showed it all and they exulted in it he went by them in the dark like a haggard head suspended in the air so completely did the force of his expression cancel his figure Mortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man but this face impressed him He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home and more than once when they got home They had been abed in their respective rooms two or three hours when Eugene was partly awakened by hearing a footstep going about and was fully awakened by seeing Lightwood standing at his bedside Nothing wrong Mortimer No What fancy takes you then for walking about in the night I am horribly wakeful How comes that about I wonder Eugene I cannot lose sight of that fellow s face Odd said Eugene with a light laugh I can And turned over and fell asleep again Chapter eleven IN THE DARK There was no sleep for Bradley Headstone on that night when Eugene Wrayburn turned so easily in his bed there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher Bradley consumed the lonely hours and consumed himself in haunting the spot where his careless rival lay a dreaming little Miss Peecher wore them away in listening for the return home of the master of her heart and in sorrowfully presaging that much was amiss with him Yet more was amiss with him than Miss Peecher s simply arranged little work box of thoughts fitted with no gloomy and dark recesses could hold For the state of the man was murderous The state of the man was murderous and he knew it More he irritated it with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body Tied up all day with his disciplined show upon him subdued to the performance of his routine of educational tricks encircled by a gabbling crowd he broke loose at night like an ill tamed wild animal Under his daily restraint it was his compensation not his trouble to give a glance towards his state at night and to the freedom of its being indulged If great criminals told the truth which being great criminals they do not they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime Their struggles are towards it They buffet with opposing waves to gain the bloody shore not to recede from it This man perfectly comprehended that he hated his rival with his strongest and worst forces and that if he tracked him to Lizzie Hexam his so doing would never serve himself with her or serve her All his pains were taken to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour in her place of concealment And he knew as well what act of his would follow if he did as he knew that his mother had borne him Granted that he may not have held it necessary to make express mention to himself of the one familiar truth any more than of the other He knew equally well that he fed his wrath and hatred and that he accumulated provocation and self justification by being made the nightly sport of the reckless and insolent Eugene Knowing all this and still always going on with infinite endurance pains and perseverance could his dark soul doubt whither he went Baffled exasperated and weary he lingered opposite the Temple gate when it closed on Wrayburn and Lightwood debating with himself should he go home for that time or should he watch longer Possessed in his jealousy by the fixed idea that Wrayburn was in the secret if it were not altogether of his contriving Bradley was as confident of getting the better of him at last by sullenly sticking to him as he would have been and often had been of mastering any piece of study in the way of his vocation by the like slow persistent process A man of rapid passions and sluggish intelligence it had served him often and should serve him again The suspicion crossed him as he rested in a doorway with his eyes upon the Temple gate that perhaps she was even concealed in that set of Chambers It would furnish another reason for Wrayburn s purposeless walks and it might be He thought of it and thought of it until he resolved to steal up the stairs if the gatekeeper would let him through and listen So the haggard head suspended in the air flitted across the road like the spectre of one of the many heads erst hoisted upon neighbouring Temple Bar and stopped before the watchman The watchman looked at it and asked Who for mister Wrayburn It s very late He came back with mister Lightwood I know near upon two hours ago But if he has gone to bed I ll put a paper in his letter box I am expected The watchman said no more but opened the gate though rather doubtfully Seeing however that the visitor went straight and fast in the right direction he seemed satisfied The haggard head floated up the dark staircase and softly descended nearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers The doors of the rooms within appeared to be standing open There were rays of candlelight from one of them and there was the sound of a footstep going about There were two voices The words they uttered were not distinguishable but they were both the voices of men In a few moments the voices were silent and there was no sound of footstep and the inner light went out If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept him awake staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as he spoke of it he might have been less disposed to sleep through the remainder of the night Not there said Bradley but she might have been The head arose to its former height from the ground floated down the stair case again and passed on to the gate A man was standing there in parley with the watchman Oh said the watchman Here he is Perceiving himself to be the antecedent Bradley looked from the watchman to the man This man is leaving a letter for mister Lightwood the watchman explained showing it in his hand and I was mentioning that a person had just gone up to mister Lightwood s chambers It might be the same business perhaps No said Bradley glancing at the man who was a stranger to him No the man assented in a surly way my letter it s wrote by my daughter but it s mine is about my business and my business ain t nobody else s business As Bradley passed out at the gate with an undecided foot he heard it shut behind him and heard the footstep of the man coming after him Scuse me said the man who appeared to have been drinking and rather stumbled at him than touched him to attract his attention but might you be acquainted with the T other Governor With whom asked Bradley With returned the man pointing backward over his right shoulder with his right thumb the T other Governor I don t know what you mean Why look here hooking his proposition on his left hand fingers with the forefinger of his right There s two Governors ain t there One and one two Lawyer Lightwood my first finger he s one ain t he Well might you be acquainted with my middle finger the T other I know quite as much of him said Bradley with a frown and a distant look before him as I want to know Hooroar cried the man Hooroar T other t other Governor Hooroar T otherest Governor I am of your way of thinkin Don t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night What are you talking about Look here T otherest Governor replied the man becoming hoarsely confidential The T other Governor he s always joked his jokes agin me owing as I believe to my being a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow Which he ain t and he don t What is that to me T otherest Governor returned the man in a tone of injured innocence if you don t care to hear no more don t hear no more You begun it You said and likeways showed pretty plain as you warn t by no means friendly to him But I don t seek to force my company nor yet my opinions on no man I am a honest man that s what I am Put me in the dock anywhere I don t care where and I says My Lord I am a honest man Put me in the witness box anywhere I don t care where and I says the same to his lordship and I kisses the book I don t kiss my coat cuff I kisses the book It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which he was concentrated that Bradley Headstone replied You needn t take offence I didn t mean to stop you You were too loud in the open street that was all Totherest Governor replied mister Riderhood mollified and mysterious I know wot it is to be loud and I know wot it is to be soft Nat rally I do It would be a wonder if I did not being by the Chris en name of Roger which took it arter my own father which took it from his own father though which of our fam ly fust took it nat ral I will not in any ways mislead you by undertakin to say And wishing that your elth may be better than your looks which your inside must be bad indeed if it s on the footing of your out Startled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind Bradley made an effort to clear his brow It might be worth knowing what this strange man s business was with Lightwood or Wrayburn or both at such an unseasonable hour He set himself to find out for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two You call at the Temple late he remarked with a lumbering show of ease Wish I may die cried mister Riderhood with a hoarse laugh if I warn t a goin to say the self same words to you T otherest Governor It chanced so with me said Bradley looking disconcertedly about him And it chanced so with me said Riderhood But I don t mind telling you how Why should I mind telling you I m a Deputy Lock keeper up the river and I was off duty yes day and I shall be on to morrow Yes Yes and I come to London to look arter my private affairs My private affairs is to get appinted to the Lock as reg lar keeper at fust hand and to have the law of a busted B low Bridge steamer which drownded of me I ain t a goin to be drownded and not paid for it Bradley looked at him as though he were claiming to be a Ghost The steamer said mister Riderhood obstinately run me down and drownded of me Interference on the part of other parties brought me round but I never asked em to bring me round nor yet the steamer never asked em to it I mean to be paid for the life as the steamer took Was that your business at mister Lightwood s chambers in the middle of the night asked Bradley eyeing him with distrust That and to get a writing to be fust hand Lock Keeper A recommendation in writing being looked for who else ought to give it to me As I says in the letter in my daughter s hand with my mark put to it to make it good in law Who but you Lawyer Lightwood ought to hand over this here stifficate and who but you ought to go in for damages on my account agin the Steamer For as I says under my mark I have had trouble enough along of you and your friend If you Lawyer Lightwood had backed me good and true and if the T other Governor had took me down correct I says under my mark I should have been worth money at the present time instead of having a barge load of bad names chucked at me and being forced to eat my words which is a unsatisfying sort of food wotever a man s appetite And when you mention the middle of the night T otherest Governor growled mister Riderhood winding up his monotonous summary of his wrongs throw your eye on this here bundle under my arm and bear in mind that I m a walking back to my Lock and that the Temple laid upon my line of road Bradley Headstone s face had changed during this latter recital and he had observed the speaker with a more sustained attention Do you know said he after a pause during which they walked on side by side that I believe I could tell you your name if I tried Prove your opinion was the answer accompanied with a stop and a stare Try Your name is Riderhood I m blest if it ain t returned that gentleman But I don t know your n That s quite another thing said Bradley I never supposed you did As Bradley walked on meditating the Rogue walked on at his side muttering The purport of the muttering was that Rogue Riderhood by George seemed to be made public property on now and that every man seemed to think himself free to handle his name as if it was a Street Pump The purport of the meditating was Here is an instrument Can I use it They had walked along the Strand and into Pall Mall and had turned up hill towards Hyde Park Corner Bradley Headstone waiting on the pace and lead of Riderhood and leaving him to indicate the course So slow were the schoolmaster s thoughts and so indistinct his purposes when they were but tributary to the one absorbing purpose or rather when like dark trees under a stormy sky they only lined the long vista at the end of which he saw those two figures of Wrayburn and Lizzie on which his eyes were fixed that at least a good half mile was traversed before he spoke again Even then it was only to ask Where is your Lock Twenty mile and odd call it five and twenty mile and odd if you like up stream was the sullen reply How is it called Plashwater Weir Mill Lock Suppose I was to offer you five shillings what then Why then I d take it said mister Riderhood The schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket and produced two half crowns and placed them in mister Riderhood s palm who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring them both before acknowledging their receipt There s one thing about you T otherest Governor said Riderhood faring on again as looks well and goes fur You re a ready money man Now when he had carefully pocketed the coins on that side of himself which was furthest from his new friend what s this for For you Why o course I know THAT said Riderhood as arguing something that was self evident O course I know very well as no man in his right senses would suppose as anythink would make me give it up agin when I d once got it But what do you want for it I don t know that I want anything for it Or if I do want anything for it I don t know what it is Bradley gave this answer in a stolid vacant and self communing manner which mister Riderhood found very extraordinary You have no goodwill towards this Wrayburn said Bradley coming to the name in a reluctant and forced way as if he were dragged to it No Neither have I Riderhood nodded and asked Is it for that It s as much for that as anything else It s something to be agreed with on a subject that occupies so much of one s thoughts It don t agree with YOU returned mister Riderhood bluntly No It don t T otherest Governor and it s no use a lookin as if you wanted to make out that it did I tell you it rankles in you It rankles in you rusts in you and pisons you Say that it does so returned Bradley with quivering lips is there no cause for it Cause enough I ll bet a pound cried mister Riderhood Haven t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations insults and affronts on you or something to that effect He has done the same by me He is made of venomous insults and affronts from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot Are you so hopeful or so stupid as not to know that he and the other will treat your application with contempt and light their cigars with it I shouldn t wonder if they did by George said Riderhood turning angry If they did They will Let me ask you a question I know something more than your name about you I knew something about Gaffer Hexam When did you last set eyes upon his daughter When did I last set eyes upon his daughter T otherest Governor repeated mister Riderhood growing intentionally slower of comprehension as the other quickened in his speech Yes Not to speak to her To see her anywhere The Rogue had got the clue he wanted though he held it with a clumsy hand Looking perplexedly at the passionate face as if he were trying to work out a sum in his mind he slowly answered I ain t set eyes upon her never once not since the day of Gaffer s death You know her well by sight I should think I did No one better And you know him as well Who s him asked Riderhood taking off his hat and rubbing his forehead as he directed a dull look at his questioner Curse the name Is it so agreeable to you that you want to hear it again Oh HIM said Riderhood who had craftily worked the schoolmaster into this corner that he might again take note of his face under its evil possession I d know HIM among a thousand Did you Bradley tried to ask it quietly but do what he might with his voice he could not subdue his face did you ever see them together The Rogue had got the clue in both hands now I see em together T otherest Governor on the very day when Gaffer was towed ashore Bradley could have hidden a reserved piece of information from the sharp eyes of a whole inquisitive class but he could not veil from the eyes of the ignorant Riderhood the withheld question next in his breast You shall put it plain if you want it answered thought the Rogue doggedly I ain t a going a wolunteering Well was he insolent to her too asked Bradley after a struggle Or did he make a show of being kind to her He made a show of being most uncommon kind to her said Riderhood By George now I His flying off at a tangent was indisputably natural Bradley looked at him for the reason Now I think of it said mister Riderhood evasively for he was substituting those words for Now I see you so jealous which was the phrase really in his mind P r aps he went and took me down wrong a purpose on account o being sweet upon her The baseness of confirming him in this suspicion or pretence of one for he could not have really entertained it was a line s breadth beyond the mark the schoolmaster had reached The baseness of communing and intriguing with the fellow who would have set that stain upon her and upon her brother too was attained The line s breadth further lay beyond He made no reply but walked on with a lowering face What he might gain by this acquaintance he could not work out in his slow and cumbrous thoughts The man had an injury against the object of his hatred and that was something though it was less than he supposed for there dwelt in the man no such deadly rage and resentment as burned in his own breast The man knew her and might by a fortunate chance see her or hear of her that was something as enlisting one pair of eyes and ears the more The man was a bad man and willing enough to be in his pay That was something for his own state and purpose were as bad as bad could be and he seemed to derive a vague support from the possession of a congenial instrument though it might never be used Suddenly he stood still and asked Riderhood point blank if he knew where she was Clearly he did not know He asked Riderhood if he would be willing in case any intelligence of her or of Wrayburn as seeking her or associating with her should fall in his way to communicate it if it were paid for He would be very willing indeed He was agin em both he said with an oath and for why Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow It will not be long then said Bradley Headstone after some more discourse to this effect before we see one another again Here is the country road and here is the day Both have come upon me by surprise But T otherest Governor urged mister Riderhood I don t know where to find you It is of no consequence I know where to find you and I ll come to your Lock But T otherest Governor urged mister Riderhood again no luck never come yet of a dry acquaintance Let s wet it in a mouth fill of rum and milk T otherest Governor Bradley assenting went with him into an early public house haunted by unsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw where returning carts farmers men gaunt dogs fowls of a beery breed and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost were solacing themselves after their several manners and where not one of the nightbirds hovering about the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion wasted nightbird with respectable feathers the worst nightbird of all An inspiration of affection for a half drunken carter going his way led to mister Riderhood s being elevated on a high heap of baskets on a waggon and pursuing his journey recumbent on his back with his head on his bundle Bradley then turned to retrace his steps and by and by struck off through little traversed ways and by and by reached school and home Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat decent formal black tie and pepper and salt pantaloons with his decent silver watch in its pocket and its decent hair guard round his neck a scholastic huntsman clad for the field with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him Yet more really bewitched than the miserable creatures of the much lamented times who accused themselves of impossibilities under a contagion of horror and the strongly suggestive influences of Torture he had been ridden hard by Evil Spirits in the night that was newly gone He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated If a record of the sport had usurped the places of the peaceful texts from Scripture on the wall the most advanced of the scholars might have taken fright and run away from the master Chapter twelve MEANING MISCHIEF Up came the sun steaming all over London and in its glorious impartiality even condescending to make prismatic sparkles in the whiskers of mister Alfred Lammle as he sat at breakfast In need of some brightening from without was mister Alfred Lammle for he had the air of being dull enough within and looked grievously discontented missus Alfred Lammle faced her lord The happy pair of swindlers with the comfortable tie between them that each had swindled the other sat moodily observant of the tablecloth Things looked so gloomy in the breakfast room albeit on the sunny side of Sackville Street that any of the family tradespeople glancing through the blinds might have taken the hint to send in his account and press for it But this indeed most of the family tradespeople had already done without the hint It seems to me said missus Lammle that you have had no money at all ever since we have been married What seems to you said mister Lammle to have been the case may possibly have been the case It doesn t matter Was it the speciality of mister and missus Lammle or does it ever obtain with other loving couples In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them Perhaps the skeleton in the cupboard comes out to be talked to on such domestic occasions I have never seen any money in the house said missus Lammle to the skeleton except my own annuity That I swear You needn t take the trouble of swearing said mister Lammle to the skeleton once more it doesn t matter You never turned your annuity to so good an account Good an account In what way asked missus Lammle In the way of getting credit and living well said mister Lammle Perhaps the skeleton laughed scornfully on being intrusted with this question and this answer certainly missus Lammle did and mister Lammle did And what is to happen next asked missus Lammle of the skeleton Smash is to happen next said mister Lammle to the same authority After this missus Lammle looked disdainfully at the skeleton but without carrying the look on to mister Lammle and drooped her eyes After that mister Lammle did exactly the same thing and drooped HIS eyes A servant then entering with toast the skeleton retired into the closet and shut itself up Sophronia said mister Lammle when the servant had withdrawn And then very much louder Sophronia Well Attend to me if you please He eyed her sternly until she did attend and then went on I want to take counsel with you Come come no more trifling You know our league and covenant We are to work together for our joint interest and you are as knowing a hand as I am We shouldn t be together if you were not What s to be done We are hemmed into a corner What shall we do Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything mister Lammle plunged into his whiskers for reflection and came out hopeless No as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for chances of high winnings and there has been a run of luck against us She was resuming Have you nothing when he stopped her We Sophronia We we we Have we nothing to sell Deuce a bit I have given a Jew a bill of sale on this furniture and he could take it to morrow to day now He would have taken it before now I believe but for Fledgeby What has Fledgeby to do with him Knew him Cautioned me against him before I got into his claws Couldn t persuade him then in behalf of somebody else Do you mean that Fledgeby has at all softened him towards you Us Sophronia Us us us Towards us I mean that the Jew has not yet done what he might have done and that Fledgeby takes the credit of having got him to hold his hand Do you believe Fledgeby Sophronia I never believe anybody I never have my dear since I believed you But it looks like it Having given her this back handed reminder of her mutinous observations to the skeleton mister Lammle rose from table perhaps the better to conceal a smile and a white dint or two about his nose and took a turn on the carpet and came to the hearthrug If we could have packed the brute off with Georgiana but however that s spilled milk As Lammle standing gathering up the skirts of his dressing gown with his back to the fire said this looking down at his wife she turned pale and looked down at the ground With a sense of disloyalty upon her and perhaps with a sense of personal danger for she was afraid of him even afraid of his hand and afraid of his foot though he had never done her violence she hastened to put herself right in his eyes If we could borrow money Alfred Beg money borrow money or steal money It would be all one to us Sophronia her husband struck in Then we could weather this No doubt To offer another original and undeniable remark Sophronia two and two make four But seeing that she was turning something in her mind he gathered up the skirts of his dressing gown again and tucking them under one arm and collecting his ample whiskers in his other hand kept his eye upon her silently It is natural Alfred she said looking up with some timidity into his face to think in such an emergency of the richest people we know and the simplest Just so Sophronia The Boffins Just so Sophronia Is there nothing to be done with them What is there to be done with them Sophronia She cast about in her thoughts again and he kept his eye upon her as before Of course I have repeatedly thought of the Boffins Sophronia he resumed after a fruitless silence but I have seen my way to nothing They are well guarded That infernal Secretary stands between them and people of merit If he could be got rid of said she brightening a little after more casting about Take time Sophronia observed her watchful husband in a patronizing manner If working him out of the way could be presented in the light of a service to mister Boffin Take time Sophronia We have remarked lately Alfred that the old man is turning very suspicious and distrustful Miserly too my dear which is far the most unpromising for us Nevertheless take time Sophronia take time She took time and then said Suppose we should address ourselves to that tendency in him of which we have made ourselves quite sure Suppose my conscience And we know what a conscience it is my soul Yes Suppose my conscience should not allow me to keep to myself any longer what that upstart girl told me of the Secretary s having made a declaration to her Suppose my conscience should oblige me to repeat it to mister Boffin I rather like that said Lammle Suppose I so repeated it to mister Boffin as to insinuate that my sensitive delicacy and honour Very good words Sophronia As to insinuate that OUR sensitive delicacy and honour she resumed with a bitter stress upon the phrase would not allow us to be silent parties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary s part and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer Suppose I had imparted my virtuous uneasiness to my excellent husband and he had said in his integrity Sophronia you must immediately disclose this to mister Boffin Once more Sophronia observed Lammle changing the leg on which he stood I rather like that You remark that he is well guarded she pursued I think so too But if this should lead to his discharging his Secretary there would be a weak place made Go on expounding Sophronia I begin to like this very much Having in our unimpeachable rectitude done him the service of opening his eyes to the treachery of the person he trusted we shall have established a claim upon him and a confidence with him Whether it can be made much of or little of we must wait because we can t help it to see Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made Probably said Lammle Do you think it impossible she asked in the same cold plotting way that you might replace the Secretary Not impossible Sophronia It might be brought about At any rate it might be skilfully led up to She nodded her understanding of the hint as she looked at the fire mister Lammle she said musingly not without a slight ironical touch mister Lammle would be so delighted to do anything in his power mister Lammle himself a man of business as well as a capitalist mister Lammle accustomed to be intrusted with the most delicate affairs mister Lammle who has managed my own little fortune so admirably but who to be sure began to make his reputation with the advantage of being a man of property above temptation and beyond suspicion mister Lammle smiled and even patted her on the head In his sinister relish of the scheme as he stood above her making it the subject of his cogitations he seemed to have twice as much nose on his face as he had ever had in his life He stood pondering and she sat looking at the dusty fire without moving for some time But the moment he began to speak again she looked up with a wince and attended to him as if that double dealing of hers had been in her mind and the fear were revived in her of his hand or his foot It appears to me Sophronia that you have omitted one branch of the subject Perhaps not for women understand women We might oust the girl herself missus Lammle shook her head She has an immensely strong hold upon them both Alfred Not to be compared with that of a paid secretary But the dear child said Lammle with a crooked smile ought to have been open with her benefactor and benefactress The darling love ought to have reposed unbounded confidence in her benefactor and benefactress Sophronia shook her head again Well Women understand women said her husband rather disappointed I don t press it It might be the making of our fortune to make a clean sweep of them both With me to manage the property and my wife to manage the people Whew Again shaking her head she returned They will never quarrel with the girl They will never punish the girl We must accept the girl rely upon it Well cried Lammle shrugging his shoulders so be it only always remember that we don t want her Now the sole remaining question is said missus Lammle when shall I begin You cannot begin too soon Sophronia As I have told you the condition of our affairs is desperate and may be blown upon at any moment I must secure mister Boffin alone Alfred If his wife was present she would throw oil upon the waters I know I should fail to move him to an angry outburst if his wife was there And as to the girl herself as I am going to betray her confidence she is equally out of the question It wouldn t do to write for an appointment said Lammle No certainly not They would wonder among themselves why I wrote and I want to have him wholly unprepared Call and ask to see him alone suggested Lammle I would rather not do that either Leave it to me Spare me the little carriage for to day and for to morrow if I don t succeed to day and I ll lie in wait for him It was barely settled when a manly form was seen to pass the windows and heard to knock and ring Here s Fledgeby said Lammle He admires you and has a high opinion of you I ll be out Coax him to use his influence with the Jew His name is Riah of the House of Pubsey and company Adding these words under his breath lest he should be audible in the erect ears of mister Fledgeby through two keyholes and the hall Lammle making signals of discretion to his servant went softly up stairs mister Fledgeby said missus Lammle giving him a very gracious reception so glad to see you My poor dear Alfred who is greatly worried just now about his affairs went out rather early Dear mister Fledgeby do sit down Dear mister Fledgeby did sit down and satisfied himself or judging from the expression of his countenance DISsatisfied himself that nothing new had occurred in the way of whisker sprout since he came round the corner from the Albany Dear mister Fledgeby it was needless to mention to you that my poor dear Alfred is much worried about his affairs at present for he has told me what a comfort you are to him in his temporary difficulties and what a great service you have rendered him Oh said mister Fledgeby Yes said missus Lammle I didn t know remarked mister Fledgeby trying a new part of his chair but that Lammle might be reserved about his affairs Not to me said missus Lammle with deep feeling Oh indeed said Fledgeby Not to me dear mister Fledgeby I am his wife Yes I I always understood so said mister Fledgeby And as the wife of Alfred may I dear mister Fledgeby wholly without his authority or knowledge as I am sure your discernment will perceive entreat you to continue that great service and once more use your well earned influence with mister Riah for a little more indulgence The name I have heard Alfred mention tossing in his dreams IS Riah is it not The name of the Creditor is Riah said mister Fledgeby with a rather uncompromising accent on his noun substantive Saint Mary Axe Pubsey and company Oh yes exclaimed missus Lammle clasping her hands with a certain gushing wildness Pubsey and company The pleading of the feminine mister Fledgeby began and there stuck so long for a word to get on with that missus Lammle offered him sweetly Heart No said mister Fledgeby Gender is ever what a man is bound to listen to and I wish it rested with myself But this Riah is a nasty one missus Lammle he really is Not if YOU speak to him dear mister Fledgeby Upon my soul and body he is said Fledgeby Try Try once more dearest mister Fledgeby What is there you cannot do if you will Thank you said Fledgeby you re very complimentary to say so I don t mind trying him again at your request But of course I can t answer for the consequences Riah is a tough subject and when he says he ll do a thing he ll do it Exactly so cried missus Lammle and when he says to you he ll wait he ll wait She is a devilish clever woman thought Fledgeby I didn t see that opening but she spies it out and cuts into it as soon as it s made In point of fact dear mister Fledgeby missus Lammle went on in a very interesting manner not to affect concealment of Alfred s hopes to you who are so much his friend there is a distant break in his horizon This figure of speech seemed rather mysterious to Fascination Fledgeby who said There s a what in his eh Alfred dear mister Fledgeby discussed with me this very morning before he went out some prospects he has which might entirely change the aspect of his present troubles Really said Fledgeby O yes Here missus Lammle brought her handkerchief into play And you know dear mister Fledgeby you who study the human heart and study the world what an affliction it would be to lose position and to lose credit when ability to tide over a very short time might save all appearances Oh said Fledgeby Then you think missus Lammle that if Lammle got time he wouldn t burst up To use an expression mister Fledgeby apologetically explained which is adopted in the Money Market Indeed yes Truly truly yes That makes all the difference said Fledgeby I ll make a point of seeing Riah at once Blessings on you dearest mister Fledgeby Not at all said Fledgeby She gave him her hand The hand said mister Fledgeby of a lovely and superior minded female is ever the repayment of a Noble action said missus Lammle extremely anxious to get rid of him It wasn t what I was going to say returned Fledgeby who never would under any circumstances accept a suggested expression but you re very complimentary May I imprint a a one upon it Good morning I may depend upon your promptitude dearest mister Fledgeby Said Fledgeby looking back at the door and respectfully kissing his hand You may depend upon it In fact mister Fledgeby sped on his errand of mercy through the streets at so brisk a rate that his feet might have been winged by all the good spirits that wait on Generosity They might have taken up their station in his breast too for he was blithe and merry There was quite a fresh trill in his voice when arriving at the counting house in saint Mary Axe and finding it for the moment empty he trolled forth at the foot of the staircase Now Judah what are you up to there The old man appeared with his accustomed deference Halloa said Fledgeby falling back with a wink You mean mischief Jerusalem The old man raised his eyes inquiringly Yes you do said Fledgeby Oh you sinner Oh you dodger What You re going to act upon that bill of sale at Lammle s are you Nothing will turn you won t it You won t be put off for another single minute won t you Ordered to immediate action by the master s tone and look the old man took up his hat from the little counter where it lay You have been told that he might pull through it if you didn t go in to win Wide Awake have you said Fledgeby And it s not your game that he should pull through it ain t it You having got security and there being enough to pay you Oh you Jew The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve Do I go sir he at length asked in a low voice Asks me if he is going exclaimed Fledgeby Asks me as if he didn t know his own purpose Asks me as if he hadn t got his hat on ready Asks me as if his sharp old eye why it cuts like a knife wasn t looking at his walking stick by the door Do I go sir Do you go sneered Fledgeby Yes you do go Toddle Judah Chapter thirteen GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME AND HANG HIM Fascination Fledgeby left alone in the counting house strolled about with his hat on one side whistling and investigating the drawers and prying here and there for any small evidences of his being cheated but could find none Not his merit that he don t cheat me was mister Fledgeby s commentary delivered with a wink but my precaution He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of Pubsey and company by poking his cane at the stools and boxes and spitting in the fireplace and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the narrow street with his small eyes just peering over the top of Pubsey and company s blind As a blind in more senses than one it reminded him that he was alone in the counting house with the front door open He was moving away to shut it lest he should be injudiciously identified with the establishment when he was stopped by some one coming to the door This some one was the dolls dressmaker with a little basket on her arm and her crutch stick in her hand Her keen eyes had espied mister Fledgeby before mister Fledgeby had espied her and he was paralysed in his purpose of shutting her out not so much by her approaching the door as by her favouring him with a shower of nods the instant he saw her This advantage she improved by hobbling up the steps with such despatch that before mister Fledgeby could take measures for her finding nobody at home she was face to face with him in the counting house Hope I see you well sir said Miss Wren mister Riah in Fledgeby had dropped into a chair in the attitude of one waiting wearily I suppose he will be back soon he replied he has cut out and left me expecting him back in an odd way Haven t I seen you before Once before if you had your eyesight replied Miss Wren the conditional clause in an under tone When you were carrying on some games up at the top of the house I remember How s your friend I have more friends than one sir I hope replied Miss Wren Which friend Never mind said mister Fledgeby shutting up one eye any of your friends all your friends Are they pretty tolerable Somewhat confounded Miss Wren parried the pleasantry and sat down in a corner behind the door with her basket in her lap By and by she said breaking a long and patient silence I beg your pardon sir but I am used to find mister Riah at this time and so I generally come at this time I only want to buy my poor little two shillings worth of waste Perhaps you ll kindly let me have it and I ll trot off to my work I let you have it said Fledgeby turning his head towards her for he had been sitting blinking at the light and feeling his cheek Why you don t really suppose that I have anything to do with the place or the business do you Suppose exclaimed Miss Wren He said that day you were the master The old cock in black said Riah said Why he d say anything Well but you said so too returned Miss Wren Or at least you took on like the master and didn t contradict him One of his dodges said mister Fledgeby with a cool and contemptuous shrug He s made of dodges He said to me Come up to the top of the house sir and I ll show you a handsome girl But I shall call you the master So I went up to the top of the house and he showed me the handsome girl very well worth looking at she was and I was called the master I don t know why I dare say he don t He loves a dodge for its own sake being added mister Fledgeby after casting about for an expressive phrase the dodgerest of all the dodgers Oh my head cried the dolls dressmaker holding it with both her hands as if it were cracking You can t mean what you say I can my little woman retorted Fledgeby and I do I assure you This repudiation was not only an act of deliberate policy on Fledgeby s part in case of his being surprised by any other caller but was also a retort upon Miss Wren for her over sharpness and a pleasant instance of his humour as regarded the old Jew He has got a bad name as an old Jew and he is paid for the use of it and I ll have my money s worth out of him This was Fledgeby s habitual reflection in the way of business and it was sharpened just now by the old man s presuming to have a secret from him though of the secret itself as annoying somebody else whom he disliked he by no means disapproved Miss Wren with a fallen countenance sat behind the door looking thoughtfully at the ground and the long and patient silence had again set in for some time when the expression of mister Fledgeby s face betokened that through the upper portion of the door which was of glass he saw some one faltering on the brink of the counting house Presently there was a rustle and a tap and then some more rustling and another tap Fledgeby taking no notice the door was at length softly opened and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in mister Riah said this visitor very politely I am waiting for him sir returned mister Fledgeby He went out and left me here I expect him back every minute Perhaps you had better take a chair The gentleman took a chair and put his hand to his forehead as if he were in a melancholy frame of mind mister Fledgeby eyed him aside and seemed to relish his attitude A fine day sir remarked Fledgeby The little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed reflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of mister Fledgeby s voice had died out of the counting house Then he started and said I beg your pardon sir I fear you spoke to me I said remarked Fledgeby a little louder than before it was a fine day I beg your pardon I beg your pardon Yes Again the little dried gentleman put his hand to his forehead and again mister Fledgeby seemed to enjoy his doing it When the gentleman changed his attitude with a sigh Fledgeby spake with a grin mister Twemlow I think The dried gentleman seemed much surprised Had the pleasure of dining with you at Lammle s said Fledgeby Even have the honour of being a connexion of yours An unexpected sort of place this to meet in but one never knows when one gets into the City what people one may knock up against I hope you have your health and are enjoying yourself There might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words on the other hand it might have been but the native grace of mister Fledgeby s manner mister Fledgeby sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool and his hat on mister Twemlow had uncovered on looking in at the door and remained so Now the conscientious Twemlow knowing what he had done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby was particularly disconcerted by this encounter He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be He felt himself bound to conduct himself stiffly towards Fledgeby and he made him a distant bow Fledgeby made his small eyes smaller in taking special note of his manner The dolls dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket holding her crutch stick between them and appearing to take no heed of anything He s a long time muttered mister Fledgeby looking at his watch What time may you make it mister Twemlow mister Twemlow made it ten minutes past twelve sir As near as a toucher assented Fledgeby I hope mister Twemlow your business here may be of a more agreeable character than mine Thank you sir said mister Twemlow Fledgeby again made his small eyes smaller as he glanced with great complacency at Twemlow who was timorously tapping the table with a folded letter What I know of mister Riah said Fledgeby with a very disparaging utterance of his name leads me to believe that this is about the shop for disagreeable business I have always found him the bitingest and tightest screw in London mister Twemlow acknowledged the remark with a little distant bow It evidently made him nervous So much so pursued Fledgeby that if it wasn t to be true to a friend nobody should catch me waiting here a single minute But if you have friends in adversity stand by them That s what I say and act up to The equitable Twemlow felt that this sentiment irrespective of the utterer demanded his cordial assent You are very right sir he rejoined with spirit You indicate the generous and manly course Glad to have your approbation returned Fledgeby It s a coincidence mister Twemlow here he descended from his perch and sauntered towards him that the friends I am standing by to day are the friends at whose house I met you The Lammles She s a very taking and agreeable woman Conscience smote the gentle Twemlow pale Yes he said She is And when she appealed to me this morning to come and try what I could do to pacify their creditor this mister Riah that I certainly have gained some little influence with in transacting business for another friend but nothing like so much as she supposes and when a woman like that spoke to me as her dearest mister Fledgeby and shed tears why what could I do you know Twemlow gasped Nothing but come Nothing but come And so I came But why said Fledgeby putting his hands in his pockets and counterfeiting deep meditation why Riah should have started up when I told him that the Lammles entreated him to hold over a Bill of Sale he has on all their effects and why he should have cut out saying he would be back directly and why he should have left me here alone so long I cannot understand The chivalrous Twemlow Knight of the Simple Heart was not in a condition to offer any suggestion He was too penitent too remorseful For the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action and he had done wrong He had secretly interposed against this confiding young man for no better real reason than because the young man s ways were not his ways But the confiding young man proceeded to heap coals of fire on his sensitive head I beg your pardon mister Twemlow you see I am acquainted with the nature of the affairs that are transacted here Is there anything I can do for you here You have always been brought up as a gentleman and never as a man of business another touch of possible impertinence in this place and perhaps you are but a poor man of business What else is to be expected I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man sir returned Twemlow and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way I really do not so much as clearly understand my position in the matter on which I am brought here But there are reasons which make me very delicate of accepting your assistance I am greatly greatly disinclined to profit by it I don t deserve it Good childish creature Condemned to a passage through the world by such narrow little dimly lighted ways and picking up so few specks or spots on the road Perhaps said Fledgeby you may be a little proud of entering on the topic having been brought up as a gentleman It s not that sir returned Twemlow it s not that I hope I distinguish between true pride and false pride I have no pride at all myself said Fledgeby and perhaps I don t cut things so fine as to know one from t other But I know this is a place where even a man of business needs his wits about him and if mine can be of any use to you here you re welcome to them You are very good said Twemlow faltering But I am most unwilling I don t you know proceeded Fledgeby with an ill favoured glance entertain the vanity of supposing that my wits could be of any use to you in society but they might be here You cultivate society and society cultivates you but mister Riah s not society In society mister Riah is kept dark eh mister Twemlow Twemlow much disturbed and with his hand fluttering about his forehead replied Quite true The confiding young man besought him to state his case The innocent Twemlow expecting Fledgeby to be astounded by what he should unfold and not for an instant conceiving the possibility of its happening every day but treating of it as a terrible phenomenon occurring in the course of ages related how that he had had a deceased friend a married civil officer with a family who had wanted money for change of place on change of post and how he Twemlow had given him his name with the usual but in the eyes of Twemlow almost incredible result that he had been left to repay what he had never had How in the course of years he had reduced the principal by trifling sums having said Twemlow always to observe great economy being in the enjoyment of a fixed income limited in extent and that depending on the munificence of a certain nobleman and had always pinched the full interest out of himself with punctual pinches How he had come in course of time to look upon this one only debt of his life as a regular quarterly drawback and no worse when his name had some way fallen into the possession of mister Riah who had sent him notice to redeem it by paying up in full in one plump sum or take tremendous consequences This with hazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to confess judgment as he recollected the phrase and how he had been carried to another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly unconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable circumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of and also a Madonna formed the sum and substance of mister Twemlow s narrative Through which stalked the shadow of the awful Snigsworth eyed afar off by money lenders as Security in the Mist and menacing Twemlow with his baronial truncheon To all mister Fledgeby listened with the modest gravity becoming a confiding young man who knew it all beforehand and when it was finished seriously shook his head I don t like mister Twemlow said Fledgeby I don t like Riah s calling in the principal If he s determined to call it in it must come But supposing sir said Twemlow downcast that it can t come Then retorted Fledgeby you must go you know Where asked Twemlow faintly To prison returned Fledgeby Whereat mister Twemlow leaned his innocent head upon his hand and moaned a little moan of distress and disgrace However said Fledgeby appearing to pluck up his spirits we ll hope it s not so bad as that comes to If you ll allow me I ll mention to mister Riah when he comes in who you are and I ll tell him you re my friend and I ll say my say for you instead of your saying it for yourself I may be able to do it in a more business like way You won t consider it a liberty I thank you again and again sir said Twemlow I am strong strongly disinclined to avail myself of your generosity though my helplessness yields For I cannot but feel that I to put it in the mildest form of speech that I have done nothing to deserve it Where CAN he be muttered Fledgeby referring to his watch again What CAN he have gone out for Did you ever see him mister Twemlow Never He is a thorough Jew to look at but he is a more thorough Jew to deal with He s worst when he s quiet If he s quiet I shall take it as a very bad sign Keep your eye upon him when he comes in and if he s quiet don t be hopeful Here he is He looks quiet With these words which had the effect of causing the harmless Twemlow painful agitation mister Fledgeby withdrew to his former post and the old man entered the counting house Why mister Riah said Fledgeby I thought you were lost The old man glancing at the stranger stood stock still He perceived that his master was leading up to the orders he was to take and he waited to understand them I really thought repeated Fledgeby slowly that you were lost mister Riah Why now I look at you but no you can t have done it no you can t have done it Hat in hand the old man lifted his head and looked distressfully at Fledgeby as seeking to know what new moral burden he was to bear You can t have rushed out to get the start of everybody else and put in that bill of sale at Lammle s said Fledgeby Say you haven t mister Riah Sir I have replied the old man in a low voice Oh my eye cried Fledgeby Tut tut tut Dear dear dear Well I knew you were a hard customer mister Riah but I never thought you were as hard as that Sir said the old man with great uneasiness I do as I am directed I am not the principal here I am but the agent of a superior and I have no choice no power Don t say so retorted Fledgeby secretly exultant as the old man stretched out his hands with a shrinking action of defending himself against the sharp construction of the two observers Don t play the tune of the trade mister Riah You ve a right to get in your debts if you re determined to do it but don t pretend what every one in your line regularly pretends At least don t do it to me Why should you mister Riah You know I know all about you The old man clasped the skirt of his long coat with his disengaged hand and directed a wistful look at Fledgeby And don t said Fledgeby don t I entreat you as a favour mister Riah be so devilish meek for I know what ll follow if you are Look here mister Riah This gentleman is mister Twemlow The Jew turned to him and bowed That poor lamb bowed in return polite and terrified I have made such a failure proceeded Fledgeby in trying to do anything with you for my friend Lammle that I ve hardly a hope of doing anything with you for my friend and connexion indeed mister Twemlow But I do think that if you would do a favour for anybody you would for me and I won t fail for want of trying and I ve passed my promise to mister Twemlow besides Now mister Riah here is mister Twemlow Always good for his interest always coming up to time always paying his little way Now why should you press mister Twemlow You can t have any spite against mister Twemlow Why not be easy with mister Twemlow The old man looked into Fledgeby s little eyes for any sign of leave to be easy with mister Twemlow but there was no sign in them mister Twemlow is no connexion of yours mister Riah said Fledgeby you can t want to be even with him for having through life gone in for a gentleman and hung on to his Family If mister Twemlow has a contempt for business what can it matter to you But pardon me interposed the gentle victim I have not I should consider it presumption There mister Riah said Fledgeby isn t that handsomely said Come Make terms with me for mister Twemlow The old man looked again for any sign of permission to spare the poor little gentleman No mister Fledgeby meant him to be racked I am very sorry mister Twemlow said Riah I have my instructions I am invested with no authority for diverging from them The money must be paid In full and slap down do you mean mister Riah asked Fledgeby to make things quite explicit In full sir and at once was Riah s answer mister Fledgeby shook his head deploringly at Twemlow and mutely expressed in reference to the venerable figure standing before him with eyes upon the ground What a Monster of an Israelite this is mister Riah said Fledgeby The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in mister Fledgeby s head with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming yet mister Riah it s of no use my holding back the fact There s a certain great party in the background in mister Twemlow s case and you know it I know it the old man admitted Now I ll put it as a plain point of business mister Riah Are you fully determined as a plain point of business either to have that said great party s security or that said great party s money Fully determined answered Riah as he read his master s face and learnt the book Not at all caring for and indeed as it seems to me rather enjoying said Fledgeby with peculiar unction the precious kick up and row that will come off between mister Twemlow and the said great party This required no answer and received none Poor mister Twemlow who had betrayed the keenest mental terrors since his noble kinsman loomed in the perspective rose with a sigh to take his departure I thank you very much sir he said offering Fledgeby his feverish hand You have done me an unmerited service Thank you thank you Don t mention it answered Fledgeby It s a failure so far but I ll stay behind and take another touch at mister Riah Do not deceive yourself mister Twemlow said the Jew then addressing him directly for the first time There is no hope for you You must expect no leniency here You must pay in full and you cannot pay too promptly or you will be put to heavy charges Trust nothing to me sir Money money money When he had said these words in an emphatic manner he acknowledged mister Twemlow s still polite motion of his head and that amiable little worthy took his departure in the lowest spirits Fascination Fledgeby was in such a merry vein when the counting house was cleared of him that he had nothing for it but to go to the window and lean his arms on the frame of the blind and have his silent laugh out with his back to his subordinate When he turned round again with a composed countenance his subordinate still stood in the same place and the dolls dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror Halloa cried mister Fledgeby you re forgetting this young lady mister Riah and she has been waiting long enough too Sell her her waste please and give her good measure if you can make up your mind to do the liberal thing for once He looked on for a time as the Jew filled her little basket with such scraps as she was used to buy but his merry vein coming on again he was obliged to turn round to the window once more and lean his arms on the blind There my Cinderella dear said the old man in a whisper and with a worn out look the basket s full now Bless you And get you gone Don t call me your Cinderella dear returned Miss Wren O you cruel godmother She shook that emphatic little forefinger of hers in his face at parting as earnestly and reproachfully as she had ever shaken it at her grim old child at home You are not the godmother at all said she You are the Wolf in the Forest the wicked Wolf And if ever my dear Lizzie is sold and betrayed I shall know who sold and betrayed her Chapter fourteen mister WEGG PREPARES A GRINDSTONE FOR mister BOFFIN S NOSE Having assisted at a few more expositions of the lives of Misers mister Venus became almost indispensable to the evenings at the Bower The circumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by Wegg or as it were another calculator to cast up the guineas found in teapots chimneys racks and mangers and other such banks of deposit seemed greatly to heighten mister Boffin s enjoyment while Silas Wegg for his part though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary circumstances have resented the anatomist s getting into favour was so very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman lest being too much left to himself he should be tempted to play any tricks with the precious document in his keeping that he never lost an opportunity of commending him to mister Boffin s notice as a third party whose company was much to be desired Another friendly demonstration towards him mister Wegg now regularly gratified After each sitting was over and the patron had departed mister Wegg invariably saw mister Venus home To be sure he as invariably requested to be refreshed with a sight of the paper in which he was a joint proprietor but he never failed to remark that it was the great pleasure he derived from mister Venus s improving society which had insensibly lured him round to Clerkenwell again and that finding himself once more attracted to the spot by the social powers of mister V he would beg leave to go through that little incidental procedure as a matter of form For well I know sir mister Wegg would add that a man of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the opportunity arises and it is not for me to baulk your feelings A certain rustiness in mister Venus which never became so lubricated by the oil of mister Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner was very noticeable at about this period While assisting at the literary evenings he even went so far on two or three occasions as to correct mister Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word or made nonsense of a passage insomuch that mister Wegg took to surveying his course in the day and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them Of the slightest anatomical reference he became particularly shy and if he saw a bone ahead would go any distance out of his way rather than mention it by name The adverse destinies ordained that one evening mister Wegg s labouring bark became beset by polysyllables and embarrassed among a perfect archipelago of hard words It being necessary to take soundings every minute and to feel the way with the greatest caution mister Wegg s attention was fully employed Advantage was taken of this dilemma by mister Venus to pass a scrap of paper into mister Boffin s hand and lay his finger on his own lip When mister Boffin got home at night he found that the paper contained mister Venus s card and these words Should be glad to be honoured with a call respecting business of your own about dusk on an early evening The very next evening saw mister Boffin peeping in at the preserved frogs in mister Venus s shop window and saw mister Venus espying mister Boffin with the readiness of one on the alert and beckoning that gentleman into his interior Responding mister Boffin was invited to seat himself on the box of human miscellanies before the fire and did so looking round the place with admiring eyes The fire being low and fitful and the dusk gloomy the whole stock seemed to be winking and blinking with both eyes as mister Venus did The French gentleman though he had no eyes was not at all behind hand but appeared as the flame rose and fell to open and shut his no eyes with the regularity of the glass eyed dogs and ducks and birds The big headed babies were equally obliging in lending their grotesque aid to the general effect You see mister Venus I ve lost no time said mister Boffin Here I am Here you are sir assented mister Venus I don t like secrecy pursued mister Boffin at least not in a general way I don t but I dare say you ll show me good reason for being secret so far I think I shall sir returned Venus Good said mister Boffin You don t expect Wegg I take it for granted No sir I expect no one but the present company mister Boffin glanced about him as accepting under that inclusive denomination the French gentleman and the circle in which he didn t move and repeated The present company Sir said mister Venus before entering upon business I shall have to ask you for your word and honour that we are in confidence Let s wait a bit and understand what the expression means answered mister Boffin In confidence for how long In confidence for ever and a day I take your hint sir said Venus you think you might consider the business when you came to know it to be of a nature incompatible with confidence on your part I might said mister Boffin with a cautious look True sir Well sir observed Venus after clutching at his dusty hair to brighten his ideas let us put it another way I open the business with you relying upon your honour not to do anything in it and not to mention me in it without my knowledge That sounds fair said mister Boffin I agree to that I have your word and honour sir My good fellow retorted mister Boffin you have my word and how you can have that without my honour too I don t know I ve sorted a lot of dust in my time but I never knew the two things go into separate heaps This remark seemed rather to abash mister Venus He hesitated and said Very true sir and again Very true sir before resuming the thread of his discourse mister Boffin if I confess to you that I fell into a proposal of which you were the subject and of which you oughtn t to have been the subject you will allow me to mention and will please take into favourable consideration that I was in a crushed state of mind at the time The Golden Dustman with his hands folded on the top of his stout stick with his chin resting upon them and with something leering and whimsical in his eyes gave a nod and said Quite so Venus That proposal sir was a conspiring breach of your confidence to such an extent that I ought at once to have made it known to you But I didn t mister Boffin and I fell into it Without moving eye or finger mister Boffin gave another nod and placidly repeated Quite so Venus Not that I was ever hearty in it sir the penitent anatomist went on or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having turned out of the paths of science into the paths of he was going to say villany but unwilling to press too hard upon himself substituted with great emphasis Weggery Placid and whimsical of look as ever mister Boffin answered Quite so Venus And now sir said Venus having prepared your mind in the rough I will articulate the details With which brief professional exordium he entered on the history of the friendly move and truly recounted it One might have thought that it would have extracted some show of surprise or anger or other emotion from mister Boffin but it extracted nothing beyond his former comment Quite so Venus I have astonished you sir I believe said mister Venus pausing dubiously mister Boffin simply answered as aforesaid Quite so Venus By this time the astonishment was all on the other side It did not however so continue For when Venus passed to Wegg s discovery and from that to their having both seen mister Boffin dig up the Dutch bottle that gentleman changed colour changed his attitude became extremely restless and ended when Venus ended by being in a state of manifest anxiety trepidation and confusion Now sir said Venus finishing off you best know what was in that Dutch bottle and why you dug it up and took it away I don t pretend to know anything more about it than I saw All I know is this I am proud of my calling after all though it has been attended by one dreadful drawback which has told upon my heart and almost equally upon my skeleton and I mean to live by my calling Putting the same meaning into other words I do not mean to turn a single dishonest penny by this affair As the best amends I can make you for having ever gone into it I make known to you as a warning what Wegg has found out My opinion is that Wegg is not to be silenced at a modest price and I build that opinion on his beginning to dispose of your property the moment he knew his power Whether it s worth your while to silence him at any price you will decide for yourself and take your measures accordingly As far as I am concerned I have no price If I am ever called upon for the truth I tell it but I want to do no more than I have now done and ended Thank ee Venus said mister Boffin with a hearty grip of his hand thank ee Venus thank ee Venus And then walked up and down the little shop in great agitation But look here Venus he by and by resumed nervously sitting down again if I have to buy Wegg up I shan t buy him any cheaper for your being out of it Instead of his having half the money it was to have been half I suppose Share and share alike It was to have been half sir answered Venus Instead of that he ll now have all I shall pay the same if not more For you tell me he s an unconscionable dog a ravenous rascal He is said Venus Don t you think Venus insinuated mister Boffin after looking at the fire for a while don t you feel as if you might like to pretend to be in it till Wegg was bought up and then ease your mind by handing over to me what you had made believe to pocket No I don t sir returned Venus very positively Not to make amends insinuated mister Boffin No sir It seems to me after maturely thinking it over that the best amends for having got out of the square is to get back into the square Humph mused mister Boffin When you say the square you mean I mean said Venus stoutly and shortly the right It appears to me said mister Boffin grumbling over the fire in an injured manner that the right is with me if it s anywhere I have much more right to the old man s money than the Crown can ever have What was the Crown to him except the King s Taxes Whereas me and my wife we was all in all to him mister Venus with his head upon his hands rendered melancholy by the contemplation of mister Boffin s avarice only murmured to steep himself in the luxury of that frame of mind She did not wish so to regard herself nor yet to be so regarded And how am I to live asked mister Boffin piteously if I m to be going buying fellows up out of the little that I ve got And how am I to set about it When am I to get my money ready When am I to make a bid You haven t told me when he threatens to drop down upon me Venus explained under what conditions and with what views the dropping down upon mister Boffin was held over until the Mounds should be cleared away mister Boffin listened attentively I suppose said he with a gleam of hope there s no doubt about the genuineness and date of this confounded will None whatever said mister Venus Where might it be deposited at present asked mister Boffin in a wheedling tone It s in my possession sir Is it he cried with great eagerness Now for any liberal sum of money that could be agreed upon Venus would you put it in the fire No sir I wouldn t interrupted mister Venus Nor pass it over to me That would be the same thing No sir said mister Venus The Golden Dustman seemed about to pursue these questions when a stumping noise was heard outside coming towards the door Hush here s Wegg said Venus Get behind the young alligator in the corner mister Boffin and judge him for yourself I won t light a candle till he s gone there ll only be the glow of the fire Wegg s well acquainted with the alligator and he won t take particular notice of him Draw your legs in mister Boffin at present I see a pair of shoes at the end of his tail Get your head well behind his smile mister Boffin and you ll lie comfortable there you ll find plenty of room behind his smile He s a little dusty but he s very like you in tone Are you right sir mister Boffin had but whispered an affirmative response when Wegg came stumping in Partner said that gentleman in a sprightly manner how s yourself Tolerable returned mister Venus Not much to boast of In deed said Wegg sorry partner that you re not picking up faster but your soul s too large for your body sir that s where it is And how s our stock in trade partner Safe bind safe find partner Is that about it Do you wish to see it asked Venus If you please partner said Wegg rubbing his hands I wish to see it jintly with yourself Or in similar words to some that was set to music some time back I wish you to see it with your eyes And I will pledge with mine Turning his back and turning a key mister Venus produced the document holding on by his usual corner mister Wegg holding on by the opposite corner sat down on the seat so lately vacated by mister Boffin and looked it over All right sir he slowly and unwillingly admitted in his reluctance to loose his hold all right And greedily watched his partner as he turned his back again and turned his key again There s nothing new I suppose said Venus resuming his low chair behind the counter Yes there is sir replied Wegg there was something new this morning That foxey old grasper and griper mister Boffin inquired Venus with a glance towards the alligator s yard or two of smile Mister be blowed cried Wegg yielding to his honest indignation Boffin Dusty Boffin That foxey old grunter and grinder sir turns into the yard this morning to meddle with our property a menial tool of his own a young man by the name of Sloppy Ecod when I say to him What do you want here young man This is a private yard he pulls out a paper from Boffin s other blackguard the one I was passed over for This is to authorize Sloppy to overlook the carting and to watch the work That s pretty strong I think mister Venus Remember he doesn t know yet of our claim on the property suggested Venus Then he must have a hint of it said Wegg and a strong one that ll jog his terrors a bit Give him an inch and he ll take an ell Let him alone this time and what ll he do with our property next I tell you what mister Venus it comes to this I must be overbearing with Boffin or I shall fly into several pieces I can t contain myself when I look at him Every time I see him putting his hand in his pocket I see him putting it into my pocket Every time I hear him jingling his money I hear him taking liberties with my money Flesh and blood can t bear it No said mister Wegg greatly exasperated and I ll go further A wooden leg can t bear it But mister Wegg urged Venus it was your own idea that he should not be exploded upon till the Mounds were carted away But it was likewise my idea mister Venus retorted Wegg that if he came sneaking and sniffing about the property he should be threatened given to understand that he has no right to it and be made our slave Wasn t that my idea mister Venus It certainly was mister Wegg It certainly was as you say partner assented Wegg put into a better humour by the ready admission Very well I consider his planting one of his menial tools in the yard an act of sneaking and sniffing And his nose shall be put to the grindstone for it It was not your fault mister Wegg I must admit said Venus that he got off with the Dutch bottle that night As you handsomely say again partner No it was not my fault I d have had that bottle out of him Was it to be borne that he should come like a thief in the dark digging among stuff that was far more ours than his seeing that we could deprive him of every grain of it if he didn t buy us at our own figure and carrying off treasure from its bowels No it was not to be borne And for that too his nose shall be put to the grindstone How do you propose to do it mister Wegg To put his nose to the grindstone I propose returned that estimable man to insult him openly And if looking into this eye of mine he dares to offer a word in answer to retort upon him before he can take his breath Add another word to that you dusty old dog and you re a beggar Suppose he says nothing mister Wegg Then replied Wegg we shall have come to an understanding with very little trouble and I ll break him and drive him mister Venus I ll put him in harness and I ll bear him up tight and I ll break him and drive him The harder the old Dust is driven sir the higher he ll pay And I mean to be paid high mister Venus I promise you You speak quite revengefully mister Wegg Revengefully sir Is it for him that I have declined and falled night after night Is it for his pleasure that I ve waited at home of an evening like a set of skittles to be set up and knocked over set up and knocked over by whatever balls or books he chose to bring against me Why I m a hundred times the man he is sir five hundred times Perhaps it was with the malicious intent of urging him on to his worst that mister Venus looked as if he doubted that What Was it outside the house at present ockypied to its disgrace by that minion of fortune and worm of the hour said Wegg falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation and slapping the counter that I Silas Wegg five hundred times the man he ever was sat in all weathers waiting for a errand or a customer Was it outside that very house as I first set eyes upon him rolling in the lap of luxury when I was selling halfpenny ballads there for a living And am I to grovel in the dust for HIM to walk over No There was a grin upon the ghastly countenance of the French gentleman under the influence of the firelight as if he were computing how many thousand slanderers and traitors array themselves against the fortunate on premises exactly answering to those of mister Wegg One might have fancied that the big headed babies were toppling over with their hydrocephalic attempts to reckon up the children of men who transform their benefactors into their injurers by the same process The yard or two of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with the meaning All about this was quite familiar knowledge down in the depths of the slime ages ago But said Wegg possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing effect your speaking countenance remarks mister Venus that I m duller and savager than usual Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much Begone dull Care Tis gone sir I ve looked in upon you and empire resumes her sway For as the song says subject to your correction sir When the heart of a man is depressed with cares The mist is dispelled if Venus appears Like the notes of a fiddle you sweetly sir sweetly Raises our spirits and charms our ears Good night sir I shall have a word or two to say to you mister Wegg before long remarked Venus respecting my share in the project we ve been speaking of My time sir returned Wegg is yours In the meanwhile let it be fully understood that I shall not neglect bringing the grindstone to bear nor yet bringing Dusty Boffin s nose to it His nose once brought to it shall be held to it by these hands mister Venus till the sparks flies out in showers With this agreeable promise Wegg stumped out and shut the shop door after him Wait till I light a candle mister Boffin said Venus and you ll come out more comfortable So he lighting a candle and holding it up at arm s length mister Boffin disengaged himself from behind the alligator s smile with an expression of countenance so very downcast that it not only appeared as if the alligator had the whole of the joke to himself but further as if it had been conceived and executed at mister Boffin s expense That s a treacherous fellow said mister Boffin dusting his arms and legs as he came forth the alligator having been but musty company That s a dreadful fellow The alligator sir said Venus No Venus no The Serpent You ll have the goodness to notice mister Boffin remarked Venus that I said nothing to him about my going out of the affair altogether because I didn t wish to take you anyways by surprise But I can t be too soon out of it for my satisfaction mister Boffin and I now put it to you when it will suit your views for me to retire Thank ee Venus thank ee Venus but I don t know what to say returned mister Boffin I don t know what to do He ll drop down on me any way He seems fully determined to drop down don t he mister Venus opined that such was clearly his intention You might be a sort of protection for me if you remained in it said mister Boffin you might stand betwixt him and me and take the edge off him Don t you feel as if you could make a show of remaining in it Venus till I had time to turn myself round Venus naturally inquired how long mister Boffin thought it might take him to turn himself round I am sure I don t know was the answer given quite at a loss Everything is so at sixes and sevens If I had never come into the property I shouldn t have minded But being in it it would be very trying to be turned out now don t you acknowledge that it would Venus mister Venus preferred he said to leave mister Boffin to arrive at his own conclusions on that delicate question I am sure I don t know what to do said mister Boffin If I ask advice of any one else it s only letting in another person to be bought out and then I shall be ruined that way and might as well have given up the property and gone slap to the workhouse If I was to take advice of my young man Rokesmith I should have to buy HIM out Sooner or later of course he d drop down upon me like Wegg I was brought into the world to be dropped down upon it appears to me mister Venus listened to these lamentations in silence while mister Boffin jogged to and fro holding his pockets as if he had a pain in them After all you haven t said what you mean to do yourself Venus When you do go out of it how do you mean to go Venus replied that as Wegg had found the document and handed it to him it was his intention to hand it back to Wegg with the declaration that he himself would have nothing to say to it or do with it and that Wegg must act as he chose and take the consequences And then he drops down with his whole weight upon ME cried mister Boffin ruefully I d sooner be dropped upon by you than by him or even by you jintly than by him alone mister Venus could only repeat that it was his fixed intention to betake himself to the paths of science and to walk in the same all the days of his life not dropping down upon his fellow creatures until they were deceased and then only to articulate them to the best of his humble ability How long could you be persuaded to keep up the appearance of remaining in it asked mister Boffin retiring on his other idea Could you be got to do so till the Mounds are gone No That would protract the mental uneasiness of mister Venus too long he said Not if I was to show you reason now demanded mister Boffin not if I was to show you good and sufficient reason If by good and sufficient reason mister Boffin meant honest and unimpeachable reason that might weigh with mister Venus against his personal wishes and convenience But he must add that he saw no opening to the possibility of such reason being shown him Come and see me Venus said mister Boffin at my house Is the reason there sir asked mister Venus with an incredulous smile and blink It may be or may not be said mister Boffin just as you view it But in the meantime don t go out of the matter Look here Do this Give me your word that you won t take any steps with Wegg without my knowledge just as I have given you my word that I won t without yours Done mister Boffin said Venus after brief consideration Thank ee Venus thank ee Venus Done When shall I come to see you mister Boffin When you like The sooner the better I must be going now Good night Venus Good night sir And good night to the rest of the present company said mister Boffin glancing round the shop They make a queer show Venus and I should like to be better acquainted with them some day Good night Venus good night Thankee Venus thankee Venus With that he jogged out into the street and jogged upon his homeward way Now I wonder he meditated as he went along nursing his stick whether it can be that Venus is setting himself to get the better of Wegg Whether it can be that he means when I have bought Wegg out to have me all to himself and to pick me clean to the bones It was a cunning and suspicious idea quite in the way of his school of Misers and he looked very cunning and suspicious as he went jogging through the streets More than once or twice more than twice or thrice say half a dozen times he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head Possibly the wooden countenance of mister Silas Wegg was incorporeally before him at those moments for he hit with intense satisfaction He was within a few streets of his own house when a little private carriage coming in the contrary direction passed him turned round and passed him again It was a little carriage of eccentric movement for again he heard it stop behind him and turn round and again he saw it pass him Then it stopped and then went on out of sight But not far out of sight for when he came to the corner of his own street there it stood again There was a lady s face at the window as he came up with this carriage and he was passing it when the lady softly called to him by his name I beg your pardon Ma am said mister Boffin coming to a stop It is missus Lammle said the lady mister Boffin went up to the window and hoped missus Lammle was well Not very well dear mister Boffin I have fluttered myself by being perhaps foolishly uneasy and anxious I have been waiting for you some time Can I speak to you mister Boffin proposed that missus Lammle should drive on to his house a few hundred yards further I would rather not mister Boffin unless you particularly wish it I feel the difficulty and delicacy of the matter so much that I would rather avoid speaking to you at your own home You must think this very strange mister Boffin said no but meant yes It is because I am so grateful for the good opinion of all my friends and am so touched by it that I cannot bear to run the risk of forfeiting it in any case even in the cause of duty I have asked my husband my dear Alfred mister Boffin whether it is the cause of duty and he has most emphatically said Yes I wish I had asked him sooner It would have spared me much distress Can this be more dropping down upon me thought mister Boffin quite bewildered It was Alfred who sent me to you mister Boffin Alfred said Don t come back Sophronia until you have seen mister Boffin and told him all Whatever he may think of it he ought certainly to know it Would you mind coming into the carriage mister Boffin answered Not at all and took his seat at missus Lammle s side Drive slowly anywhere missus Lammle called to her coachman and don t let the carriage rattle It MUST be more dropping down I think said mister Boffin to himself What next Chapter fifteen THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN AT HIS WORST The breakfast table at mister Boffin s was usually a very pleasant one and was always presided over by Bella As though he began each new day in his healthy natural character and some waking hours were necessary to his relapse into the corrupting influences of his wealth the face and the demeanour of the Golden Dustman were generally unclouded at that meal It would have been easy to believe then that there was no change in him It was as the day went on that the clouds gathered and the brightness of the morning became obscured One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened and that the night closed around him gradually But one morning long afterwards to be remembered it was black midnight with the Golden Dustman when he first appeared His altered character had never been so grossly marked His bearing towards his Secretary was so charged with insolent distrust and arrogance that the latter rose and left the table before breakfast was half done The look he directed at the Secretary s retiring figure was so cunningly malignant that Bella would have sat astounded and indignant even though he had not gone the length of secretly threatening Rokesmith with his clenched fist as he closed the door This unlucky morning of all mornings in the year was the morning next after mister Boffin s interview with missus Lammle in her little carriage Bella looked to missus Boffin s face for comment on or explanation of this stormy humour in her husband but none was there An anxious and a distressed observation of her own face was all she could read in it When they were left alone together which was not until noon for mister Boffin sat long in his easy chair by turns jogging up and down the breakfast room clenching his fist and muttering Bella in consternation asked her what had happened what was wrong I am forbidden to speak to you about it Bella dear I mustn t tell you was all the answer she could get And still whenever in her wonder and dismay she raised her eyes to missus Boffin s face she saw in it the same anxious and distressed observation of her own Oppressed by her sense that trouble was impending and lost in speculations why missus Boffin should look at her as if she had any part in it Bella found the day long and dreary It was far on in the afternoon when she being in her own room a servant brought her a message from mister Boffin begging her to come to his missus Boffin was there seated on a sofa and mister Boffin was jogging up and down On seeing Bella he stopped beckoned her to him and drew her arm through his Don t be alarmed my dear he said gently I am not angry with you Why you actually tremble Don t be alarmed Bella my dear I ll see you righted See me righted thought Bella And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment see me righted sir Ay ay said mister Boffin See you righted Send mister Rokesmith here you sir Bella would have been lost in perplexity if there had been pause enough but the servant found mister Rokesmith near at hand and he almost immediately presented himself Shut the door sir said mister Boffin I have got something to say to you which I fancy you ll not be pleased to hear I am sorry to reply mister Boffin returned the Secretary as having closed the door he turned and faced him that I think that very likely What do you mean blustered mister Boffin I mean that it has become no novelty to me to hear from your lips what I would rather not hear Oh Perhaps we shall change that said mister Boffin with a threatening roll of his head I hope so returned the Secretary He was quiet and respectful but stood as Bella thought and was glad to think on his manhood too Now sir said mister Boffin look at this young lady on my arm Bella involuntarily raising her eyes when this sudden reference was made to herself met those of mister Rokesmith He was pale and seemed agitated Then her eyes passed on to missus Boffin s and she met the look again In a flash it enlightened her and she began to understand what she had done I say to you sir mister Boffin repeated look at this young lady on my arm I do so returned the Secretary As his glance rested again on Bella for a moment she thought there was reproach in it But it is possible that the reproach was within herself How dare you sir said mister Boffin tamper unknown to me with this young lady How dare you come out of your station and your place in my house to pester this young lady with your impudent addresses I must decline to answer questions said the Secretary that are so offensively asked You decline to answer retorted mister Boffin You decline to answer do you Then I ll tell you what it is Rokesmith I ll answer for you There are two sides to this matter and I ll take em separately The first side is sheer Insolence That s the first side The Secretary smiled with some bitterness as though he would have said So I see and hear It was sheer Insolence in you I tell you said mister Boffin even to think of this young lady This young lady was far above YOU This young lady was no match for YOU This young lady was lying in wait as she was qualified to do for money and you had no money Bella hung her head and seemed to shrink a little from mister Boffin s protecting arm What are you I should like to know pursued mister Boffin that you were to have the audacity to follow up this young lady This young lady was looking about the market for a good bid she wasn t in it to be snapped up by fellows that had no money to lay out nothing to buy with Oh mister Boffin missus Boffin pray say something for me murmured Bella disengaging her arm and covering her face with her hands Old lady said mister Boffin anticipating his wife you hold your tongue Bella my dear don t you let yourself be put out I ll right you But you don t you don t right me exclaimed Bella with great emphasis You wrong me wrong me Don t you be put out my dear complacently retorted mister Boffin I ll bring this young man to book Now you Rokesmith You can t decline to hear you know as well as to answer You hear me tell you that the first side of your conduct was Insolence Insolence and Presumption Answer me one thing if you can Didn t this young lady tell you so herself Did I mister Rokesmith asked Bella with her face still covered O say mister Rokesmith Did I Don t be distressed Miss Wilfer it matters very little now Ah You can t deny it though said mister Boffin with a knowing shake of his head But I have asked him to forgive me since cried Bella and I would ask him to forgive me now again upon my knees if it would spare him Here missus Boffin broke out a crying Old lady said mister Boffin stop that noise Tender hearted in you Miss Bella but I mean to have it out right through with this young man having got him into a corner Now you Rokesmith I tell you that s one side of your conduct Insolence and Presumption Now I m a coming to the other which is much worse This was a speculation of yours I indignantly deny it It s of no use your denying it it doesn t signify a bit whether you deny it or not I ve got a head upon my shoulders and it ain t a baby s What said mister Boffin gathering himself together in his most suspicious attitude and wrinkling his face into a very map of curves and corners Don t I know what grabs are made at a man with money If I didn t keep my eyes open and my pockets buttoned shouldn t I be brought to the workhouse before I knew where I was Wasn t the experience of Dancer and Elwes and Hopkins and Blewbury Jones and ever so many more of em similar to mine Didn t everybody want to make grabs at what they d got and bring em to poverty and ruin Weren t they forced to hide everything belonging to em for fear it should be snatched from em Of course they was I shall be told next that they didn t know human natur They Poor creatures murmured the Secretary What do you say asked mister Boffin snapping at him However you needn t be at the trouble of repeating it for it ain t worth hearing and won t go down with ME I m a going to unfold your plan before this young lady I m a going to show this young lady the second view of you and nothing you can say will stave it off Now attend here Bella my dear Rokesmith you re a needy chap You re a chap that I pick up in the street Are you or ain t you Go on mister Boffin don t appeal to me Not appeal to YOU retorted mister Boffin as if he hadn t done so No I should hope not Appealing to YOU would be rather a rum course As I was saying you re a needy chap that I pick up in the street You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary and I take you Very good Very bad murmured the Secretary What do you say asked mister Boffin snapping at him again He returned no answer mister Boffin after eyeing him with a comical look of discomfited curiosity was fain to begin afresh This Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for my Secretary out of the open street This Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs and gets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady Oho says this Rokesmith here mister Boffin clapped a finger against his nose and tapped it several times with a sneaking air as embodying Rokesmith confidentially confabulating with his own nose This will be a good haul I ll go in for this And so this Rokesmith greedy and hungering begins a creeping on his hands and knees towards the money Not so bad a speculation either for if this young lady had had less spirit or had had less sense through being at all in the romantic line by George he might have worked it out and made it pay But fortunately she was too many for him and a pretty figure he cuts now he is exposed There he stands said mister Boffin addressing Rokesmith himself with ridiculous inconsistency Look at him Your unfortunate suspicions mister Boffin began the Secretary Precious unfortunate for you I can tell you said mister Boffin are not to be combated by any one and I address myself to no such hopeless task But I will say a word upon the truth Yah Much you care about the truth said mister Boffin with a snap of his fingers Noddy My dear love expostulated his wife Old lady returned mister Boffin you keep still I say to this Rokesmith here much he cares about the truth I tell him again much he cares about the truth Our connexion being at an end mister Boffin said the Secretary it can be of very little moment to me what you say Oh You are knowing enough retorted mister Boffin with a sly look to have found out that our connexion s at an end eh But you can t get beforehand with me Look at this in my hand This is your pay on your discharge You can only follow suit You can t deprive me of the lead Let s have no pretending that you discharge yourself I discharge you So that I go remarked the Secretary waving the point aside with his hand it is all one to me Is it said mister Boffin But it s two to me let me tell you Allowing a fellow that s found out to discharge himself is one thing discharging him for insolence and presumption and likewise for designs upon his master s money is another One and one s two not one Old lady don t you cut in You keep still Have you said all you wish to say to me demanded the Secretary I don t know whether I have or not answered mister Boffin It depends Perhaps you will consider whether there are any other strong expressions that you would like to bestow upon me I ll consider that said mister Boffin obstinately at my convenience and not at yours You want the last word It may not be suitable to let you have it Noddy My dear dear Noddy You sound so hard cried poor missus Boffin not to be quite repressed Old lady said her husband but without harshness if you cut in when requested not I ll get a pillow and carry you out of the room upon it What do you want to say you Rokesmith To you mister Boffin nothing But to Miss Wilfer and to your good kind wife a word Out with it then replied mister Boffin and cut it short for we ve had enough of you I have borne said the Secretary in a low voice with my false position here that I might not be separated from Miss Wilfer To be near her has been a recompense to me from day to day even for the undeserved treatment I have had here and for the degraded aspect in which she has often seen me Since Miss Wilfer rejected me I have never again urged my suit to the best of my belief with a spoken syllable or a look But I have never changed in my devotion to her except if she will forgive my saying so that it is deeper than it was and better founded Now mark this chap s saying Miss Wilfer when he means L s d cried mister Boffin with a cunning wink Now mark this chap s making Miss Wilfer stand for Pounds Shillings and Pence My feeling for Miss Wilfer pursued the Secretary without deigning to notice him is not one to be ashamed of I avow it I love her Let me go where I may when I presently leave this house I shall go into a blank life leaving her Leaving L s d behind me said mister Boffin by way of commentary with another wink That I am incapable the Secretary went on still without heeding him of a mercenary project or a mercenary thought in connexion with Miss Wilfer is nothing meritorious in me because any prize that I could put before my fancy would sink into insignificance beside her If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me and making me more hopeless if that could be Say remarked the Secretary looking full at his late master say that with a word she could strip mister Boffin of his fortune and take possession of it she would be of no greater worth in my eyes than she is What do you think by this time old lady asked mister Boffin turning to his wife in a bantering tone about this Rokesmith here and his caring for the truth You needn t say what you think my dear because I don t want you to cut in but you can think it all the same As to taking possession of my property I warrant you he wouldn t do that himself if he could No returned the Secretary with another full look Ha ha ha laughed mister Boffin There s nothing like a good un while you ARE about it I have been for a moment said the Secretary turning from him and falling into his former manner diverted from the little I have to say My interest in Miss Wilfer began when I first saw her even began when I had only heard of her It was in fact the cause of my throwing myself in mister Boffin s way and entering his service Miss Wilfer has never known this until now I mention it now only as a corroboration though I hope it may be needless of my being free from the sordid design attributed to me Now this is a very artful dog said mister Boffin with a deep look This is a longer headed schemer than I thought him See how patiently and methodically he goes to work He gets to know about me and my property and about this young lady and her share in poor young John s story and he puts this and that together and he says to himself I ll get in with Boffin and I ll get in with this young lady and I ll work em both at the same time and I ll bring my pigs to market somewhere I hear him say it bless you I look at him now and I see him say it mister Boffin pointed at the culprit as it were in the act and hugged himself in his great penetration But luckily he hadn t to deal with the people he supposed Bella my dear said mister Boffin No Luckily he had to deal with you and with me and with Daniel and Miss Dancer and with Elwes and with Vulture Hopkins and with Blewbury Jones and all the rest of us one down t other come on And he s beat that s what he is regularly beat He thought to squeeze money out of us and he has done for himself instead Bella my dear Bella my dear made no response gave no sign of acquiescence When she had first covered her face she had sunk upon a chair with her hands resting on the back of it and had never moved since There was a short silence at this point and missus Boffin softly rose as if to go to her But mister Boffin stopped her with a gesture and she obediently sat down again and stayed where she was There s your pay Mister Rokesmith said the Golden Dustman jerking the folded scrap of paper he had in his hand towards his late Secretary I dare say you can stoop to pick it up after what you have stooped to here I have stooped to nothing but this Rokesmith answered as he took it from the ground and this is mine for I have earned it by the hardest of hard labour You re a pretty quick packer I hope said mister Boffin because the sooner you are gone bag and baggage the better for all parties You need have no fear of my lingering There s just one thing though said mister Boffin that I should like to ask you before we come to a good riddance if it was only to show this young lady how conceited you schemers are in thinking that nobody finds out how you contradict yourselves Ask me anything you wish to ask returned Rokesmith but use the expedition that you recommend You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady said mister Boffin laying his hand protectingly on Bella s head without looking down at her I do not pretend Oh Well You HAVE a mighty admiration for this young lady since you are so particular Yes How do you reconcile that with this young lady s being a weak spirited improvident idiot not knowing what was due to herself flinging up her money to the church weathercocks and racing off at a splitting pace for the workhouse I don t understand you Don t you Or won t you What else could you have made this young lady out to be if she had listened to such addresses as yours What else if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess her heart Win her affections retorted mister Boffin with ineffable contempt and possess her heart Mew says the cat Quack quack says the duck Bow wow wow says the dog Win her affections and possess her heart Mew Quack quack Bow wow John Rokesmith stared at him in his outburst as if with some faint idea that he had gone mad What is due to this young lady said mister Boffin is Money and this young lady right well knows it You slander the young lady YOU slander the young lady you with your affections and hearts and trumpery returned mister Boffin It s of a piece with the rest of your behaviour I heard of these doings of yours only last night or you should have heard of em from me sooner take your oath of it I heard of em from a lady with as good a headpiece as the best and she knows this young lady and I know this young lady and we all three know that it s Money she makes a stand for money money money and that you and your affections and hearts are a Lie sir missus Boffin said Rokesmith quietly turning to her for your delicate and unvarying kindness I thank you with the warmest gratitude Good bye Miss Wilfer good bye And now my dear said mister Boffin laying his hand on Bella s head again you may begin to make yourself quite comfortable and I hope you feel that you ve been righted But Bella was so far from appearing to feel it that she shrank from his hand and from the chair and starting up in an incoherent passion of tears and stretching out her arms cried O mister Rokesmith before you go if you could but make me poor again O Make me poor again Somebody I beg and pray or my heart will break if this goes on Pa dear make me poor again and take me home I was bad enough there but I have been so much worse here Don t give me money mister Boffin I won t have money Keep it away from me and only let me speak to good little Pa and lay my head upon his shoulder and tell him all my griefs Nobody else can understand me nobody else can comfort me nobody else knows how unworthy I am and yet can love me like a little child I am better with Pa than any one more innocent more sorry more glad So crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this Bella drooped her head on missus Boffin s ready breast John Rokesmith from his place in the room and mister Boffin from his looked on at her in silence until she was silent herself Then mister Boffin observed in a soothing and comfortable tone There my dear there you are righted now and it s ALL right I don t wonder I m sure at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow but it s all over my dear and you re righted and it s and it s ALL right Which mister Boffin repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and finality I hate you cried Bella turning suddenly upon him with a stamp of her little foot at least I can t hate you but I don t like you HUL LO exclaimed mister Boffin in an amazed under tone You re a scolding unjust abusive aggravating bad old creature cried Bella I am angry with my ungrateful self for calling you names but you are you are you know you are mister Boffin stared here and stared there as misdoubting that he must be in some sort of fit I have heard you with shame said Bella With shame for myself and with shame for you You ought to be above the base tale bearing of a time serving woman but you are above nothing now mister Boffin seeming to become convinced that this was a fit rolled his eyes and loosened his neckcloth When I came here I respected you and honoured you and I soon loved you cried Bella And now I can t bear the sight of you At least I don t know that I ought to go so far as that only you re a you re a Monster Having shot this bolt out with a great expenditure of force Bella hysterically laughed and cried together The best wish I can wish you is said Bella returning to the charge that you had not one single farthing in the world If any true friend and well wisher could make you a bankrupt you would be a Duck but as a man of property you are a Demon After despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of force Bella laughed and cried still more mister Rokesmith pray stay one moment Pray hear one word from me before you go I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my account Out of the depths of my heart I earnestly and truly beg your pardon As she stepped towards him he met her As she gave him her hand he put it to his lips and said God bless you No laughing was mixed with Bella s crying then her tears were pure and fervent There is not an ungenerous word that I have heard addressed to you heard with scorn and indignation mister Rokesmith but it has wounded me far more than you for I have deserved it and you never have mister Rokesmith it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night I parted with the secret even while I was angry with myself for doing so It was very bad in me but indeed it was not wicked I did it in a moment of conceit and folly one of my many such moments one of my many such hours years As I am punished for it severely try to forgive it I do with all my soul Thank you O thank you Don t part from me till I have said one other word to do you justice The only fault you can be truly charged with in having spoken to me as you did that night with how much delicacy and how much forbearance no one but I can know or be grateful to you for is that you laid yourself open to be slighted by a worldly shallow girl whose head was turned and who was quite unable to rise to the worth of what you offered her mister Rokesmith that girl has often seen herself in a pitiful and poor light since but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now when the mean tone in which she answered you sordid and vain girl that she was has been echoed in her ears by mister Boffin He kissed her hand again mister Boffin s speeches were detestable to me shocking to me said Bella startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot It is quite true that there was a time and very lately when I deserved to be so righted mister Rokesmith but I hope that I shall never deserve it again He once more put her hand to his lips and then relinquished it and left the room Bella was hurrying back to the chair in which she had hidden her face so long when catching sight of missus Boffin by the way she stopped at her He is gone sobbed Bella indignantly despairingly in fifty ways at once with her arms round missus Boffin s neck He has been most shamefully abused and most unjustly and most basely driven away and I am the cause of it All this time mister Boffin had been rolling his eyes over his loosened neckerchief as if his fit were still upon him Appearing now to think that he was coming to he stared straight before him for a while tied his neckerchief again took several long inspirations swallowed several times and ultimately exclaimed with a deep sigh as if he felt himself on the whole better Well No word good or bad did missus Boffin say but she tenderly took care of Bella and glanced at her husband as if for orders mister Boffin without imparting any took his seat on a chair over against them and there sat leaning forward with a fixed countenance his legs apart a hand on each knee and his elbows squared until Bella should dry her eyes and raise her head which in the fulness of time she did I must go home said Bella rising hurriedly I am very grateful to you for all you have done for me but I can t stay here My darling girl remonstrated missus Boffin No I can t stay here said Bella I can t indeed Ugh you vicious old thing This to mister Boffin Don t be rash my love urged missus Boffin Think well of what you do Yes you had better think well said mister Boffin I shall never more think well of YOU cried Bella cutting him short with intense defiance in her expressive little eyebrows and championship of the late Secretary in every dimple No Never again Your money has changed you to marble You are a hard hearted Miser You are worse than Dancer worse than Hopkins worse than Blackberry Jones worse than any of the wretches And more proceeded Bella breaking into tears again you were wholly undeserving of the Gentleman you have lost Why you don t mean to say Miss Bella the Golden Dustman slowly remonstrated that you set up Rokesmith against me I do said Bella He is worth a Million of you Very pretty she looked though very angry as she made herself as tall as she possibly could which was not extremely tall and utterly renounced her patron with a lofty toss of her rich brown head I would rather he thought well of me said Bella though he swept the street for bread than that you did though you splashed the mud upon him from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold There Well I m sure cried mister Boffin staring And for a long time past when you have thought you set yourself above him I have only seen you under his feet said Bella There And throughout I saw in him the master and I saw in you the man There And when you used him shamefully I took his part and loved him There I boast of it After which strong avowal Bella underwent reaction and cried to any extent with her face on the back of her chair Now look here said mister Boffin as soon as he could find an opening for breaking the silence and striking in Give me your attention Bella I am not angry I AM said Bella I say resumed the Golden Dustman I am not angry and I mean kindly to you and I want to overlook this So you ll stay where you are and we ll agree to say no more about it No I can t stay here cried Bella rising hurriedly again I can t think of staying here I must go home for good Now don t be silly mister Boffin reasoned Don t do what you can t undo don t do what you re sure to be sorry for I shall never be sorry for it said Bella and I should always be sorry and should every minute of my life despise myself if I remained here after what has happened At least Bella argued mister Boffin let there be no mistake about it Look before you leap you know Stay where you are and all s well and all s as it was to be Go away and you can never come back I know that I can never come back and that s what I mean said Bella You mustn t expect mister Boffin pursued that I m a going to settle money on you if you leave us like this because I am not No Bella Be careful Not one brass farthing Expect said Bella haughtily Do you think that any power on earth could make me take it if you did sir But there was missus Boffin to part from and in the full flush of her dignity the impressible little soul collapsed again Down upon her knees before that good woman she rocked herself upon her breast and cried and sobbed and folded her in her arms with all her might You re a dear a dear the best of dears cried Bella You re the best of human creatures I can never be thankful enough to you and I can never forget you If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I shall see and hear you in my fancy to the last of my dim old days missus Boffin wept most heartily and embraced her with all fondness but said not one single word except that she was her dear girl She said that often enough to be sure for she said it over and over again but not one word else Bella broke from her at length and was going weeping out of the room when in her own little queer affectionate way she half relented towards mister Boffin I am very glad sobbed Bella that I called you names sir because you richly deserved it But I am very sorry that I called you names because you used to be so different Say good bye Good bye said mister Boffin shortly If I knew which of your hands was the least spoilt I would ask you to let me touch it said Bella for the last time But not because I repent of what I have said to you For I don t It s true Try the left hand said mister Boffin holding it out in a stolid manner it s the least used You have been wonderfully good and kind to me said Bella and I kiss it for that You have been as bad as bad could be to mister Rokesmith and I throw it away for that Thank you for myself and good bye Good bye said mister Boffin as before Bella caught him round the neck and kissed him and ran out for ever She ran up stairs and sat down on the floor in her own room and cried abundantly But the day was declining and she had no time to lose She opened all the places where she kept her dresses selected only those she had brought with her leaving all the rest and made a great misshapen bundle of them to be sent for afterwards I won t take one of the others said Bella tying the knots of the bundle very tight in the severity of her resolution I ll leave all the presents behind and begin again entirely on my own account That the resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice she even changed the dress she wore for that in which she had come to the grand mansion Even the bonnet she put on was the bonnet that had mounted into the Boffin chariot at Holloway Now I am complete said Bella It s a little trying but I have steeped my eyes in cold water and I won t cry any more You have been a pleasant room to me dear room Adieu We shall never see each other again With a parting kiss of her fingers to it she softly closed the door and went with a light foot down the great staircase pausing and listening as she went that she might meet none of the household No one chanced to be about and she got down to the hall in quiet The door of the late Secretary s room stood open She peeped in as she passed and divined from the emptiness of his table and the general appearance of things that he was already gone Softly opening the great hall door and softly closing it upon herself she turned and kissed it on the outside insensible old combination of wood and iron that it was before she ran away from the house at a swift pace That was well done panted Bella slackening in the next street and subsiding into a walk If I had left myself any breath to cry with I should have cried again Now poor dear darling little Pa you are going to see your lovely woman unexpectedly Chapter sixteen THE FEAST OF THE THREE HOBGOBLINS The City looked unpromising enough as Bella made her way along its gritty streets Most of its money mills were slackening sail or had left off grinding for the day The master millers had already departed and the journeymen were departing There was a jaded aspect on the business lanes and courts and the very pavements had a weary appearance confused by the tread of a million of feet There must be hours of night to temper down the day s distraction of so feverish a place As yet the worry of the newly stopped whirling and grinding on the part of the money mills seemed to linger in the air and the quiet was more like the prostration of a spent giant than the repose of one who was renewing his strength If Bella thought as she glanced at the mighty Bank how agreeable it would be to have an hour s gardening there with a bright copper shovel among the money still she was not in an avaricious vein Much improved in that respect and with certain half formed images which had little gold in their composition dancing before her bright eyes she arrived in the drug flavoured region of Mincing Lane with the sensation of having just opened a drawer in a chemist s shop The counting house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles was pointed out by an elderly female accustomed to the care of offices who dropped upon Bella out of a public house wiping her mouth and accounted for its humidity on natural principles well known to the physical sciences by explaining that she had looked in at the door to see what o clock it was The counting house was a wall eyed ground floor by a dark gateway and Bella was considering as she approached it could there be any precedent in the City for her going in and asking for R Wilfer when whom should she see sitting at one of the windows with the plate glass sash raised but R Wilfer himself preparing to take a slight refection On approaching nearer Bella discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage loaf and a pennyworth of milk Simultaneously with this discovery on her part her father discovered her and invoked the echoes of Mincing Lane to exclaim My gracious me He then came cherubically flying out without a hat and embraced her and handed her in For it s after hours and I am all alone my dear he explained and am having as I sometimes do when they are all gone a quiet tea Looking round the office as if her father were a captive and this his cell Bella hugged him and choked him to her heart s content I never was so surprised my dear said her father I couldn t believe my eyes Upon my life I thought they had taken to lying The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself Why didn t you send the footman down the Lane my dear I have brought no footman with me Pa Oh indeed But you have brought the elegant turn out my love No Pa You never can have walked my dear Yes I have Pa He looked so very much astonished that Bella could not make up her mind to break it to him just yet The consequence is Pa that your lovely woman feels a little faint and would very much like to share your tea The cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk had been set forth on a sheet of paper on the window seat The cherubic pocket knife with the first bit of the loaf still on its point lay beside them where it had been hastily thrown down Bella took the bit off and put it in her mouth My dear child said her father the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare But at least you must have your own loaf and your own penn orth One moment my dear The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner Regardless of Bella s dissuasions he ran out and quickly returned with the new supply My dear child he said as he spread it on another piece of paper before her the idea of a splendid and then looked at her figure and stopped short What s the matter Pa of a splendid female he resumed more slowly putting up with such accommodation as the present Is that a new dress you have on my dear No Pa an old one Don t you remember it Why I THOUGHT I remembered it my dear You should for you bought it Pa Yes I THOUGHT I bought it my dear said the cherub giving himself a little shake as if to rouse his faculties And have you grown so fickle that you don t like your own taste Pa dear Well my love he returned swallowing a bit of the cottage loaf with considerable effort for it seemed to stick by the way I should have thought it was hardly sufficiently splendid for existing circumstances And so Pa said Bella moving coaxingly to his side instead of remaining opposite you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone I am not in the tea s way if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this Pa Yes my dear and no my dear Yes to the first question and Certainly Not to the second Respecting the quiet tea my dear why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing and if there s nothing interposed between the day and your mother why SHE is sometimes a little wearing too I know Pa Yes my dear So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here with a little quiet contemplation of the Lane which comes soothing between the day and domestic Bliss suggested Bella sorrowfully And domestic Bliss said her father quite contented to accept the phrase Bella kissed him And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity poor dear that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home Not at home or not on the road there or on the road here my love Yes You see that little desk in the corner In the dark corner furthest both from the light and from the fireplace The shabbiest desk of all the desks Now does it really strike you in that point of view my dear said her father surveying it artistically with his head on one side that s mine That s called Rumty s Perch Whose Perch asked Bella with great indignation Rumty s You see being rather high and up two steps they call it a Perch And they call ME Rumty How dare they exclaimed Bella They re playful Bella my dear they re playful They re more or less younger than I am and they re playful What does it matter It might be Surly or Sulky or fifty disagreeable things that I really shouldn t like to be considered But Rumty Lor why not Rumty To inflict a heavy disappointment on this sweet nature which had been through all her caprices the object of her recognition love and admiration from infancy Bella felt to be the hardest task of her hard day I should have done better she thought to tell him at first I should have done better to tell him just now when he had some slight misgiving he is quite happy again and I shall make him wretched He was falling back on his loaf and milk with the pleasantest composure and Bella stealing her arm a little closer about him and at the same time sticking up his hair with an irresistible propensity to play with him founded on the habit of her whole life had prepared herself to say Pa dear don t be cast down but I must tell you something disagreeable when he interrupted her in an unlooked for manner My gracious me he exclaimed invoking the Mincing Lane echoes as before This is very extraordinary What is Pa Why here s mister Rokesmith now No no Pa no cried Bella greatly flurried Surely not Yes there is Look here Sooth to say mister Rokesmith not only passed the window but came into the counting house And not only came into the counting house but finding himself alone there with Bella and her father rushed at Bella and caught her in his arms with the rapturous words My dear dear girl my gallant generous disinterested courageous noble girl And not only that even which one might have thought astonishment enough for one dose but Bella after hanging her head for a moment lifted it up and laid it on his breast as if that were her head s chosen and lasting resting place I knew you would come to him and I followed you said Rokesmith My love my life You ARE mine To which Bella responded Yes I AM yours if you think me worth taking And after that seemed to shrink to next to nothing in the clasp of his arms partly because it was such a strong one on his part and partly because there was such a yielding to it on hers The cherub whose hair would have done for itself under the influence of this amazing spectacle what Bella had just now done for it staggered back into the window seat from which he had risen and surveyed the pair with his eyes dilated to their utmost But we must think of dear Pa said Bella I haven t told dear Pa let us speak to Pa Upon which they turned to do so I wish first my dear remarked the cherub faintly that you d have the kindness to sprinkle me with a little milk for I feel as if I was Going In fact the good little fellow had become alarmingly limp and his senses seemed to be rapidly escaping from the knees upward Bella sprinkled him with kisses instead of milk but gave him a little of that article to drink and he gradually revived under her caressing care We ll break it to you gently dearest Pa said Bella My dear returned the cherub looking at them both you broke so much in the first Gush if I may so express myself that I think I am equal to a good large breakage now mister Wilfer said John Rokesmith excitedly and joyfully Bella takes me though I have no fortune even no present occupation nothing but what I can get in the life before us Bella takes me Yes I should rather have inferred my dear sir returned the cherub feebly that Bella took you from what I have within these few minutes remarked You don t know Pa said Bella how ill I have used him You don t know sir said Rokesmith what a heart she has You don t know Pa said Bella what a shocking creature I was growing when he saved me from myself You don t know sir said Rokesmith what a sacrifice she has made for me My dear Bella replied the cherub still pathetically scared and my dear John Rokesmith if you will allow me so to call you Yes do Pa do urged Bella I allow you and my will is his law Isn t it dear John Rokesmith There was an engaging shyness in Bella coupled with an engaging tenderness of love and confidence and pride in thus first calling him by name which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to do what he did What he did was once more to give her the appearance of vanishing as aforesaid I think my dears observed the cherub that if you could make it convenient to sit one on one side of me and the other on the other we should get on rather more consecutively and make things rather plainer John Rokesmith mentioned a while ago that he had no present occupation None said Rokesmith No Pa none said Bella From which I argue proceeded the cherub that he has left mister Boffin Yes Pa And so Stop a bit my dear I wish to lead up to it by degrees And that mister Boffin has not treated him well Has treated him most shamefully dear Pa cried Bella with a flashing face Of which pursued the cherub enjoining patience with his hand a certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself could not approve Am I leading up to it right Could not approve sweet Pa said Bella with a tearful laugh and a joyful kiss Upon which pursued the cherub the certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself having previously observed and mentioned to myself that prosperity was spoiling mister Boffin felt that she must not sell her sense of what was right and what was wrong and what was true and what was false and what was just and what was unjust for any price that could be paid to her by any one alive Am I leading up to it right With another tearful laugh Bella joyfully kissed him again And therefore and therefore the cherub went on in a glowing voice as Bella s hand stole gradually up his waistcoat to his neck this mercenary young person distantly related to myself refused the price took off the splendid fashions that were part of it put on the comparatively poor dress that I had last given her and trusting to my supporting her in what was right came straight to me Have I led up to it Bella s hand was round his neck by this time and her face was on it The mercenary young person distantly related to myself said her good father did well The mercenary young person distantly related to myself did not trust to me in vain I admire this mercenary young person distantly related to myself more in this dress than if she had come to me in China silks Cashmere shawls and Golconda diamonds I love this young person dearly I say to the man of this young person s heart out of my heart and with all of it My blessing on this engagement betwixt you and she brings you a good fortune when she brings you the poverty she has accepted for your sake and the honest truth s The stanch little man s voice failed him as he gave John Rokesmith his hand and he was silent bending his face low over his daughter But not for long He soon looked up saying in a sprightly tone And now my dear child if you think you can entertain John Rokesmith for a minute and a half I ll run over to the Dairy and fetch HIM a cottage loaf and a drink of milk that we may all have tea together It was as Bella gaily said like the supper provided for the three nursery hobgoblins at their house in the forest without their thunderous low growlings of the alarming discovery Somebody s been drinking MY milk It was a delicious repast by far the most delicious that Bella or John Rokesmith or even R Wilfer had ever made The uncongenial oddity of its surroundings with the two brass knobs of the iron safe of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles staring from a corner like the eyes of some dull dragon only made it the more delightful To think said the cherub looking round the office with unspeakable enjoyment that anything of a tender nature should come off here is what tickles me To think that ever I should have seen my Bella folded in the arms of her future husband HERE you know It was not until the cottage loaves and the milk had for some time disappeared and the foreshadowings of night were creeping over Mincing Lane that the cherub by degrees became a little nervous and said to Bella as he cleared his throat Hem Have you thought at all about your mother my dear Yes Pa And your sister Lavvy for instance my dear Yes Pa I think we had better not enter into particulars at home I think it will be quite enough to say that I had a difference with mister Boffin and have left for good John Rokesmith being acquainted with your Ma my love said her father after some slight hesitation I need have no delicacy in hinting before him that you may perhaps find your Ma a little wearing A little patient Pa said Bella with a tuneful laugh the tune fuller for being so loving in its tone Well We ll say strictly in confidence among ourselves wearing we won t qualify it the cherub stoutly admitted And your sister s temper is wearing I don t mind Pa And you must prepare yourself you know my precious said her father with much gentleness for our looking very poor and meagre at home and being at the best but very uncomfortable after mister Boffin s house I don t mind Pa I could bear much harder trials for John The closing words were not so softly and blushingly said but that John heard them and showed that he heard them by again assisting Bella to another of those mysterious disappearances Well said the cherub gaily and not expressing disapproval when you when you come back from retirement my love and reappear on the surface I think it will be time to lock up and go If the counting house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles had ever been shut up by three happier people glad as most people were to shut it up they must have been superlatively happy indeed But first Bella mounted upon Rumty s Perch and said Show me what you do here all day long dear Pa Do you write like this laying her round cheek upon her plump left arm and losing sight of her pen in waves of hair in a highly unbusiness like manner Though John Rokesmith seemed to like it So the three hobgoblins having effaced all traces of their feast and swept up the crumbs came out of Mincing Lane to walk to Holloway and if two of the hobgoblins didn t wish the distance twice as long as it was the third hobgoblin was much mistaken Indeed that modest spirit deemed himself so much in the way of their deep enjoyment of the journey that he apologetically remarked I think my dears I ll take the lead on the other side of the road and seem not to belong to you Which he did cherubically strewing the path with smiles in the absence of flowers It was almost ten o clock when they stopped within view of Wilfer Castle and then the spot being quiet and deserted Bella began a series of disappearances which threatened to last all night I think John the cherub hinted at last that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to myself I ll take her in I can t spare her answered John but I must lend her to you My Darling A word of magic which caused Bella instantly to disappear again Now dearest Pa said Bella when she became visible put your hand in mine and we ll run home as fast as ever we can run and get it over Now Pa Once My dear the cherub faltered with something of a craven air I was going to observe that if your mother You mustn t hang back sir to gain time cried Bella putting out her right foot do you see that sir That s the mark come up to the mark sir Once Twice Three times and away Pa Off she skimmed bearing the cherub along nor ever stopped nor suffered him to stop until she had pulled at the bell Now dear Pa said Bella taking him by both ears as if he were a pitcher and conveying his face to her rosy lips we are in for it Miss Lavvy came out to open the gate waited on by that attentive cavalier and friend of the family mister George Sampson Why it s never Bella exclaimed Miss Lavvy starting back at the sight And then bawled Ma Here s Bella This produced before they could get into the house missus Wilfer Who standing in the portal received them with ghostly gloom and all her other appliances of ceremony My child is welcome though unlooked for said she at the time presenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol themselves upon You too R W are welcome though late Does the male domestic of missus Boffin hear me there This deep toned inquiry was cast forth into the night for response from the menial in question There is no one waiting Ma dear said Bella There is no one waiting repeated missus Wilfer in majestic accents No Ma dear A dignified shiver pervaded missus Wilfer s shoulders and gloves as who should say An Enigma and then she marched at the head of the procession to the family keeping room where she observed Unless R W who started on being solemnly turned upon you have taken the precaution of making some addition to our frugal supper on your way home it will prove but a distasteful one to Bella Cold neck of mutton and a lettuce can ill compete with the luxuries of mister Boffin s board Pray don t talk like that Ma dear said Bella mister Boffin s board is nothing to me But here Miss Lavinia who had been intently eyeing Bella s bonnet struck in with Why Bella Yes Lavvy I know The Irrepressible lowered her eyes to Bella s dress and stooped to look at it exclaiming again Why Bella Yes Lavvy I know what I have got on I was going to tell Ma when you interrupted I have left mister Boffin s house for good Ma and I have come home again missus Wilfer spake no word but having glared at her offspring for a minute or two in an awful silence retired into her corner of state backward and sat down like a frozen article on sale in a Russian market In short dear Ma said Bella taking off the depreciated bonnet and shaking out her hair I have had a very serious difference with mister Boffin on the subject of his treatment of a member of his household and it s a final difference and there s an end of all And I am bound to tell you my dear added R W submissively that Bella has acted in a truly brave spirit and with a truly right feeling And therefore I hope my dear you ll not allow yourself to be greatly disappointed George said Miss Lavvy in a sepulchral warning voice founded on her mother s George Sampson speak What did I tell you about those Boffins mister Sampson perceiving his frail bark to be labouring among shoals and breakers thought it safest not to refer back to any particular thing that he had been told lest he should refer back to the wrong thing With admirable seamanship he got his bark into deep water by murmuring Yes indeed Yes I told George Sampson as George Sampson tells you said Miss Lavvy that those hateful Boffins would pick a quarrel with Bella as soon as her novelty had worn off Have they done it or have they not Was I right or was I wrong And what do you say to us Bella of your Boffins now Lavvy and Ma said Bella I say of mister and missus Boffin what I always have said and I always shall say of them what I always have said But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to night I hope you are not sorry to see me Ma dear kissing her and I hope you are not sorry to see me Lavvy kissing her too and as I notice the lettuce Ma mentioned on the table I ll make the salad Bella playfully setting herself about the task missus Wilfer s impressive countenance followed her with glaring eyes presenting a combination of the once popular sign of the Saracen s Head with a piece of Dutch clock work and suggesting to an imaginative mind that from the composition of the salad her daughter might prudently omit the vinegar But no word issued from the majestic matron s lips And this was more terrific to her husband as perhaps she knew than any flow of eloquence with which she could have edified the company Now Ma dear said Bella in due course the salad s ready and it s past supper time missus Wilfer rose but remained speechless George said Miss Lavinia in her voice of warning Ma s chair mister Sampson flew to the excellent lady s back and followed her up close chair in hand as she stalked to the banquet Arrived at the table she took her rigid seat after favouring mister Sampson with a glare for himself which caused the young gentleman to retire to his place in much confusion The cherub not presuming to address so tremendous an object transacted her supper through the agency of a third person as Mutton to your Ma Bella my dear and Lavvy I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put it on her plate missus Wilfer s manner of receiving those viands was marked by petrified absence of mind in which state likewise she partook of them occasionally laying down her knife and fork as saying within her own spirit What is this I am doing and glaring at one or other of the party as if in indignant search of information A magnetic result of such glaring was that the person glared at could not by any means successfully pretend to be ignorant of the fact so that a bystander without beholding missus Wilfer at all must have known at whom she was glaring by seeing her refracted from the countenance of the beglared one Miss Lavinia was extremely affable to mister Sampson on this special occasion and took the opportunity of informing her sister why It was not worth troubling you about Bella when you were in a sphere so far removed from your family as to make it a matter in which you could be expected to take very little interest said Lavinia with a toss of her chin but George Sampson is paying his addresses to me Bella was glad to hear it mister Sampson became thoughtfully red and felt called upon to encircle Miss Lavinia s waist with his arm but encountering a large pin in the young lady s belt scarified a finger uttered a sharp exclamation and attracted the lightning of missus Wilfer s glare George is getting on very well said Miss Lavinia which might not have been supposed at the moment and I dare say we shall be married one of these days I didn t care to mention it when you were with your Bof here Miss Lavinia checked herself in a bounce and added more placidly when you were with mister and missus Boffin but now I think it sisterly to name the circumstance Thank you Lavvy dear I congratulate you Thank you Bella The truth is George and I did discuss whether I should tell you but I said to George that you wouldn t be much interested in so paltry an affair and that it was far more likely you would rather detach yourself from us altogether than have him added to the rest of us That was a mistake dear Lavvy said Bella It turns out to be replied Miss Lavinia but circumstances have changed you know my dear George is in a new situation and his prospects are very good indeed I shouldn t have had the courage to tell you so yesterday when you would have thought his prospects poor and not worth notice but I feel quite bold tonight When did you begin to feel timid Lavvy inquired Bella with a smile I didn t say that I ever felt timid Bella replied the Irrepressible But perhaps I might have said if I had not been restrained by delicacy towards a sister s feelings that I have for some time felt independent too independent my dear to subject myself to have my intended match you ll prick yourself again George looked down upon It is not that I could have blamed you for looking down upon it when you were looking up to a rich and great match Bella it is only that I was independent Whether the Irrepressible felt slighted by Bella s declaration that she would not quarrel or whether her spitefulness was evoked by Bella s return to the sphere of mister George Sampson s courtship or whether it was a necessary fillip to her spirits that she should come into collision with somebody on the present occasion anyhow she made a dash at her stately parent now with the greatest impetuosity Ma pray don t sit staring at me in that intensely aggravating manner If you see a black on my nose tell me so if you don t leave me alone Do you address Me in those words said missus Wilfer Do you presume Don t talk about presuming Ma for goodness sake A girl who is old enough to be engaged is quite old enough to object to be stared at as if she was a Clock Audacious one said missus Wilfer Your grandmamma if so addressed by one of her daughters at any age would have insisted on her retiring to a dark apartment My grandmamma returned Lavvy folding her arms and leaning back in her chair wouldn t have sat staring people out of countenance I think She would said missus Wilfer Then it s a pity she didn t know better said Lavvy And if my grandmamma wasn t in her dotage when she took to insisting on people s retiring to dark apartments she ought to have been A pretty exhibition my grandmamma must have made of herself I wonder whether she ever insisted on people s retiring into the ball of saint Paul s and if she did how she got them there Silence proclaimed missus Wilfer I command silence I have not the slightest intention of being silent Ma returned Lavinia coolly but quite the contrary I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the Boffins and sit silent under it I am not going to have George Sampson eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins and sit silent under it If Pa thinks proper to be eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins also well and good I don t choose to And I won t Lavinia s engineering having made this crooked opening at Bella missus Wilfer strode into it You rebellious spirit You mutinous child Tell me this Lavinia If in violation of your mother s sentiments you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the Boffins and if you had come from those halls of slavery That s mere nonsense Ma said Lavinia How exclaimed missus Wilfer with sublime severity Halls of slavery Ma is mere stuff and nonsense returned the unmoved Irrepressible I say presumptuous child if you had come from the neighbourhood of Portland Place bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its domestics in glittering garb to visit me do you think my deep seated feelings could have been expressed in looks All I think about it is returned Lavinia that I should wish them expressed to the right person And if pursued her mother if making light of my warnings that the face of missus Boffin alone was a face teeming with evil you had clung to missus Boffin instead of to me and had after all come home rejected by missus Boffin trampled under foot by missus Boffin and cast out by missus Boffin do you think my feelings could have been expressed in looks Lavinia was about replying to her honoured parent that she might as well have dispensed with her looks altogether then when Bella rose and said Good night dear Ma I have had a tiring day and I ll go to bed This broke up the agreeable party mister George Sampson shortly afterwards took his leave accompanied by Miss Lavinia with a candle as far as the hall and without a candle as far as the garden gate missus Wilfer washing her hands of the Boffins went to bed after the manner of Lady Macbeth and R W was left alone among the dilapidations of the supper table in a melancholy attitude But a light footstep roused him from his meditations and it was Bella s Her pretty hair was hanging all about her and she had tripped down softly brush in hand and barefoot to say good night to him My dear you most unquestionably ARE a lovely woman said the cherub taking up a tress in his hand Look here sir said Bella when your lovely woman marries you shall have that piece if you like and she ll make you a chain of it Would you prize that remembrance of the dear creature Yes my precious Then you shall have it if you re good sir I am very very sorry dearest Pa to have brought home all this trouble My pet returned her father in the simplest good faith don t make yourself uneasy about that It really is not worth mentioning because things at home would have taken pretty much the same turn any way If your mother and sister don t find one subject to get at times a little wearing on they find another We re never out of a wearing subject my dear I assure you I am afraid you find your old room with Lavvy dreadfully inconvenient Bella No I don t Pa I don t mind Why don t I mind do you think Pa Well my child you used to complain of it when it wasn t such a contrast as it must be now Upon my word I can only answer because you are so much improved No Pa Because I am so thankful and so happy Here she choked him until her long hair made him sneeze and then she laughed until she made him laugh and then she choked him again that they might not be overheard Listen sir said Bella Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home It won t be a large fortune because if the lovely woman s Intended gets a certain appointment that he hopes to get soon she will marry on a hundred and fifty pounds a year But that s at first and even if it should never be more the lovely woman will make it quite enough But that s not all sir In the fortune there s a certain fair man a little man the fortune teller said who it seems will always find himself near the lovely woman and will always have kept expressly for him such a peaceful corner in the lovely woman s little house as never was Tell me the name of that man sir Is he a Knave in the pack of cards inquired the cherub with a twinkle in his eyes Yes cried Bella in high glee choking him again He s the Knave of Wilfers Dear Pa the lovely woman means to look forward to this fortune that has been told for her so delightfully and to cause it to make her a much better lovely woman than she ever has been yet What the little fair man is expected to do sir is to look forward to it also by saying to himself when he is in danger of being over worried I see land at last I see land at last repeated her father There s a dear Knave of Wilfers exclaimed Bella then putting out her small white bare foot That s the mark sir Come to the mark Put your boot against it We keep to it together mind Now sir you may kiss the lovely woman before she runs away so thankful and so happy O yes fair little man so thankful and so happy Chapter seventeen A SOCIAL CHORUS Amazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of mister and missus Alfred Lammle s circle of acquaintance when the disposal of their first class furniture and effects including a Billiard Table in capital letters by auction under a bill of sale is publicly announced on a waving hearthrug in Sackville Street But nobody is half so much amazed as Hamilton Veneering Esquire M P for Pocket Breaches who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul s register who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world missus Veneering W M P for Pocket Breaches like a faithful wife shares her husband s discovery and inexpressible astonishment Perhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling particularly due to their reputation by reason that once upon a time some of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken themselves when Veneering s extensive dealings and great wealth were mentioned But it is certain that neither mister nor missus Veneering can find words to wonder in and it becomes necessary that they give to the oldest and dearest friends they have in the world a wondering dinner For it is by this time noticeable that whatever befals the Veneerings must give a dinner upon it Lady Tippins lives in a chronic state of invitation to dine with the Veneerings and in a chronic state of inflammation arising from the dinners Boots and Brewer go about in cabs with no other intelligible business on earth than to beat up people to come and dine with the Veneerings Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies intent upon entrapping his fellow legislators to dinner missus Veneering dined with five and twenty bran new faces over night calls upon them all to day sends them every one a dinner card to morrow for the week after next before that dinner is digested calls upon their brothers and sisters their sons and daughters their nephews and nieces their aunts and uncles and cousins and invites them all to dinner And still as at first howsoever the dining circle widens it is to be observed that all the diners are consistent in appearing to go to the Veneerings not to dine with mister and missus Veneering which would seem to be the last thing in their minds but to dine with one another Perhaps after all who knows Veneering may find this dining though expensive remunerative in the sense that it makes champions mister Podsnap as a representative man is not alone in caring very particularly for his own dignity if not for that of his acquaintances and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out his Permit lest in their being lessened he should be The gold and silver camels and the ice pails and the rest of the Veneering table decorations make a brilliant show and when I Podsnap casually remark elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are broken kneed camels or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort I don t display camels myself I am above them I am a more solid man but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance and how dare you sir insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels The camels are polishing up in the Analytical s pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the Lammles going to pieces and mister Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in Duke Street Saint James s in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid day on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box price one and a penny halfpenny government stamp included that the same will be found highly salutary as a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the table To whom while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him A lady says Twemlow pluming his ruffled feathers Ask the favour of the lady s name The lady s name is Lammle The lady will not detain mister Twemlow longer than a very few minutes The lady is sure that mister Twemlow will do her the kindness to see her on being told that she particularly desires a short interview The lady has no doubt whatever of mister Twemlow s compliance when he hears her name Has begged the servant to be particular not to mistake her name Would have sent in a card but has none Show the lady in Lady shown in comes in mister Twemlow s little rooms are modestly furnished in an old fashioned manner rather like the housekeeper s room at Snigsworthy Park and would be bare of mere ornament were it not for a full length engraving of the sublime Snigsworth over the chimneypiece snorting at a Corinthian column with an enormous roll of paper at his feet and a heavy curtain going to tumble down on his head those accessories being understood to represent the noble lord as somehow in the act of saving his country Pray take a seat missus Lammle missus Lammle takes a seat and opens the conversation I have no doubt mister Twemlow that you have heard of a reverse of fortune having befallen us Of course you have heard of it for no kind of news travels so fast among one s friends especially Mindful of the wondering dinner Twemlow with a little twinge admits the imputation Probably it will not says missus Lammle with a certain hardened manner upon her that makes Twemlow shrink have surprised you so much as some others after what passed between us at the house which is now turned out at windows I have taken the liberty of calling upon you mister Twemlow to add a sort of postscript to what I said that day mister Twemlow s dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the prospect of some new complication Really says the uneasy little gentleman really missus Lammle I should take it as a favour if you could excuse me from any further confidence It has ever been one of the objects of my life which unfortunately has not had many objects to be inoffensive and to keep out of cabals and interferences missus Lammle by far the more observant of the two scarcely finds it necessary to look at Twemlow while he speaks so easily does she read him My postscript to retain the term I have used says missus Lammle fixing her eyes on his face to enforce what she says herself coincides exactly with what you say mister Twemlow So far from troubling you with any new confidence I merely wish to remind you what the old one was So far from asking you for interference I merely wish to claim your strict neutrality Twemlow going on to reply she rests her eyes again knowing her ears to be quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel I can I suppose says Twemlow nervously offer no reasonable objection to hearing anything that you do me the honour to wish to say to me under those heads But if I may with all possible delicacy and politeness entreat you not to range beyond them I I beg to do so Sir says missus Lammle raising her eyes to his face again and quite daunting him with her hardened manner I imparted to you a certain piece of knowledge to be imparted again as you thought best to a certain person Which I did says Twemlow And for doing which I thank you though indeed I scarcely know why I turned traitress to my husband in the matter for the girl is a poor little fool I was a poor little fool once myself I can find no better reason Seeing the effect she produces on him by her indifferent laugh and cold look she keeps her eyes upon him as she proceeds mister Twemlow if you should chance to see my husband or to see me or to see both of us in the favour or confidence of any one else whether of our common acquaintance or not is of no consequence you have no right to use against us the knowledge I intrusted you with for one special purpose which has been accomplished This is what I came to say It is not a stipulation to a gentleman it is simply a reminder Twemlow sits murmuring to himself with his hand to his forehead It is so plain a case missus Lammle goes on as between me from the first relying on your honour and you that I will not waste another word upon it She looks steadily at mister Twemlow until with a shrug he makes her a little one sided bow as though saying Yes I think you have a right to rely upon me and then she moistens her lips and shows a sense of relief I trust I have kept the promise I made through your servant that I would detain you a very few minutes I need trouble you no longer mister Twemlow Stay says Twemlow rising as she rises Pardon me a moment I should never have sought you out madam to say what I am going to say but since you have sought me out and are here I will throw it off my mind Was it quite consistent in candour with our taking that resolution against mister Fledgeby that you should afterwards address mister Fledgeby as your dear and confidential friend and entreat a favour of mister Fledgeby Always supposing that you did I assert no knowledge of my own on the subject it has been represented to me that you did Then he told you retorts missus Lammle who again has saved her eyes while listening and uses them with strong effect while speaking Yes It is strange that he should have told you the truth says missus Lammle seriously pondering Pray where did a circumstance so very extraordinary happen Twemlow hesitates He is shorter than the lady as well as weaker and as she stands above him with her hardened manner and her well used eyes he finds himself at such a disadvantage that he would like to be of the opposite sex May I ask where it happened mister Twemlow In strict confidence I must confess says the mild little gentleman coming to his answer by degrees that I felt some compunctions when mister Fledgeby mentioned it I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light More particularly as mister Fledgeby did with great civility which I could not feel that I deserved from him render me the same service that you had entreated him to render you It is a part of the true nobility of the poor gentleman s soul to say this last sentence Otherwise he has reflected I shall assume the superior position of having no difficulties of my own while I know of hers Which would be mean very mean Was mister Fledgeby s advocacy as effectual in your case as in ours missus Lammle demands As ineffectual Can you make up your mind to tell me where you saw mister Fledgeby mister Twemlow I beg your pardon I fully intended to have done so The reservation was not intentional I encountered mister Fledgeby quite by accident on the spot By the expression on the spot I mean at mister Riah s in Saint Mary Axe Have you the misfortune to be in mister Riah s hands then Unfortunately madam returns Twemlow the one money obligation to which I stand committed the one debt of my life but it is a just debt pray observe that I don t dispute it has fallen into mister Riah s hands mister Twemlow says missus Lammle fixing his eyes with hers which he would prevent her doing if he could but he can t it has fallen into mister Fledgeby s hands mister Riah is his mask It has fallen into mister Fledgeby s hands Let me tell you that for your guidance The information may be of use to you if only to prevent your credulity in judging another man s truthfulness by your own from being imposed upon Impossible cries Twemlow standing aghast How do you know it I scarcely know how I know it The whole train of circumstances seemed to take fire at once and show it to me Oh Then you have no proof It is very strange says missus Lammle coldly and boldly and with some disdain how like men are to one another in some things though their characters are as different as can be No two men can have less affinity between them one would say than mister Twemlow and my husband Yet my husband replies to me You have no proof and mister Twemlow replies to me with the very same words But why madam Twemlow ventures gently to argue Consider why the very same words Because they state the fact Because you HAVE no proof Men are very wise in their way quoth missus Lammle glancing haughtily at the Snigsworth portrait and shaking out her dress before departing but they have wisdom to learn My husband who is not over confiding ingenuous or inexperienced sees this plain thing no more than mister Twemlow does because there is no proof Yet I believe five women out of six in my place would see it as clearly as I do However I will never rest if only in remembrance of mister Fledgeby s having kissed my hand until my husband does see it And you will do well for yourself to see it from this time forth mister Twemlow though I CAN give you no proof As she moves towards the door mister Twemlow attending on her expresses his soothing hope that the condition of mister Lammle s affairs is not irretrievable I don t know missus Lammle answers stopping and sketching out the pattern of the paper on the wall with the point of her parasol it depends There may be an opening for him dawning now or there may be none We shall soon find out If none we are bankrupt here and must go abroad I suppose mister Twemlow in his good natured desire to make the best of it remarks that there are pleasant lives abroad Yes returns missus Lammle still sketching on the wall but I doubt whether billiard playing card playing and so forth for the means to live under suspicion at a dirty table d hote is one of them It is much for mister Lammle Twemlow politely intimates though greatly shocked to have one always beside him who is attached to him in all his fortunes and whose restraining influence will prevent him from courses that would be discreditable and ruinous As he says it missus Lammle leaves off sketching and looks at him Restraining influence mister Twemlow We must eat and drink and dress and have a roof over our heads Always beside him and attached in all his fortunes Not much to boast of in that what can a woman at my age do My husband and I deceived one another when we married we must bear the consequences of the deception that is to say bear one another and bear the burden of scheming together for to day s dinner and to morrow s breakfast till death divorces us With those words she walks out into Duke Street Saint James s mister Twemlow returning to his sofa lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table But six o clock in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman getting better and also getting himself into his obsolete little silk stockings and pumps for the wondering dinner at the Veneerings And seven o clock in the evening finds him trotting out into Duke Street to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach hire Tippins the divine has dined herself into such a condition by this time that a morbid mind might desire her for a blessed change to sup at last and turn into bed Such a mind has mister Eugene Wrayburn whom Twemlow finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack Skittish is Tippins with Mortimer Lightwood too and has raps to give him with her fan for having been best man at the nuptials of these deceiving what s their names who have gone to pieces Though indeed the fan is generally lively and taps away at the men in all directions with something of a grisly sound suggestive of the clattering of Lady Tippins s bones A new race of intimate friends has sprung up at Veneering s since he went into Parliament for the public good to whom missus Veneering is very attentive These friends like astronomical distances are only to be spoken of in the very largest figures Boots says that one of them is a Contractor who it has been calculated gives employment directly and indirectly to five hundred thousand men Brewer says that another of them is a Chairman in such request at so many Boards so far apart that he never travels less by railway than three thousand miles a week Buffer says that another of them hadn t a sixpence eighteen months ago and through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty five and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash has now three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy five and declining to take a farthing less With Buffer Boots and Brewer Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip Church surveying them through her eyeglass and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them with other pleasantries of that nature Veneering in his different way is much occupied with the Fathers too piously retiring with them into the conservatory from which retreat the word Committee is occasionally heard and where the Fathers instruct Veneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left take the level of the mantelpiece cross by an open cutting at the candelabra seize the carrying traffic at the console and cut up the opposition root and branch at the window curtains mister and missus Podsnap are of the company and the Fathers descry in missus Podsnap a fine woman She is consigned to a Father Boots s Father who employs five hundred thousand men and is brought to anchor on Veneering s left thus affording opportunity to the sportive Tippins on his right he as usual being mere vacant space to entreat to be told something about those loves of Navvies and whether they really do live on raw beefsteaks and drink porter out of their barrows But in spite of such little skirmishes it is felt that this was to be a wondering dinner and that the wondering must not be neglected Accordingly Brewer as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain becomes the interpreter of the general instinct I took says Brewer in a favourable pause a cab this morning and I rattled off to that Sale Boots devoured by envy says So did I Buffer says So did I but can find nobody to care whether he did or not And what was it like inquires Veneering I assure you replies Brewer looking about for anybody else to address his answer to and giving the preference to Lightwood I assure you the things were going for a song Handsome things enough but fetching nothing So I heard this afternoon says Lightwood Brewer begs to know now would it be fair to ask a professional man how on earth these people ever did come TO such A total smash Brewer s divisions being for emphasis Lightwood replies that he was consulted certainly but could give no opinion which would pay off the Bill of Sale and therefore violates no confidence in supposing that it came of their living beyond their means But how says Veneering CAN people do that Hah That is felt on all hands to be a shot in the bull s eye How CAN people do that The Analytical Chemist going round with champagne looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that if he had a mind How says missus Veneering laying down her fork to press her aquiline hands together at the tips of the fingers and addressing the Father who travels the three thousand miles per week how a mother can look at her baby and know that she lives beyond her husband s means I cannot imagine Eugene suggests that missus Lammle not being a mother had no baby to look at True says missus Veneering but the principle is the same Boots is clear that the principle is the same So is Buffer It is the unfortunate destiny of Buffer to damage a cause by espousing it The rest of the company have meekly yielded to the proposition that the principle is the same until Buffer says it is when instantly a general murmur arises that the principle is not the same But I don t understand says the Father of the three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds if these people spoken of occupied the position of being in society they were in society Veneering is bound to confess that they dined here and were even married from here Then I don t understand pursues the Father how even their living beyond their means could bring them to what has been termed a total smash Because there is always such a thing as an adjustment of affairs in the case of people of any standing at all Eugene who would seem to be in a gloomy state of suggestiveness suggests Suppose you have no means and live beyond them This is too insolvent a state of things for the Father to entertain It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self respect to entertain and is universally scouted But it is so amazing how any people can have come to a total smash that everybody feels bound to account for it specially One of the Fathers says Gaming table Another of the Fathers says Speculated without knowing that speculation is a science Boots says Horses Lady Tippins says to her fan Two establishments mister Podsnap saying nothing is referred to for his opinion which he delivers as follows much flushed and extremely angry Don t ask me I desire to take no part in the discussion of these people s affairs I abhor the subject It is an odious subject an offensive subject a subject that makes me sick and I And with his favourite right arm flourish which sweeps away everything and settles it for ever mister Podsnap sweeps these inconveniently unexplainable wretches who have lived beyond their means and gone to total smash off the face of the universe Eugene leaning back in his chair is observing mister Podsnap with an irreverent face and may be about to offer a new suggestion when the Analytical is beheld in collision with the Coachman the Coachman manifesting a purpose of coming at the company with a silver salver as though intent upon making a collection for his wife and family the Analytical cutting him off at the sideboard The superior stateliness if not the superior generalship of the Analytical prevails over a man who is as nothing off the box and the Coachman yielding up his salver retires defeated Then the Analytical perusing a scrap of paper lying on the salver with the air of a literary Censor adjusts it takes his time about going to the table with it and presents it to mister Eugene Wrayburn Whereupon the pleasant Tippins says aloud The Lord Chancellor has resigned With distracting coolness and slowness for he knows the curiosity of the Charmer to be always devouring Eugene makes a pretence of getting out an eyeglass polishing it and reading the paper with difficulty long after he has seen what is written on it What is written on it in wet ink is Young Blight Waiting says Eugene over his shoulder in confidence with the Analytical Waiting returns the Analytical in responsive confidence Eugene looks Excuse me towards missus Veneering goes out and finds Young Blight Mortimer s clerk at the hall door You told me to bring him sir to wherever you was if he come while you was out and I was in says that discreet young gentleman standing on tiptoe to whisper and I ve brought him Sharp boy Where is he asks Eugene He s in a cab sir at the door I thought it best not to show him you see if it could be helped for he s a shaking all over like Blight s simile is perhaps inspired by the surrounding dishes of sweets like Glue Monge Sharp boy again returns Eugene I ll go to him Goes out straightway and leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting looks in at mister Dolls who has brought his own atmosphere with him and would seem from its odour to have brought it for convenience of carriage in a rum cask Now Dolls wake up Mist Wrayburn Drection Fifteen shillings After carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket Eugene tells out the money beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into mister Dolls s hand which instantly jerks it out of window and ending by telling the fifteen shillings on the seat Give him a ride back to Charing Cross sharp boy and there get rid of him Returning to the dining room and pausing for an instant behind the screen at the door Eugene overhears above the hum and clatter the fair Tippins saying I am dying to ask him what he was called out for Are you mutters Eugene then perhaps if you can t ask him you ll die So I ll be a benefactor to society and go A stroll and a cigar and I can think this over Think this over Thus with a thoughtful face he finds his hat and cloak unseen of the Analytical and goes his way BOOK THE FOURTH A TURNING Chapter one SETTING TRAPS Plashwater Weir Mill Lock looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the summer time A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh green trees and passed like a smooth shadow over the river and like a smoother shadow over the yielding grass The voice of the falling water like the voices of the sea and the wind were as an outer memory to a contemplative listener but not particularly so to mister Riderhood who sat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock gates dozing Wine must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out and the wine of sentiment never having been got into mister Riderhood by any agency nothing in nature tapped him As the Rogue sat ever and again nodding himself off his balance his recovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl as if in the absence of any one else he had aggressive inclinations towards himself In one of these starts the cry of Lock ho Lock prevented his relapse into a doze Shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute he was he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end and turned his face down stream to see who hailed It was an amateur sculler well up to his work though taking it easily in so light a boat that the Rogue remarked A little less on you and you d a most ha been a Wagerbut then went to work at his windlass handles and sluices to let the sculler in As the latter stood in his boat holding on by the boat hook to the woodwork at the lock side waiting for the gates to open Rogue Riderhood recognized his T other governor mister Eugene Wrayburn who was however too indifferent or too much engaged to recognize him The creaking lock gates opened slowly and the light boat passed in as soon as there was room enough and the creaking lock gates closed upon it and it floated low down in the dock between the two sets of gates until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it out When Riderhood had run to his second windlass and turned it and while he leaned against the lever of that gate to help it to swing open presently he noticed lying to rest under the green hedge by the towing path astern of the Lock a Bargeman The water rose and rose as the sluice poured in dispersing the scum which had formed behind the lumbering gates and sending the boat up so that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the bargeman s point of view Riderhood observed that the bargeman rose too leaning on his arm and seemed to have his eyes fastened on the rising figure But there was the toll to be taken as the gates were now complaining and opening The T other governor tossed it ashore twisted in a piece of paper and as he did so knew his man Ay ay It s you is it honest friend said Eugene seating himself preparatory to resuming his sculls You got the place then I got the place and no thanks to you for it nor yet none to Lawyer Lightwood gruffly answered Riderhood We saved our recommendation honest fellow said Eugene for the next candidate the one who will offer himself when you are transported or hanged Don t be long about it will you be so good So imperturbable was the air with which he gravely bent to his work that Riderhood remained staring at him without having found a retort until he had rowed past a line of wooden objects by the weir which showed like huge teetotums standing at rest in the water and was almost hidden by the drooping boughs on the left bank as he rowed away keeping out of the opposing current It being then too late to retort with any effect if that could ever have been done the honest man confined himself to cursing and growling in a grim under tone Having then got his gates shut he crossed back by his plank lock bridge to the towing path side of the river If in so doing he took another glance at the bargeman he did it by stealth He cast himself on the grass by the Lock side in an indolent way with his back in that direction and having gathered a few blades fell to chewing them The dip of Eugene Wrayburn s sculls had become hardly audible in his ears when the bargeman passed him putting the utmost width that he could between them and keeping under the hedge Then Riderhood sat up and took a long look at his figure and then cried Hi I i Lock ho Lock Plashwater Weir Mill Lock The bargeman stopped and looked back Plashwater Weir Mill Lock T otherest gov er nor or or or cried mister Riderhood with his hands to his mouth The bargeman turned back Approaching nearer and nearer the bargeman became Bradley Headstone in rough water side second hand clothing Wish I may die said Riderhood smiting his right leg and laughing as he sat on the grass if you ain t ha been a imitating me T otherest governor Never thought myself so good looking afore Truly Bradley Headstone had taken careful note of the honest man s dress in the course of that night walk they had had together He must have committed it to memory and slowly got it by heart It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore And whereas in his own schoolmaster clothes he usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man he now looked in the clothes of some other man or men as if they were his own THIS your Lock said Bradley whose surprise had a genuine air they told me where I last inquired it was the third I should come to This is only the second It s my belief governor returned Riderhood with a wink and shake of his head that you ve dropped one in your counting It ain t Locks as YOU VE been giving your mind to No no As he expressively jerked his pointing finger in the direction the boat had taken a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley s face and he looked anxiously up the river It ain t Locks as YOU VE been a reckoning up said Riderhood when the schoolmaster s eyes came back again No no What other calculations do you suppose I have been occupied with Mathematics I never heerd it called that It s a long word for it Hows ever p raps you call it so said Riderhood stubbornly chewing his grass It What I ll say them instead of it if you like was the coolly growled reply It s safer talk too What do you mean that I should understand by them Spites affronts offences giv and took deadly aggrawations such like answered Riderhood Do what Bradley Headstone would he could not keep that former flush of impatience out of his face or so master his eyes as to prevent their again looking anxiously up the river Ha ha Don t be afeerd T otherest said Riderhood The T other s got to make way agin the stream and he takes it easy You can soon come up with him But wot s the good of saying that to you YOU know how fur you could have outwalked him betwixt anywheres about where he lost the tide say Richmond and this if you had a mind to it You think I have been following him said Bradley I KNOW you have said Riderhood Well I have I have Bradley admitted But with another anxious look up the river he may land Easy you He won t be lost if he does land said Riderhood He must leave his boat behind him He can t make a bundle or a parcel on it and carry it ashore with him under his arm He was speaking to you just now said Bradley kneeling on one knee on the grass beside the Lock keeper What did he say Cheek said Riderhood What Cheek repeated Riderhood with an angry oath cheek is what he said He can t say nothing but cheek I d ha liked to plump down aboard of him neck and crop with a heavy jump and sunk him Bradley turned away his haggard face for a few moments and then said tearing up a tuft of grass Damn him Hooroar cried Riderhood Does you credit Hooroar I cry chorus to the T otherest What turn said Bradley with an effort at self repression that forced him to wipe his face did his insolence take to day It took the turn answered Riderhood with sullen ferocity of hoping as I was getting ready to be hanged Let him look to that cried Bradley Let him look to that It will be bad for him when men he has injured and at whom he has jeered are thinking of getting hanged Let HIM get ready for HIS fate when that comes about There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of or he wouldn t have had brains enough to say it Let him look to it let him look to it When men he has wronged and on whom he has bestowed his insolence are getting ready to be hanged there is a death bell ringing And not for them Riderhood looking fixedly at him gradually arose from his recumbent posture while the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost concentration of rage and hatred So when the words were all spoken he too kneeled on one knee on the grass and the two men looked at one another Oh said Riderhood very deliberately spitting out the grass he had been chewing Then I make out T otherest as he is a going to her He left London answered Bradley yesterday I have hardly a doubt this time that at last he is going to her You ain t sure then I am as sure here said Bradley with a clutch at the breast of his coarse shirt as if it was written there with a blow or a stab at the sky Ah But judging from the looks on you retorted Riderhood completely ridding himself of his grass and drawing his sleeve across his mouth you ve made ekally sure afore and have got disapinted It has told upon you Listen said Bradley in a low voice bending forward to lay his hand upon the Lock keeper s shoulder These are my holidays Are they by George muttered Riderhood with his eyes on the passion wasted face Your working days must be stiff uns if these is your holidays And I have never left him pursued Bradley waving the interruption aside with an impatient hand since they began And I never will leave him now till I have seen him with her And when you have seen him with her said Riderhood I ll come back to you Riderhood stiffened the knee on which he had been resting got up and looked gloomily at his new friend After a few moments they walked side by side in the direction the boat had taken as if by tacit consent Bradley pressing forward and Riderhood holding back Bradley getting out his neat prim purse into his hand a present made him by penny subscription among his pupils and Riderhood unfolding his arms to smear his coat cuff across his mouth with a thoughtful air I have a pound for you said Bradley You ve two said Riderhood Bradley held a sovereign between his fingers Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing path Riderhood held his left hand open with a certain slight drawing action towards himself Bradley dipped in his purse for another sovereign and two chinked in Riderhood s hand the drawing action of which promptly strengthening drew them home to his pocket Now I must follow him said Bradley Headstone He takes this river road the fool to confuse observation or divert attention if not solely to baffle me But he must have the power of making himself invisible before he can shake Me off Riderhood stopped If you don t get disapinted agin T otherest maybe you ll put up at the Lock house when you come back I will Riderhood nodded and the figure of the bargeman went its way along the soft turf by the side of the towing path keeping near the hedge and moving quickly They had turned a point from which a long stretch of river was visible A stranger to the scene might have been certain that here and there along the line of hedge a figure stood watching the bargeman and waiting for him to come up So he himself had often believed at first until his eyes became used to the posts bearing the dagger that slew Wat Tyler in the City of London shield Within mister Riderhood s knowledge all daggers were as one Even to Bradley Headstone who could have told to the letter without book all about Wat Tyler Lord Mayor Walworth and the King that it is dutiful for youth to know there was but one subject living in the world for every sharp destructive instrument that summer evening So Riderhood looking after him as he went and he with his furtive hand laid upon the dagger as he passed it and his eyes upon the boat were much upon a par The boat went on under the arching trees and over their tranquil shadows in the water The bargeman skulking on the opposite bank of the stream went on after it Sparkles of light showed Riderhood when and where the rower dipped his blades until even as he stood idly watching the sun went down and the landscape was dyed red And then the red had the appearance of fading out of it and mounting up to Heaven as we say that blood guiltily shed does Turning back towards his Lock he had not gone out of view of it the Rogue pondered as deeply as it was within the contracted power of such a fellow to do Why did he copy my clothes He could have looked like what he wanted to look like without that This was the subject matter in his thoughts in which too there came lumbering up by times like any half floating and half sinking rubbish in the river the question Was it done by accident The setting of a trap for finding out whether it was accidentally done soon superseded as a practical piece of cunning the abstruser inquiry why otherwise it was done And he devised a means Rogue Riderhood went into his Lock house and brought forth into the now sober grey light his chest of clothes Sitting on the grass beside it he turned out one by one the articles it contained until he came to a conspicuous bright red neckerchief stained black here and there by wear It arrested his attention and he sat pausing over it until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat and substituted the red neckerchief leaving the long ends flowing Now said the Rogue if arter he sees me in this neckhankecher I see him in a sim lar neckhankecher it won t be accident Elated by his device he carried his chest in again and went to supper Lock ho Lock It was a light night and a barge coming down summoned him out of a long doze In due course he had let the barge through and was alone again looking to the closing of his gates when Bradley Headstone appeared before him standing on the brink of the Lock Halloa said Riderhood Back a ready T otherest He has put up for the night at an Angler s Inn was the fatigued and hoarse reply He goes on up the river at six in the morning I have come back for a couple of hours rest You want em said Riderhood making towards the schoolmaster by his plank bridge I don t want them returned Bradley irritably because I would rather not have them but would much prefer to follow him all night However if he won t lead I can t follow I have been waiting about until I could discover for a certainty at what time he starts if I couldn t have made sure of it I should have stayed there This would be a bad pit for a man to be flung into with his hands tied These slippery smooth walls would give him no chance And I suppose those gates would suck him down Suck him down or swaller him up he wouldn t get out said Riderhood Not even if his hands warn t tied he wouldn t Shut him in at both ends and I d give him a pint o old ale ever to come up to me standing here Bradley looked down with a ghastly relish You run about the brink and run across it in this uncertain light on a few inches width of rotten wood said he I wonder you have no thought of being drowned I can t be said Riderhood You can t be drowned No said Riderhood shaking his head with an air of thorough conviction it s well known I ve been brought out o drowning and I can t be drowned I wouldn t have that there busted B lowbridger aware on it or her people might make it tell agin the damages I mean to get But it s well known to water side characters like myself that him as has been brought out o drowning can never be drowned Bradley smiled sourly at the ignorance he would have corrected in one of his pupils and continued to look down into the water as if the place had a gloomy fascination for him You seem to like it said Riderhood He took no notice but stood looking down as if he had not heard the words There was a very dark expression on his face an expression that the Rogue found it hard to understand It was fierce and full of purpose but the purpose might have been as much against himself as against another If he had stepped back for a spring taken a leap and thrown himself in it would have been no surprising sequel to the look Perhaps his troubled soul set upon some violence did hover for the moment between that violence and another Didn t you say asked Riderhood after watching him for a while with a sidelong glance as you had come back for a couple o hours rest But even then he had to jog him with his elbow before he answered Eh Yes Hadn t you better come in and take your couple o hours rest Thank you Yes With the look of one just awakened he followed Riderhood into the Lock house where the latter produced from a cupboard some cold salt beef and half a loaf some gin in a bottle and some water in a jug The last he brought in cool and dripping from the river There T otherest said Riderhood stooping over him to put it on the table You d better take a bite and a sup afore you takes your snooze The draggling ends of the red neckerchief caught the schoolmaster s eyes Riderhood saw him look at it Oh thought that worthy You re a taking notice are you Come You shall have a good squint at it then With which reflection he sat down on the other side of the table threw open his vest and made a pretence of re tying the neckerchief with much deliberation Bradley ate and drank As he sat at his platter and mug Riderhood saw him again and yet again steal a look at the neckerchief as if he were correcting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory When you re ready for your snooze said that honest creature chuck yourself on my bed in the corner T otherest It ll be broad day afore three I ll call you early I shall require no calling answered Bradley And soon afterwards divesting himself only of his shoes and coat laid himself down Riderhood leaning back in his wooden arm chair with his arms folded on his breast looked at him lying with his right hand clenched in his sleep and his teeth set until a film came over his own sight and he slept too He awoke to find that it was daylight and that his visitor was already astir and going out to the river side to cool his head Though I m blest muttered Riderhood at the Lock house door looking after him if I think there s water enough in all the Thames to do THAT for you Within five minutes he had taken his departure and was passing on into the calm distance as he had passed yesterday Riderhood knew when a fish leaped by his starting and glancing round Lock ho Lock at intervals all day and Lock ho Lock thrice in the ensuing night but no return of Bradley The second day was sultry and oppressive In the afternoon a thunderstorm came up and had but newly broken into a furious sweep of rain when he rushed in at the door like the storm itself You ve seen him with her exclaimed Riderhood starting up I have Where At his journey s end His boat s hauled up for three days I heard him give the order Then I saw him wait for her and meet her I saw them he stopped as though he were suffocating and began again I saw them walking side by side last night What did you do Nothing What are you going to do He dropped into a chair and laughed Immediately afterwards a great spirt of blood burst from his nose How does that happen asked Riderhood I don t know I can t keep it back It has happened twice three times four times I don t know how many times since last night I taste it smell it see it it chokes me and then it breaks out like this He went into the pelting rain again with his head bare and bending low over the river and scooping up the water with his two hands washed the blood away All beyond his figure as Riderhood looked from the door was a vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards one quarter of the heavens He raised his head and came back wet from head to foot but with the lower parts of his sleeves where he had dipped into the river streaming water Your face is like a ghost s said Riderhood Did you ever see a ghost was the sullen retort I mean to say you re quite wore out That may well be I have had no rest since I left here I don t remember that I have so much as sat down since I left here Lie down now then said Riderhood I will if you ll give me something to quench my thirst first The bottle and jug were again produced and he mixed a weak draught and another and drank both in quick succession You asked me something he said then No I didn t replied Riderhood I tell you retorted Bradley turning upon him in a wild and desperate manner you asked me something before I went out to wash my face in the river Oh Then said Riderhood backing a little I asked you wot you wos a going to do How can a man in this state know he answered protesting with both his tremulous hands with an action so vigorously angry that he shook the water from his sleeves upon the floor as if he had wrung them How can I plan anything if I haven t sleep Why that s what I as good as said returned the other Didn t I say lie down Well perhaps you did Well Anyways I says it again Sleep where you slept last the sounder and longer you can sleep the better you ll know arterwards what you re up to His pointing to the truckle bed in the corner seemed gradually to bring that poor couch to Bradley s wandering remembrance He slipped off his worn down trodden shoes and cast himself heavily all wet as he was upon the bed Riderhood sat down in his wooden arm chair and looked through the window at the lightning and listened to the thunder But his thoughts were far from being absorbed by the thunder and the lightning for again and again and again he looked very curiously at the exhausted man upon the bed The man had turned up the collar of the rough coat he wore to shelter himself from the storm and had buttoned it about his neck Unconscious of that and of most things he had left the coat so both when he had laved his face in the river and when he had cast himself upon the bed though it would have been much easier to him if he had unloosened it The thunder rolled heavily and the forked lightning seemed to make jagged rents in every part of the vast curtain without as Riderhood sat by the window glancing at the bed Sometimes he saw the man upon the bed by a red light sometimes by a blue sometimes he scarcely saw him in the darkness of the storm sometimes he saw nothing of him in the blinding glare of palpitating white fire Anon the rain would come again with a tremendous rush and the river would seem to rise to meet it and a blast of wind bursting upon the door would flutter the hair and dress of the man as if invisible messengers were come around the bed to carry him away From all these phases of the storm Riderhood would turn as if they were interruptions rather striking interruptions possibly but interruptions still of his scrutiny of the sleeper He sleeps sound he said within himself yet he s that up to me and that noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him when a rattling peal won t let alone my touching of him He very cautiously rose to his feet T otherest he said in a low calm voice are you a lying easy There s a chill in the air governor Shall I put a coat over you No answer That s about what it is a ready you see muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice a coat over you a coat over you The sleeper moving an arm he sat down again in his chair and feigned to watch the storm from the window It was a grand spectacle but not so grand as to keep his eyes for half a minute together from stealing a look at the man upon the bed It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead tired in mind and body Then Riderhood came from the window cautiously and stood by the bed Poor man he murmured in a low tone with a crafty face and a very watchful eye and ready foot lest he should start up this here coat of his must make him uneasy in his sleep Shall I loosen it for him and make him more comfortable Ah I think I ought to do it poor man I think I will He touched the first button with a very cautious hand and a step backward But the sleeper remaining in profound unconsciousness he touched the other buttons with a more assured hand and perhaps the more lightly on that account Softly and slowly he opened the coat and drew it back The draggling ends of a bright red neckerchief were then disclosed and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid to give it the appearance of having become stained by wear With a much perplexed face Riderhood looked from it to the sleeper and from the sleeper to it and finally crept back to his chair and there with his hand to his chin sat long in a brown study looking at both Chapter two THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN RISES A LITTLE mister and missus Lammle had come to breakfast with mister and missus Boffin They were not absolutely uninvited but had pressed themselves with so much urgency on the golden couple that evasion of the honour and pleasure of their company would have been difficult if desired They were in a charming state of mind were mister and missus Lammle and almost as fond of mister and missus Boffin as of one another My dear missus Boffin said missus Lammle it imparts new life to me to see my Alfred in confidential communication with mister Boffin The two were formed to become intimate So much simplicity combined with so much force of character such natural sagacity united to such amiability and gentleness these are the distinguishing characteristics of both This being said aloud gave mister Lammle an opportunity as he came with mister Boffin from the window to the breakfast table of taking up his dear and honoured wife My Sophronia said that gentleman your too partial estimate of your husband s character No Not too partial Alfred urged the lady tenderly moved never say that My child your favourable opinion then of your husband you don t object to that phrase darling How can I Alfred Your favourable opinion then my Precious does less than justice to mister Boffin and more than justice to me To the first charge Alfred I plead guilty But to the second oh no no Less than justice to mister Boffin Sophronia said mister Lammle soaring into a tone of moral grandeur because it represents mister Boffin as on my lower level more than justice to me Sophronia because it represents me as on mister Boffin s higher level mister Boffin bears and forbears far more than I could Far more than you could for yourself Alfred My love that is not the question Not the question Lawyer said missus Lammle archly No dear Sophronia From my lower level I regard mister Boffin as too generous as possessed of too much clemency as being too good to persons who are unworthy of him and ungrateful to him To those noble qualities I can lay no claim On the contrary they rouse my indignation when I see them in action Alfred They rouse my indignation my dear against the unworthy persons and give me a combative desire to stand between mister Boffin and all such persons Why Because in my lower nature I am more worldly and less delicate Not being so magnanimous as mister Boffin I feel his injuries more than he does himself and feel more capable of opposing his injurers It struck missus Lammle that it appeared rather difficult this morning to bring mister and missus Boffin into agreeable conversation Here had been several lures thrown out and neither of them had uttered a word Here were she missus Lammle and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively but discoursing alone Assuming that the dear old creatures were impressed by what they heard still one would like to be sure of it the more so as at least one of the dear old creatures was somewhat pointedly referred to If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it But is not my husband saying in effect asked missus Lammle therefore with an innocent air of mister and missus Boffin that he becomes unmindful of his own temporary misfortunes in his admiration of another whom he is burning to serve And is not that making an admission that his nature is a generous one I am wretched in argument but surely this is so dear mister and missus Boffin Still neither mister and missus Boffin said a word He sat with his eyes on his plate eating his muffins and ham and she sat shyly looking at the teapot missus Lammle s innocent appeal was merely thrown into the air to mingle with the steam of the urn Glancing towards mister and missus Boffin she very slightly raised her eyebrows as though inquiring of her husband Do I notice anything wrong here mister Lammle who had found his chest effective on a variety of occasions manoeuvred his capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration possible and then smiling retorted on his wife thus Sophronia darling mister and missus Boffin will remind you of the old adage that self praise is no recommendation Self praise Alfred Do you mean because we are one and the same No my dear child I mean that you cannot fail to remember if you reflect for a single moment that what you are pleased to compliment me upon feeling in the case of mister Boffin you have yourself confided to me as your own feeling in the case of missus Boffin I shall be beaten by this Lawyer missus Lammle gaily whispered to missus Boffin I am afraid I must admit it if he presses me for it s damagingly true Several white dints began to come and go about mister Lammle s nose as he observed that missus Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for a moment with an embarrassed smile which was no smile and then looked down again Do you admit the charge Sophronia inquired Alfred in a rallying tone Really I think said missus Lammle still gaily I must throw myself on the protection of the Court Am I bound to answer that question my Lord To mister Boffin You needn t if you don t like ma am was his answer It s not of the least consequence Both husband and wife glanced at him very doubtfully His manner was grave but not coarse and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation Again missus Lammle raised her eyebrows for instruction from her husband He replied in a slight nod Try em again To protect myself against the suspicion of covert self laudation my dear missus Boffin said the airy missus Lammle therefore I must tell you how it was No Pray don t mister Boffin interposed missus Lammle turned to him laughingly The Court objects Ma am said mister Boffin the Court if I am the Court does object The Court objects for two reasons First because the Court don t think it fair Secondly because the dear old lady missus Court if I am mister gets distressed by it A very remarkable wavering between two bearings between her propitiatory bearing there and her defiant bearing at mister Twemlow s was observable on the part of missus Lammle as she said What does the Court not consider fair Letting you go on replied mister Boffin nodding his head soothingly as who should say We won t be harder on you than we can help we ll make the best of it It s not above board and it s not fair When the old lady is uncomfortable there s sure to be good reason for it I see she is uncomfortable and I plainly see this is the good reason wherefore HAVE you breakfasted ma am missus Lammle settling into her defiant manner pushed her plate away looked at her husband and laughed but by no means gaily Have YOU breakfasted sir inquired mister Boffin Thank you replied Alfred showing all his teeth If missus Boffin will oblige me I ll take another cup of tea He spilled a little of it over the chest which ought to have been so effective and which had done so little but on the whole drank it with something of an air though the coming and going dints got almost as large the while as if they had been made by pressure of the teaspoon A thousand thanks he then observed I have breakfasted Now which said mister Boffin softly taking out a pocket book which of you two is Cashier Sophronia my dear remarked her husband as he leaned back in his chair waving his right hand towards her while he hung his left hand by the thumb in the arm hole of his waistcoat it shall be your department I would rather said mister Boffin that it was your husband s ma am because but never mind because I would rather have to do with him However what I have to say I will say with as little offence as possible if I can say it without any I shall be heartily glad You two have done me a service a very great service in doing what you did my old lady knows what it was and I have put into this envelope a bank note for a hundred pound I consider the service well worth a hundred pound and I am well pleased to pay the money Would you do me the favour to take it and likewise to accept my thanks With a haughty action and without looking towards him missus Lammle held out her left hand and into it mister Boffin put the little packet When she had conveyed it to her bosom mister Lammle had the appearance of feeling relieved and breathing more freely as not having been quite certain that the hundred pounds were his until the note had been safely transferred out of mister Boffin s keeping into his own Sophronia s It is not impossible said mister Boffin addressing Alfred that you have had some general idea sir of replacing Rokesmith in course of time It is not assented Alfred with a glittering smile and a great deal of nose not impossible And perhaps ma am pursued mister Boffin addressing Sophronia you have been so kind as to take up my old lady in your own mind and to do her the honour of turning the question over whether you mightn t one of these days have her in charge like Whether you mightn t be a sort of Miss Bella Wilfer to her and something more I should hope returned missus Lammle with a scornful look and in a loud voice that if I were anything to your wife sir I could hardly fail to be something more than Miss Bella Wilfer as you call her What do YOU call her ma am asked mister Boffin missus Lammle disdained to reply and sat defiantly beating one foot on the ground Again I think I may say that s not impossible Is it sir asked mister Boffin turning to Alfred It is not said Alfred smiling assent as before not impossible Now said mister Boffin gently it won t do I don t wish to say a single word that might be afterwards remembered as unpleasant but it won t do Sophronia my love her husband repeated in a bantering manner you hear It won t do No said mister Boffin with his voice still dropped it really won t You positively must excuse us If you ll go your way we ll go ours and so I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties missus Lammle gave him the look of a decidedly dissatisfied party demanding exemption from the category but said nothing The best thing we can make of the affair said mister Boffin is a matter of business and as a matter of business it s brought to a conclusion You have done me a great service a very great service and I have paid for it Is there any objection to the price mister and missus Lammle looked at one another across the table but neither could say that there was mister Lammle shrugged his shoulders and missus Lammle sat rigid Very good said mister Boffin We hope my old lady and me that you ll give us credit for taking the plainest and honestest short cut that could be taken under the circumstances We have talked it over with a deal of care my old lady and me and we have felt that at all to lead you on or even at all to let you go on of your own selves wouldn t be the right thing So I have openly given you to understand that mister Boffin sought for a new turn of speech but could find none so expressive as his former one repeated in a confidential tone that it won t do If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would but I hope I haven t put it very unpleasantly at all events I haven t meant to So said mister Boffin by way of peroration wishing you well in the way you go we now conclude with the observation that perhaps you ll go it mister Lammle rose with an impudent laugh on his side of the table and missus Lammle rose with a disdainful frown on hers At this moment a hasty foot was heard on the staircase and Georgiana Podsnap broke into the room unannounced and in tears Oh my dear Sophronia cried Georgiana wringing her hands as she ran up to embrace her to think that you and Alfred should be ruined Oh my poor dear Sophronia to think that you should have had a Sale at your house after all your kindness to me Oh mister and missus Boffin pray forgive me for this intrusion but you don t know how fond I was of Sophronia when Pa wouldn t let me go there any more or what I have felt for Sophronia since I heard from Ma of her having been brought low in the world You don t you can t you never can think how I have lain awake at night and cried for my good Sophronia my first and only friend missus Lammle s manner changed under the poor silly girl s embraces and she turned extremely pale directing one appealing look first to missus Boffin and then to mister Boffin Both understood her instantly with a more delicate subtlety than much better educated people whose perception came less directly from the heart could have brought to bear upon the case I haven t a minute said poor little Georgiana to stay I am out shopping early with Ma and I said I had a headache and got Ma to leave me outside in the phaeton in Piccadilly and ran round to Sackville Street and heard that Sophronia was here and then Ma came to see oh such a dreadful old stony woman from the country in a turban in Portland Place and I said I wouldn t go up with Ma but would drive round and leave cards for the Boffins which is taking a liberty with the name but oh my goodness I am distracted and the phaeton s at the door and what would Pa say if he knew it Don t ye be timid my dear said missus Boffin You came in to see us Oh no I didn t cried Georgiana It s very impolite I know but I came to see my poor Sophronia my only friend Oh how I felt the separation my dear Sophronia before I knew you were brought low in the world and how much more I feel it now There were actually tears in the bold woman s eyes as the soft headed and soft hearted girl twined her arms about her neck But I ve come on business said Georgiana sobbing and drying her face and then searching in a little reticule and if I don t despatch it I shall have come for nothing and oh good gracious what would Pa say if he knew of Sackville Street and what would Ma say if she was kept waiting on the doorsteps of that dreadful turban and there never were such pawing horses as ours unsettling my mind every moment more and more when I want more mind than I have got by pawing up mister Boffin s street where they have no business to be Oh where is where is it Oh I can t find it All this time sobbing and searching in the little reticule What do you miss my dear asked mister Boffin stepping forward Oh it s little enough replied Georgiana because Ma always treats me as if I was in the nursery I am sure I wish I was but I hardly ever spend it and it has mounted up to fifteen pounds Sophronia and I hope three five pound notes are better than nothing though so little so little And now I have found that oh my goodness there s the other gone next Oh no it isn t here it is With that always sobbing and searching in the reticule Georgiana produced a necklace Ma says chits and jewels have no business together pursued Georgiana and that s the reason why I have no trinkets except this but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion because she left me this though I used to think she might just as well have buried it for it s always kept in jewellers cotton However here it is I am thankful to say and of use at last and you ll sell it dear Sophronia and buy things with it Give it to me said mister Boffin gently taking it I ll see that it s properly disposed of Oh are you such a friend of Sophronia s mister Boffin cried Georgiana Oh how good of you Oh my gracious there was something else and it s gone out of my head Oh no it isn t I remember what it was My grandmamma s property that ll come to me when I am of age mister Boffin will be all my own and neither Pa nor Ma nor anybody else will have any control over it and what I wish to do it so make some of it over somehow to Sophronia and Alfred by signing something somewhere that ll prevail on somebody to advance them something I want them to have something handsome to bring them up in the world again Oh my goodness me Being such a friend of my dear Sophronia s you won t refuse me will you No no said mister Boffin it shall be seen to Oh thank you thank you cried Georgiana If my maid had a little note and half a crown I could run round to the pastrycook s to sign something or I could sign something in the Square if somebody would come and cough for me to let em in with the key and would bring a pen and ink with em and a bit of blotting paper Oh my gracious I must tear myself away or Pa and Ma will both find out Dear dear Sophronia good good bye The credulous little creature again embraced missus Lammle most affectionately and then held out her hand to mister Lammle Good bye dear mister Lammle I mean Alfred You won t think after to day that I have deserted you and Sophronia because you have been brought low in the world will you Oh me oh me I have been crying my eyes out of my head and Ma will be sure to ask me what s the matter Oh take me down somebody please please please mister Boffin took her down and saw her driven away with her poor little red eyes and weak chin peering over the great apron of the custard coloured phaeton as if she had been ordered to expiate some childish misdemeanour by going to bed in the daylight and were peeping over the counterpane in a miserable flutter of repentance and low spirits Returning to the breakfast room he found missus Lammle still standing on her side of the table and mister Lammle on his I ll take care said mister Boffin showing the money and the necklace that these are soon given back missus Lammle had taken up her parasol from a side table and stood sketching with it on the pattern of the damask cloth as she had sketched on the pattern of mister Twemlow s papered wall You will not undeceive her I hope mister Boffin she said turning her head towards him but not her eyes No said mister Boffin I mean as to the worth and value of her friend missus Lammle explained in a measured voice and with an emphasis on her last word No he returned I may try to give a hint at her home that she is in want of kind and careful protection but I shall say no more than that to her parents and I shall say nothing to the young lady herself mister and missus Boffin said missus Lammle still sketching and seeming to bestow great pains upon it there are not many people I think who under the circumstances would have been so considerate and sparing as you have been to me just now Do you care to be thanked Thanks are always worth having said missus Boffin in her ready good nature Then thank you both Sophronia asked her husband mockingly are you sentimental Well well my good sir mister Boffin interposed it s a very good thing to think well of another person and it s a very good thing to be thought well of BY another person missus Lammle will be none the worse for it if she is Much obliged But I asked missus Lammle if she was She stood sketching on the table cloth with her face clouded and set and was silent Because said Alfred I am disposed to be sentimental myself on your appropriation of the jewels and the money mister Boffin As our little Georgiana said three five pound notes are better than nothing and if you sell a necklace you can buy things with the produce IF you sell it was mister Boffin s comment as he put it in his pocket Alfred followed it with his looks and also greedily pursued the notes until they vanished into mister Boffin s waistcoat pocket Then he directed a look half exasperated and half jeering at his wife She still stood sketching but as she sketched there was a struggle within her which found expression in the depth of the few last lines the parasol point indented into the table cloth and then some tears fell from her eyes Why confound the woman exclaimed Lammle she IS sentimental She walked to the window flinching under his angry stare looked out for a moment and turned round quite coldly You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score Alfred and you will have none in future It is not worth your noticing We go abroad soon with the money we have earned here You know we do you know we must There is no fear of my taking any sentiment with me I should soon be eased of it if I did But it will be all left behind It IS all left behind Are you ready Alfred What the deuce have I been waiting for but you Sophronia Let us go then I am sorry I have delayed our dignified departure She passed out and he followed her mister and missus Boffin had the curiosity softly to raise a window and look after them as they went down the long street They walked arm in arm showily enough but without appearing to interchange a syllable It might have been fanciful to suppose that under their outer bearing there was something of the shamed air of two cheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs but not so to suppose that they were haggardly weary of one another of themselves and of all this world In turning the street corner they might have turned out of this world for anything mister and missus Boffin ever saw of them to the contrary for they set eyes on the Lammles never more Chapter three THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN SINKS AGAIN The evening of that day being one of the reading evenings at the Bower mister Boffin kissed missus Boffin after a five o clock dinner and trotted out nursing his big stick in both arms so that as of old it seemed to be whispering in his ear He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely mister Boffin s face was like the face of a thoughtful listener to an intricate communication and in trotting along he occasionally glanced at that companion with the look of a man who was interposing the remark You don t mean it mister Boffin and his stick went on alone together until they arrived at certain cross ways where they would be likely to fall in with any one coming at about the same time from Clerkenwell to the Bower Here they stopped and mister Boffin consulted his watch It wants five minutes good to Venus s appointment said he I m rather early But Venus was a punctual man and even as mister Boffin replaced his watch in its pocket was to be descried coming towards him He quickened his pace on seeing mister Boffin already at the place of meeting and was soon at his side Thank ee Venus said mister Boffin Thank ee thank ee thank ee It would not have been very evident why he thanked the anatomist but for his furnishing the explanation in what he went on to say All right Venus all right Now that you ve been to see me and have consented to keep up the appearance before Wegg of remaining in it for a time I have got a sort of a backer All right Venus Thank ee Venus Thank ee thank ee thank ee mister Venus shook the proffered hand with a modest air and they pursued the direction of the Bower Do you think Wegg is likely to drop down upon me to night Venus inquired mister Boffin wistfully as they went along I think he is sir Have you any particular reason for thinking so Venus Well sir returned that personage the fact is he has given me another look in to make sure of what he calls our stock in trade being correct and he has mentioned his intention that he was not to be put off beginning with you the very next time you should come And this hinted mister Venus delicately being the very next time you know sir Why therefore you suppose he ll turn to at the grindstone eh Wegg said mister Boffin Just so sir mister Boffin took his nose in his hand as if it were already excoriated and the sparks were beginning to fly out of that feature He s a terrible fellow Venus he s an awful fellow I don t know how ever I shall go through with it You must stand by me Venus like a good man and true You ll do all you can to stand by me Venus won t you mister Venus replied with the assurance that he would and mister Boffin looking anxious and dispirited pursued the way in silence until they rang at the Bower gate The stumping approach of Wegg was soon heard behind it and as it turned upon its hinges he became visible with his hand on the lock mister Boffin sir he remarked You re quite a stranger Yes I ve been otherwise occupied Wegg Have you indeed sir returned the literary gentleman with a threatening sneer Hah I ve been looking for you sir rather what I may call specially You don t say so Wegg Yes I do say so sir And if you hadn t come round to me tonight dash my wig if I wouldn t have come round to you tomorrow Now I tell you Nothing wrong I hope Wegg Oh no mister Boffin was the ironical answer Nothing wrong What should be wrong in Boffinses Bower Step in sir If you ll come to the Bower I ve shaded for you Your bed shan t be roses all spangled with doo Will you will you will you will you come to the Bower Oh won t you won t you won t you won t you come to the Bower An unholy glare of contradiction and offence shone in the eyes of mister Wegg as he turned the key on his patron after ushering him into the yard with this vocal quotation mister Boffin s air was crestfallen and submissive Whispered Wegg to Venus as they crossed the yard behind him Look at the worm and minion he s down in the mouth already Whispered Venus to Wegg That s because I ve told him I ve prepared the way for you mister Boffin entering the usual chamber laid his stick upon the settle usually reserved for him thrust his hands into his pockets and with his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them looking disconsolately at Wegg My friend and partner mister Venus gives me to understand remarked that man of might addressing him that you are aware of our power over you Now when you have took your hat off we ll go into that pint mister Boffin shook it off with one shake so that it dropped on the floor behind him and remained in his former attitude with his former rueful look upon him First of all I m a going to call you Boffin for short said Wegg If you don t like it it s open to you to lump it I don t mind it Wegg mister Boffin replied That s lucky for you Boffin Now do you want to be read to I don t particularly care about it to night Wegg Because if you did want to pursued mister Wegg the brilliancy of whose point was dimmed by his having been unexpectedly answered you wouldn t be I ve been your slave long enough I m not to be trampled under foot by a dustman any more With the single exception of the salary I renounce the whole and total sitiwation Since you say it is to be so Wegg returned mister Boffin with folded hands I suppose it must be I suppose it must be Wegg retorted Next to clear the ground before coming to business you ve placed in this yard a skulking a sneaking and a sniffing menial He hadn t a cold in his head when I sent him here said mister Boffin Boffin retorted Wegg I warn you not to attempt a joke with me Here mister Venus interposed and remarked that he conceived mister Boffin to have taken the description literally the rather forasmuch as he mister Venus had himself supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction or a habit of the nose involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of social intercourse until he had discovered that mister Wegg s description of him was to be accepted as merely figurative Anyhow and every how said Wegg he has been planted here and he is here Now I won t have him here So I call upon Boffin before I say another word to fetch him in and send him packing to the right about The unsuspecting Sloppy was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window mister Boffin after a short interval of impassive discomfiture opened the window and beckoned him to come in I call upon Boffin said Wegg with one arm a kimbo and his head on one side like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness to inform that menial that I am Master here In humble obedience when the button gleaming Sloppy entered mister Boffin said to him Sloppy my fine fellow mister Wegg is Master here He doesn t want you and you are to go from here For good mister Wegg severely stipulated For good said mister Boffin Sloppy stared with both his eyes and all his buttons and his mouth wide open but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders and locked out The atomspear said Wegg stumping back into the room again a little reddened by his late exertion is now freer for the purposes of respiration mister Venus sir take a chair Boffin you may sit down mister Boffin still with his hands ruefully stuck in his pockets sat on the edge of the settle shrunk into a small compass and eyed the potent Silas with conciliatory looks This gentleman said Silas Wegg pointing out Venus this gentleman Boffin is more milk and watery with you than I ll be But he hasn t borne the Roman yoke as I have nor yet he hasn t been required to pander to your depraved appetite for miserly characters I never meant my dear Wegg mister Boffin was beginning when Silas stopped him Hold your tongue Boffin Answer when you re called upon to answer You ll find you ve got quite enough to do Now you re aware are you that you re in possession of property to which you ve no right at all Are you aware of that Venus tells me so said mister Boffin glancing towards him for any support he could give I tell you so returned Silas Now here s my hat Boffin and here s my walking stick Trifle with me and instead of making a bargain with you I ll put on my hat and take up my walking stick and go out and make a bargain with the rightful owner Now what do you say I say returned mister Boffin leaning forward in alarmed appeal with his hands on his knees that I am sure I don t want to trifle Wegg I have said so to Venus You certainly have sir said Venus You re too milk and watery with our friend you are indeed remonstrated Silas with a disapproving shake of his wooden head Then at once you confess yourself desirous to come to terms do you Boffin Before you answer keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking stick I am willing Wegg to come to terms Willing won t do Boffin I won t take willing Are you desirous to come to terms Do you ask to be allowed as a favour to come to terms mister Wegg again planted his arm and put his head on one side Yes Yes what said the inexorable Wegg I won t take yes I ll have it out of you in full Boffin Dear me cried that unfortunate gentleman I am so worrited I ask to be allowed to come to terms supposing your document is all correct Don t you be afraid of that said Silas poking his head at him You shall be satisfied by seeing it mister Venus will show it you and I ll hold you the while Then you want to know what the terms are Is that about the sum and substance of it Will you or won t you answer Boffin For he had paused a moment Dear me cried that unfortunate gentleman again I am worrited to that degree that I m almost off my head You hurry me so Be so good as name the terms Wegg Now mark Boffin returned Silas Mark em well because they re the lowest terms and the only terms You ll throw your Mound the little Mound as comes to you any way into the general estate and then you ll divide the whole property into three parts and you ll keep one and hand over the others mister Venus s mouth screwed itself up as mister Boffin s face lengthened itself mister Venus not having been prepared for such a rapacious demand Now wait a bit Boffin Wegg proceeded there s something more You ve been a squandering this property laying some of it out on yourself THAT won t do You ve bought a house You ll be charged for it I shall be ruined Wegg mister Boffin faintly protested Now wait a bit Boffin there s something more You ll leave me in sole custody of these Mounds till they re all laid low If any waluables should be found in em I ll take care of such waluables You ll produce your contract for the sale of the Mounds that we may know to a penny what they re worth and you ll make out likewise an exact list of all the other property When the Mounds is cleared away to the last shovel full the final diwision will come off Dreadful dreadful dreadful I shall die in a workhouse cried the Golden Dustman with his hands to his head Now wait a bit Boffin there s something more You ve been unlawfully ferreting about this yard You ve been seen in the act of ferreting about this yard Two pair of eyes at the present moment brought to bear upon you have seen you dig up a Dutch bottle It was mine Wegg protested mister Boffin I put it there myself What was in it Boffin inquired Silas Not gold not silver not bank notes not jewels nothing that you could turn into money Wegg upon my soul Prepared mister Venus said Wegg turning to his partner with a knowing and superior air for an ewasive answer on the part of our dusty friend here I have hit out a little idea which I think will meet your views We charge that bottle against our dusty friend at a thousand pound mister Boffin drew a deep groan Now wait a bit Boffin there s something more In your employment is an under handed sneak named Rokesmith It won t answer to have HIM about while this business of ours is about He must be discharged Rokesmith is already discharged said mister Boffin speaking in a muffled voice with his hands before his face as he rocked himself on the settle Already discharged is he returned Wegg surprised Oh Then Boffin I believe there s nothing more at present The unlucky gentleman continuing to rock himself to and fro and to utter an occasional moan mister Venus besought him to bear up against his reverses and to take time to accustom himself to the thought of his new position But his taking time was exactly the thing of all others that Silas Wegg could not be induced to hear of Yes or no and no half measures was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated shaking his fist at mister Boffin and pegging his motto into the floor with his wooden leg in a threatening and alarming manner At length mister Boffin entreated to be allowed a quarter of an hour s grace and a cooling walk of that duration in the yard With some difficulty mister Wegg granted this great favour but only on condition that he accompanied mister Boffin in his walk as not knowing what he might fraudulently unearth if he were left to himself A more absurd sight than mister Boffin in his mental irritation trotting very nimbly and mister Wegg hopping after him with great exertion eager to watch the slightest turn of an eyelash lest it should indicate a spot rich with some secret assuredly had never been seen in the shadow of the Mounds mister Wegg was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired and came hopping in a very bad second I can t help myself cried mister Boffin flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner with his hands deep in his pockets as if his pockets had sunk What s the good of my pretending to stand out when I can t help myself I must give in to the terms But I should like to see the document Wegg who was all for clinching the nail he had so strongly driven home announced that Boffin should see it without an hour s delay Taking him into custody for that purpose or overshadowing him as if he really were his Evil Genius in visible form mister Wegg clapped mister Boffin s hat upon the back of his head and walked him out by the arm asserting a proprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in mister Venus s rare collection That light haired gentleman followed close upon their heels at least backing up mister Boffin in a literal sense if he had not had recent opportunities of doing so spiritually while mister Boffin trotting on as hard as he could trot involved Silas Wegg in frequent collisions with the public much as a pre occupied blind man s dog may be seen to involve his master Thus they reached mister Venus s establishment somewhat heated by the nature of their progress thither mister Wegg especially was in a flaming glow and stood in the little shop panting and mopping his head with his pocket handkerchief speechless for several minutes Meanwhile mister Venus who had left the duelling frogs to fight it out in his absence by candlelight for the public delectation put the shutters up When all was snug and the shop door fastened he said to the perspiring Silas I suppose mister Wegg we may now produce the paper Hold on a minute sir replied that discreet character hold on a minute Will you obligingly shove that box which you mentioned on a former occasion as containing miscellanies towards me in the midst of the shop here mister Venus did as he was asked Very good said Silas looking about ve ry good Will you hand me that chair sir to put a top of it Venus handed him the chair Now Boffin said Wegg mount up here and take your seat will you mister Boffin as if he were about to have his portrait painted or to be electrified or to be made a Freemason or to be placed at any other solitary disadvantage ascended the rostrum prepared for him Now mister Venus said Silas taking off his coat when I catches our friend here round the arms and body and pins him tight to the back of the chair you may show him what he wants to see If you ll open it and hold it well up in one hand sir and a candle in the other he can read it charming mister Boffin seemed rather inclined to object to these precautionary arrangements but being immediately embraced by Wegg resigned himself Venus then produced the document and mister Boffin slowly spelt it out aloud so very slowly that Wegg who was holding him in the chair with the grip of a wrestler became again exceedingly the worse for his exertions Say when you ve put it safe back mister Venus he uttered with difficulty for the strain of this is terrimenjious At length the document was restored to its place and Wegg whose uncomfortable attitude had been that of a very persevering man unsuccessfully attempting to stand upon his head took a seat to recover himself mister Boffin for his part made no attempt to come down but remained aloft disconsolate Well Boffin said Wegg as soon as he was in a condition to speak Now you know Yes Wegg said mister Boffin meekly Now I know You have no doubts about it Boffin No Wegg No Wegg None was the slow and sad reply Then take care you said Wegg that you stick to your conditions mister Venus if on this auspicious occasion you should happen to have a drop of anything not quite so mild as tea in the ouse I think I d take the friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it mister Venus reminded of the duties of hospitality produced some rum In answer to the inquiry Will you mix it mister Wegg that gentleman pleasantly rejoined I think not sir On so auspicious an occasion I prefer to take it in the form of a Gum Tickler mister Boffin declining rum being still elevated on his pedestal was in a convenient position to be addressed Wegg having eyed him with an impudent air at leisure addressed him therefore while refreshing himself with his dram Bof fin Yes Wegg he answered coming out of a fit of abstraction with a sigh I haven t mentioned one thing because it s a detail that comes of course You must be followed up you know You must be kept under inspection I don t quite understand said mister Boffin Don t you sneered Wegg Where s your wits Boffin Till the Mounds is down and this business completed you re accountable for all the property recollect Consider yourself accountable to me mister Venus here being too milk and watery with you I am the boy for you I ve been a thinking said mister Boffin in a tone of despondency that I must keep the knowledge from my old lady The knowledge of the diwision d ye mean inquired Wegg helping himself to a third Gum Tickler for he had already taken a second Yes If she was to die first of us two she might then think all her life poor thing that I had got the rest of the fortune still and was saving it I suspect Boffin returned Wegg shaking his head sagaciously and bestowing a wooden wink upon him that you ve found out some account of some old chap supposed to be a Miser who got himself the credit of having much more money than he had However I don t mind Don t you see Wegg mister Boffin feelingly represented to him don t you see My old lady has got so used to the property It would be such a hard surprise I don t see it at all blustered Wegg You ll have as much as I shall And who are you But then again mister Boffin gently represented my old lady has very upright principles Who s your old lady returned Wegg to set herself up for having uprighter principles than mine mister Boffin seemed a little less patient at this point than at any other of the negotiations But he commanded himself and said tamely enough I think it must be kept from my old lady Wegg Well said Wegg contemptuously though perhaps perceiving some hint of danger otherwise keep it from your old lady I ain t going to tell her I can have you under close inspection without that I m as good a man as you and better Ask me to dinner Give me the run of your ouse I was good enough for you and your old lady once when I helped you out with your weal and hammers Was there no Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane and Uncle Parker before YOU two Gently mister Wegg gently Venus urged Milk and water erily you mean sir he returned with some little thickness of speech in consequence of the Gum Ticklers having tickled it I ve got him under inspection and I ll inspect him Along the line the signal ran England expects as this present man Will keep Boffin to his duty Boffin I ll see you home mister Boffin descended with an air of resignation and gave himself up after taking friendly leave of mister Venus Once more Inspector and Inspected went through the streets together and so arrived at mister Boffin s door But even there when mister Boffin had given his keeper good night and had let himself in with his key and had softly closed the door even there and then the all powerful Silas must needs claim another assertion of his newly asserted power Bof fin he called through the keyhole Yes Wegg was the reply through the same channel Come out Show yourself again Let s have another look at you mister Boffin ah how fallen from the high estate of his honest simplicity opened the door and obeyed Go in You may get to bed now said Wegg with a grin The door was hardly closed when he again called through the keyhole Bof fin Yes Wegg This time Silas made no reply but laboured with a will at turning an imaginary grindstone outside the keyhole while mister Boffin stooped at it within he then laughed silently and stumped home Chapter four A RUNAWAY MATCH Cherubic Pa arose with as little noise as possible from beside majestic Ma one morning early having a holiday before him Pa and the lovely woman had a rather particular appointment to keep Yet Pa and the lovely woman were not going out together Bella was up before four but had no bonnet on She was waiting at the foot of the stairs was sitting on the bottom stair in fact to receive Pa when he came down but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the house Your breakfast is ready sir whispered Bella after greeting him with a hug and all you have to do is to eat it up and drink it up and escape How do you feel Pa To the best of my judgement like a housebreaker new to the business my dear who can t make himself quite comfortable till he is off the premises Bella tucked her arm in his with a merry noiseless laugh and they went down to the kitchen on tiptoe she stopping on every separate stair to put the tip of her forefinger on her rosy lips and then lay it on his lips according to her favourite petting way of kissing Pa How do YOU feel my love asked R W as she gave him his breakfast I feel as if the Fortune teller was coming true dear Pa and the fair little man was turning out as was predicted Ho Only the fair little man said her father Bella put another of those finger seals upon his lips and then said kneeling down by him as he sat at table Now look here sir If you keep well up to the mark this day what do you think you deserve What did I promise you should have if you were good upon a certain occasion Upon my word I don t remember Precious Yes I do though Wasn t it one of these beau tiful tresses with his caressing hand upon her hair Wasn t it too returned Bella pretending to pout Upon my word Do you know sir that the Fortune teller would give five thousand guineas if it was quite convenient to him which it isn t for the lovely piece I have cut off for you You can form no idea sir of the number of times he kissed quite a scrubby little piece in comparison that I cut off for HIM And he wears it too round his neck I can tell you Near his heart said Bella nodding Ah very near his heart However you have been a good good boy and you are the best of all the dearest boys that ever were this morning and here s the chain I have made of it Pa and you must let me put it round your neck with my own loving hands As Pa bent his head she cried over him a little and then said after having stopped to dry her eyes on his white waistcoat the discovery of which incongruous circumstance made her laugh Now darling Pa give me your hands that I may fold them together and do you say after me My little Bella My little Bella repeated Pa I am very fond of you I am very fond of you my darling said Pa You mustn t say anything not dictated to you sir You daren t do it in your responses at Church and you mustn t do it in your responses out of Church I withdraw the darling said Pa That s a pious boy Now again You were always You were always repeated Pa A vexatious No you weren t said Pa A vexatious do you hear sir a vexatious capricious thankless troublesome Animal but I hope you ll do better in the time to come and I bless you and forgive you Here she quite forgot that it was Pa s turn to make the responses and clung to his neck Dear Pa if you knew how much I think this morning of what you told me once about the first time of our seeing old mister Harmon when I stamped and screamed and beat you with my detestable little bonnet I feel as if I had been stamping and screaming and beating you with my hateful little bonnet ever since I was born darling Nonsense my love And as to your bonnets they have always been nice bonnets for they have always become you or you have become them perhaps it was that at every age Did I hurt you much poor little Pa asked Bella laughing notwithstanding her repentance with fantastic pleasure in the picture when I beat you with my bonnet No my child Wouldn t have hurt a fly Ay but I am afraid I shouldn t have beat you at all unless I had meant to hurt you said Bella Did I pinch your legs Pa Not much my dear but I think it s almost time I Oh yes cried Bella If I go on chattering you ll be taken alive Fly Pa fly So they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe and Bella with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door and Pa having received a parting hug made off When he had gone a little way he looked back Upon which Bella set another of those finger seals upon the air and thrust out her little foot expressive of the mark Pa in appropriate action expressed fidelity to the mark and made off as fast as he could go Bella walked thoughtfully in the garden for an hour and more and then returning to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered put on a little bonnet of quiet but on the whole of sly appearance which she had yesterday made I am going for a walk Lavvy she said as she stooped down and kissed her The Irrepressible with a bounce in the bed and a remark that it wasn t time to get up yet relapsed into unconsciousness if she had come out of it Behold Bella tripping along the streets the dearest girl afoot under the summer sun Behold Pa waiting for Bella behind a pump at least three miles from the parental roof tree Behold Bella and Pa aboard an early steamboat for Greenwich Were they expected at Greenwich Probably At least mister John Rokesmith was on the pier looking out about a couple of hours before the coaly but to him gold dusty little steamboat got her steam up in London Probably At least mister John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board Probably At least Bella no sooner stepped ashore than she took mister John Rokesmith s arm without evincing surprise and the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness which as it were wafted up from the earth and drew after them a gruff and glum old pensioner to see it out Two wooden legs had this gruff and glum old pensioner and a minute before Bella stepped out of the boat and drew that confiding little arm of hers through Rokesmith s he had had no object in life but tobacco and not enough of that Stranded was Gruff and Glum in a harbour of everlasting mud when all in an instant Bella floated him and away he went Say cherubic parent taking the lead in what direction do we steer first With some such inquiry in his thoughts Gruff and Glum stricken by so sudden an interest that he perked his neck and looked over the intervening people as if he were trying to stand on tiptoe with his two wooden legs took an observation of R W There was no first in the case Gruff and Glum made out the cherubic parent was bearing down and crowding on direct for Greenwich church to see his relations For Gruff and Glum though most events acted on him simply as tobacco stoppers pressing down and condensing the quids within him might be imagined to trace a family resemblance between the cherubs in the church architecture and the cherub in the white waistcoat Some remembrance of old Valentines wherein a cherub less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate had been seen conducting lovers to the altar might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of his timber toes Be it as it might he gave his moorings the slip and followed in chase The cherub went before all beaming smiles Bella and John Rokesmith followed Gruff and Glum stuck to them like wax For years the wings of his mind had gone to look after the legs of his body but Bella had brought them back for him per steamer and they were spread again He was a slow sailer on a wind of happiness but he took a cross cut for the rendezvous and pegged away as if he were scoring furiously at cribbage When the shadow of the church porch swallowed them up victorious Gruff and Glum likewise presented himself to be swallowed up And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise that but for the two wooden legs on which Gruff and Glum was reassuringly mounted his conscience might have introduced in the person of that pensioner his own stately lady disguised arrived at Greenwich in a car and griffins like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the Princesses to do something dreadful to the marriage service And truly he had a momentary reason to be pale of face and to whisper to Bella You don t think that can be your Ma do you my dear on account of a mysterious rustling and a stealthy movement somewhere in the remote neighbourhood of the organ though it was gone directly and was heard no more Albeit it was heard of afterwards as will afterwards be read in this veracious register of marriage Who taketh I John and so do I Bella Who giveth I R W Forasmuch Gruff and Glum as John and Bella have consented together in holy wedlock you may in short consider it done and withdraw your two wooden legs from this temple To the foregoing purport the Minister speaking as directed by the Rubric to the People selectly represented in the present instance by G and G above mentioned And now the church porch having swallowed up Bella Wilfer for ever and ever had it not in its power to relinquish that young woman but slid into the happy sunlight missus John Rokesmith instead And long on the bright steps stood Gruff and Glum looking after the pretty bride with a narcotic consciousness of having dreamed a dream After which Bella took out from her pocket a little letter and read it aloud to Pa and John this being a true copy of the same DEAREST MA I hope you won t be angry but I am most happily married to mister John Rokesmith who loves me better than I can ever deserve except by loving him with all my heart I thought it best not to mention it beforehand in case it should cause any little difference at home Please tell darling Pa With love to Lavvy Ever dearest Ma Your affectionate daughter BELLA P S Rokesmith Then John Rokesmith put the queen s countenance on the letter when had Her Gracious Majesty looked so benign as on that blessed morning and then Bella popped it into the post office and said merrily Now dearest Pa you are safe and will never be taken alive Pa was at first in the stirred depths of his conscience so far from sure of being safe yet that he made out majestic matrons lurking in ambush among the harmless trees of Greenwich Park and seemed to see a stately countenance tied up in a well known pocket handkerchief glooming down at him from a window of the Observatory where the Familiars of the Astronomer Royal nightly outwatch the winking stars But the minutes passing on and no missus Wilfer in the flesh appearing he became more confident and so repaired with good heart and appetite to mister and missus John Rokesmith s cottage on Blackheath where breakfast was ready A modest little cottage but a bright and a fresh and on the snowy tablecloth the prettiest of little breakfasts In waiting too like an attendant summer breeze a fluttering young damsel all pink and ribbons blushing as if she had been married instead of Bella and yet asserting the triumph of her sex over both John and Pa in an exulting and exalted flurry as who should say This is what you must all come to gentlemen when we choose to bring you to book This same young damsel was Bella s serving maid and unto her did deliver a bunch of keys commanding treasures in the way of dry saltery groceries jams and pickles the investigation of which made pastime after breakfast when Bella declared that Pa must taste everything John dear or it will never be lucky and when Pa had all sorts of things poked into his mouth and didn t quite know what to do with them when they were put there Then they all three out for a charming ride and for a charming stroll among heath in bloom and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with his wooden legs horizontally disposed before him apparently sitting meditating on the vicissitudes of life To whom said Bella in her light hearted surprise Oh How do you do again What a dear old pensioner you are To which Gruff and Glum responded that he see her married this morning my Beauty and that if it warn t a liberty he wished her ji and the fairest of fair wind and weather further in a general way requesting to know what cheer and scrambling up on his two wooden legs to salute hat in hand ship shape with the gallantry of a man of warsman and a heart of oak It was a pleasant sight in the midst of the golden bloom to see this salt old Gruff and Glum waving his shovel hat at Bella while his thin white hair flowed free as if she had once more launched him into blue water again You are a charming old pensioner said Bella and I am so happy that I wish I could make you happy too Answered Gruff and Glum Give me leave to kiss your hand my Lovely and it s done So it was done to the general contentment and if Gruff and Glum didn t in the course of the afternoon splice the main brace it was not for want of the means of inflicting that outrage on the feelings of the Infant Bands of Hope But the marriage dinner was the crowning success for what had bride and bridegroom plotted to do but to have and to hold that dinner in the very room of the very hotel where Pa and the lovely woman had once dined together Bella sat between Pa and John and divided her attentions pretty equally but felt it necessary in the waiter s absence before dinner to remind Pa that she was HIS lovely woman no longer I am well aware of it my dear returned the cherub and I resign you willingly Willingly sir You ought to be brokenhearted So I should be my dear if I thought that I was going to lose you But you know you are not don t you poor dear Pa You know that you have only made a new relation who will be as fond of you and as thankful to you for my sake and your own sake both as I am don t you dear little Pa Look here Pa Bella put her finger on her own lip and then on Pa s and then on her own lip again and then on her husband s Now we are a partnership of three dear Pa The appearance of dinner here cut Bella short in one of her disappearances the more effectually because it was put on under the auspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat who looked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman and seemed to have mounted a great deal higher in the church not to say scaled the steeple This dignitary conferring in secrecy with John Rokesmith on the subject of punch and wines bent his head as though stooping to the Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession Likewise on John s offering a suggestion which didn t meet his views his face became overcast and reproachful as enjoining penance What a dinner Specimens of all the fishes that swim in the sea surely had swum their way to it and if samples of the fishes of divers colours that made a speech in the Arabian Nights quite a ministerial explanation in respect of cloudiness and then jumped out of the frying pan were not to be recognized it was only because they had all become of one hue by being cooked in batter among the whitebait And the dishes being seasoned with Bliss an article which they are sometimes out of at Greenwich were of perfect flavour and the golden drinks had been bottled in the golden age and hoarding up their sparkles ever since The best of it was that Bella and John and the cherub had made a covenant that they would not reveal to mortal eyes any appearance whatever of being a wedding party Now the supervising dignitary the Archbishop of Greenwich knew this as well as if he had performed the nuptial ceremony And the loftiness with which his Grace entered into their confidence without being invited and insisted on a show of keeping the waiters out of it was the crowning glory of the entertainment There was an innocent young waiter of a slender form and with weakish legs as yet unversed in the wiles of waiterhood and but too evidently of a romantic temperament and deeply it were not too much to add hopelessly in love with some young female not aware of his merit This guileless youth descrying the position of affairs which even his innocence could not mistake limited his waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when Bella didn t want anything and swooping at her when she did Him his Grace the Archbishop perpetually obstructed cutting him out with his elbow in the moment of success despatching him in degrading quest of melted butter and when by any chance he got hold of any dish worth having bereaving him of it and ordering him to stand back Pray excuse him madam said the Archbishop in a low stately voice he is a very young man on liking and we DON T like him This induced John Rokesmith to observe by way of making the thing more natural Bella my love this is so much more successful than any of our past anniversaries that I think we must keep our future anniversaries here Whereunto Bella replied with probably the least successful attempt at looking matronly that ever was seen Indeed I think so John dear Here the Archbishop of Greenwich coughed a stately cough to attract the attention of three of his ministers present and staring at them seemed to say I call upon you by your fealty to believe this With his own hands he afterwards put on the dessert as remarking to the three guests The period has now arrived at which we can dispense with the assistance of those fellows who are not in our confidence and would have retired with complete dignity but for a daring action issuing from the misguided brain of the young man on liking He finding by ill fortune a piece of orange flower somewhere in the lobbies now approached undetected with the same in a finger glass and placed it on Bella s right hand The Archbishop instantly ejected and excommunicated him but the thing was done I trust madam said his Grace returning alone that you will have the kindness to overlook it in consideration of its being the act of a very young man who is merely here on liking and who will never answer With that he solemnly bowed and retired and they all burst into laughter long and merry Disguise is of no use said Bella they all find me out I think it must be Pa and John dear because I look so happy Her husband feeling it necessary at this point to demand one of those mysterious disappearances on Bella s part she dutifully obeyed saying in a softened voice from her place of concealment You remember how we talked about the ships that day Pa Yes my dear Isn t it strange now to think that there was no John in all the ships Pa Not at all my dear Oh Pa Not at all No my dear How can we tell what coming people are aboard the ships that may be sailing to us now from the unknown seas Bella remaining invisible and silent her father remained at his dessert and wine until he remembered it was time for him to get home to Holloway Though I positively cannot tear myself away he cherubically added it would be a sin without drinking to many many happy returns of this most happy day Here ten thousand times cried John I fill my glass and my precious wife s Gentlemen said the cherub inaudibly addressing in his Anglo Saxon tendency to throw his feelings into the form of a speech the boys down below who were bidding against each other to put their heads in the mud for sixpence Gentlemen and Bella and John you will readily suppose that it is not my intention to trouble you with many observations on the present occasion You will also at once infer the nature and even the terms of the toast I am about to propose on the present occasion Gentlemen and Bella and John the present occasion is an occasion fraught with feelings that I cannot trust myself to express But gentlemen and Bella and John for the part I have had in it for the confidence you have placed in me and for the affectionate good nature and kindness with which you have determined not to find me in the way when I am well aware that I cannot be otherwise than in it more or less I do most heartily thank you Gentlemen and Bella and John my love to you and may we meet as on the present occasion on many future occasions that is to say gentlemen and Bella and John on many happy returns of the present happy occasion Having thus concluded his address the amiable cherub embraced his daughter and took his flight to the steamboat which was to convey him to London and was then lying at the floating pier doing its best to bump the same to bits But the happy couple were not going to part with him in that way and before he had been on board two minutes there they were looking down at him from the wharf above Pa dear cried Bella beckoning him with her parasol to approach the side and bending gracefully to whisper Yes my darling Did I beat you much with that horrid little bonnet Pa Nothing to speak of my dear Did I pinch your legs Pa Only nicely my pet You are sure you quite forgive me Pa Please Pa please forgive me quite Half laughing at him and half crying to him Bella besought him in the prettiest manner in a manner so engaging and so playful and so natural that her cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if she had never grown up and said What a silly little Mouse it is But you do forgive me that and everything else don t you Pa Yes my dearest And you don t feel solitary or neglected going away by yourself do you Pa Lord bless you No my Life Good bye dearest Pa Good bye Good bye my darling Take her away my dear John Take her home So she leaning on her husband s arm they turned homeward by a rosy path which the gracious sun struck out for them in its setting And O there are days in this life worth life and worth death And O what a bright old song it is that O tis love tis love tis love that makes the world go round Chapter five CONCERNING THE MENDICANT S BRIDE The impressive gloom with which missus Wilfer received her husband on his return from the wedding knocked so hard at the door of the cherubic conscience and likewise so impaired the firmness of the cherubic legs that the culprit s tottering condition of mind and body might have roused suspicion in less occupied persons that the grimly heroic lady Miss Lavinia and that esteemed friend of the family mister George Sampson But the attention of all three being fully possessed by the main fact of the marriage they had happily none to bestow on the guilty conspirator to which fortunate circumstance he owed the escape for which he was in nowise indebted to himself You do not R W said missus Wilfer from her stately corner inquire for your daughter Bella To be sure my dear he returned with a most flagrant assumption of unconsciousness I did omit it How or perhaps I should rather say where IS Bella Not here missus Wilfer proclaimed with folded arms The cherub faintly muttered something to the abortive effect of Oh indeed my dear Not here repeated missus Wilfer in a stern sonorous voice In a word R W you have no daughter Bella No daughter Bella my dear No Your daughter Bella said missus Wilfer with a lofty air of never having had the least copartnership in that young lady of whom she now made reproachful mention as an article of luxury which her husband had set up entirely on his own account and in direct opposition to her advice your daughter Bella has bestowed herself upon a Mendicant Good gracious my dear Show your father his daughter Bella s letter Lavinia said missus Wilfer in her monotonous Act of Parliament tone and waving her hand I think your father will admit it to be documentary proof of what I tell him I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter Bella s writing But I do not know He may tell you he is not Nothing will surprise me Posted at Greenwich and dated this morning said the Irrepressible flouncing at her father in handing him the evidence Hopes Ma won t be angry but is happily married to mister John Rokesmith and didn t mention it beforehand to avoid words and please tell darling you and love to me and I should like to know what you d have said if any other unmarried member of the family had done it He read the letter and faintly exclaimed Dear me You may well say Dear me rejoined missus Wilfer in a deep tone Upon which encouragement he said it again though scarcely with the success he had expected for the scornful lady then remarked with extreme bitterness You said that before It s very surprising But I suppose my dear hinted the cherub as he folded the letter after a disconcerting silence that we must make the best of it Would you object to my pointing out my dear that mister John Rokesmith is not so far as I am acquainted with him strictly speaking a Mendicant Indeed returned missus Wilfer with an awful air of politeness Truly so I was not aware that mister John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property But I am much relieved to hear it I doubt if you HAVE heard it my dear the cherub submitted with hesitation Thank you said missus Wilfer I make false statements it appears So be it If my daughter flies in my face surely my husband may The one thing is not more unnatural than the other There seems a fitness in the arrangement By all means Assuming with a shiver of resignation a deadly cheerfulness But here the Irrepressible skirmished into the conflict dragging the reluctant form of mister Sampson after her Ma interposed the young lady I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point and not hold forth about people s flying into people s faces which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense How exclaimed missus Wilfer knitting her dark brows Just im possible nonsense Ma returned Lavvy and George Sampson knows it is as well as I do missus Wilfer suddenly becoming petrified fixed her indignant eyes upon the wretched George who divided between the support due from him to his love and the support due from him to his love s mamma supported nobody not even himself The true point is pursued Lavinia that Bella has behaved in a most unsisterly way to me and might have severely compromised me with George and with George s family by making off and getting married in this very low and disreputable manner with some pew opener or other I suppose for a bridesmaid when she ought to have confided in me and ought to have said If Lavvy you consider it due to your engagement with George that you should countenance the occasion by being present then Lavvy I beg you to BE present keeping my secret from Ma and Pa As of course I should have done As of course you would have done Ingrate exclaimed missus Wilfer Viper I say You know ma am Upon my honour you mustn t mister Sampson remonstrated shaking his head seriously With the highest respect for you ma am upon my life you mustn t No really you know When a man with the feelings of a gentleman finds himself engaged to a young lady and it comes even on the part of a member of the family to vipers you know I would merely put it to your own good feeling you know said mister Sampson in rather lame conclusion missus Wilfer s baleful stare at the young gentleman in acknowledgment of his obliging interference was of such a nature that Miss Lavinia burst into tears and caught him round the neck for his protection My own unnatural mother screamed the young lady wants to annihilate George But you shan t be annihilated George I ll die first mister Sampson in the arms of his mistress still struggled to shake his head at missus Wilfer and to remark With every sentiment of respect for you you know ma am vipers really doesn t do you credit You shall not be annihilated George cried Miss Lavinia Ma shall destroy me first and then she ll be contented Oh oh oh Have I lured George from his happy home to expose him to this George dear be free Leave me ever dearest George to Ma and to my fate Give my love to your aunt George dear and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence Oh oh oh The young lady who hysterically speaking was only just come of age and had never gone off yet here fell into a highly creditable crisis which regarded as a first performance was very successful mister Sampson bending over the body meanwhile in a state of distraction which induced him to address missus Wilfer in the inconsistent expressions Demon with the highest respect for you behold your work The cherub stood helplessly rubbing his chin and looking on but on the whole was inclined to welcome this diversion as one in which by reason of the absorbent properties of hysterics the previous question would become absorbed And so indeed it proved for the Irrepressible gradually coming to herself and asking with wild emotion George dear are you safe and further George love what has happened Where is Ma mister Sampson with words of comfort raised her prostrate form and handed her to missus Wilfer as if the young lady were something in the nature of refreshments missus Wilfer with dignity partaking of the refreshments by kissing her once on the brow as if accepting an oyster Miss Lavvy tottering returned to the protection of mister Sampson to whom she said George dear I am afraid I have been foolish but I am still a little weak and giddy don t let go my hand George And whom she afterwards greatly agitated at intervals by giving utterance when least expected to a sound between a sob and a bottle of soda water that seemed to rend the bosom of her frock Among the most remarkable effects of this crisis may be mentioned its having when peace was restored an inexplicable moral influence of an elevating kind on Miss Lavinia missus Wilfer and mister George Sampson from which R W was altogether excluded as an outsider and non sympathizer Miss Lavinia assumed a modest air of having distinguished herself missus Wilfer a serene air of forgiveness and resignation mister Sampson an air of having been improved and chastened The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question George dear said Lavvy with a melancholy smile after what has passed I am sure Ma will tell Pa that he may tell Bella we shall all be glad to see her and her husband mister Sampson said he was sure of it too murmuring how eminently he respected missus Wilfer and ever must and ever would Never more eminently he added than after what had passed Far be it from me said missus Wilfer making deep proclamation from her corner to run counter to the feelings of a child of mine and of a Youth mister Sampson hardly seemed to like that word who is the object of her maiden preference I may feel nay know that I have been deluded and deceived I may feel nay know that I have been set aside and passed over I may feel nay know that after having so far overcome my repugnance towards mister and missus Boffin as to receive them under this roof and to consent to your daughter Bella s here turning to her husband residing under theirs it were well if your daughter Bella again turning to her husband had profited in a worldly point of view by a connection so distasteful so disreputable I may feel nay know that in uniting herself to mister Rokesmith she has united herself to one who is in spite of shallow sophistry a Mendicant And I may feel well assured that your daughter Bella again turning to her husband does not exalt her family by becoming a Mendicant s bride But I suppress what I feel and say nothing of it mister Sampson murmured that this was the sort of thing you might expect from one who had ever in her own family been an example and never an outrage And ever more so mister Sampson added with some degree of obscurity and never more so than in and through what had passed He must take the liberty of adding that what was true of the mother was true of the youngest daughter and that he could never forget the touching feelings that the conduct of both had awakened within him In conclusion he did hope that there wasn t a man with a beating heart who was capable of something that remained undescribed in consequence of Miss Lavinia s stopping him as he reeled in his speech Therefore R W said missus Wilfer resuming her discourse and turning to her lord again let your daughter Bella come when she will and she will be received So after a short pause and an air of having taken medicine in it so will her husband And I beg Pa said Lavinia that you will not tell Bella what I have undergone It can do no good and it might cause her to reproach herself My dearest girl urged mister Sampson she ought to know it No George said Lavinia in a tone of resolute self denial No dearest George let it be buried in oblivion mister Sampson considered that too noble Nothing is too noble dearest George returned Lavinia And Pa I hope you will be careful not to refer before Bella if you can help it to my engagement to George It might seem like reminding her of her having cast herself away And I hope Pa that you will think it equally right to avoid mentioning George s rising prospects when Bella is present It might seem like taunting her with her own poor fortunes Let me ever remember that I am her younger sister and ever spare her painful contrasts which could not but wound her sharply mister Sampson expressed his belief that such was the demeanour of Angels Miss Lavvy replied with solemnity No dearest George I am but too well aware that I am merely human missus Wilfer for her part still further improved the occasion by sitting with her eyes fastened on her husband like two great black notes of interrogation severely inquiring Are you looking into your breast Do you deserve your blessings Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter I do not ask you if you are worthy of such a wife put Me out of the question but are you sufficiently conscious of and thankful for the pervading moral grandeur of the family spectacle on which you are gazing These inquiries proved very harassing to R W who besides being a little disturbed by wine was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge However the scene being over and all things considered well over he sought refuge in a doze which gave his lady immense offence Can you think of your daughter Bella and sleep she disdainfully inquired To which he mildly answered Yes I think I can my dear Then said missus Wilfer with solemn indignation I would recommend you if you have a human feeling to retire to bed Thank you my dear he replied I think it IS the best place for me And with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew Within a few weeks afterwards the Mendicant s bride arm in arm with the Mendicant came to tea in fulfilment of an engagement made through her father And the way in which the Mendicant s bride dashed at the unassailable position so considerately to be held by Miss Lavy and scattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment was triumphant Dearest Ma cried Bella running into the room with a radiant face how do you do dearest Ma And then embraced her joyously And Lavvy darling how do YOU do and how s George Sampson and how is he getting on and when are you going to be married and how rich are you going to grow You must tell me all about it Lavvy dear immediately John love kiss Ma and Lavvy and then we shall all be at home and comfortable missus Wilfer stared but was helpless Miss Lavinia stared but was helpless Apparently with no compunction and assuredly with no ceremony Bella tossed her bonnet away and sat down to make the tea Dearest Ma and Lavvy you both take sugar I know And Pa you good little Pa you don t take milk John does I didn t before I was married but I do now because John does John dear did you kiss Ma and Lavvy Oh you did Quite correct John dear but I didn t see you do it so I asked Cut some bread and butter John that s a love Ma likes it doubled And now you must tell me dearest Ma and Lavvy upon your words and honours Didn t you for a moment just a moment think I was a dreadful little wretch when I wrote to say I had run away Before missus Wilfer could wave her gloves the Mendicant s bride in her merriest affectionate manner went on again I think it must have made you rather cross dear Ma and Lavvy and I know I deserved that you should be very cross But you see I had been such a heedless heartless creature and had led you so to expect that I should marry for money and so to make sure that I was incapable of marrying for love that I thought you couldn t believe me Because you see you didn t know how much of Good Good Good I had learnt from John Well So I was sly about it and ashamed of what you supposed me to be and fearful that we couldn t understand one another and might come to words which we should all be sorry for afterwards and so I said to John that if he liked to take me without any fuss he might And as he did like I let him And we were married at Greenwich church in the presence of nobody except an unknown individual who dropped in here her eyes sparkled more brightly and half a pensioner And now isn t it nice dearest Ma and Lavvy to know that no words have been said which any of us can be sorry for and that we are all the best of friends at the pleasantest of teas Having got up and kissed them again she slipped back to her chair after a loop on the road to squeeze her husband round the neck and again went on And now you will naturally want to know dearest Ma and Lavvy how we live and what we have got to live upon Well And so we live on Blackheath in the charm ingest of dolls houses de lightfully furnished and we have a clever little servant who is de cidedly pretty and we are economical and orderly and do everything by clockwork and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year and we have all we want and more And lastly if you would like to know in confidence as perhaps you may what is my opinion of my husband my opinion is that I almost love him And if you would like to know in confidence as perhaps you may said her husband smiling as he stood by her side without her having detected his approach my opinion of my wife my opinion is But Bella started up and put her hand upon his lips Stop Sir No John dear Seriously Please not yet a while I want to be something so much worthier than the doll in the doll s house My darling are you not Not half not a quarter so much worthier as I hope you may some day find me Try me through some reverse John try me through some trial and tell them after THAT what you think of me I will my Life said John I promise it That s my dear John And you won t speak a word now will you And I won t said John with a very expressive look of admiration around him speak a word now She laid her laughing cheek upon his breast to thank him and said looking at the rest of them sideways out of her bright eyes I ll go further Pa and Ma and Lavvy John don t suspect it he has no idea of it but I quite love him Even missus Wilfer relaxed under the influence of her married daughter and seemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if R W had been a more deserving object she too might have condescended to come down from her pedestal for his beguilement Miss Lavinia on the other hand had strong doubts of the policy of the course of treatment and whether it might not spoil mister Sampson if experimented on in the case of that young gentleman R W himself was for his part convinced that he was father of one of the most charming of girls and that Rokesmith was the most favoured of men which opinion if propounded to him Rokesmith would probably not have contested The newly married pair left early so that they might walk at leisure to their starting place from London for Greenwich At first they were very cheerful and talked much but after a while Bella fancied that her husband was turning somewhat thoughtful So she asked him John dear what s the matter Matter my love Won t you tell me said Bella looking up into his face what you are thinking of There s not much in the thought my soul I was thinking whether you wouldn t like me to be rich You rich John repeated Bella shrinking a little I mean really rich Say as rich as mister Boffin You would like that I should be almost afraid to try John dear Was he much the better for his wealth Was I much the better for the little part I once had in it But all people are not the worse for riches my own Most people Bella musingly suggested with raised eyebrows Nor even most people it may be hoped If you were rich for instance you would have a great power of doing good to others Yes sir for instance Bella playfully rejoined but should I exercise the power for instance And again sir for instance should I at the same time have a great power of doing harm to myself Laughing and pressing her arm he retorted But still again for instance would you exercise that power I don t know said Bella thoughtfully shaking her head I hope not I think not But it s so easy to hope not and think not without the riches Why don t you say my darling instead of that phrase being poor he asked looking earnestly at her Why don t I say being poor Because I am not poor Dear John it s not possible that you suppose I think we are poor I do my love Oh John Understand me sweetheart I know that I am rich beyond all wealth in having you but I think OF you and think FOR you In such a dress as you are wearing now you first charmed me and in no dress could you ever look to my thinking more graceful or more beautiful But you have admired many finer dresses this very day and is it not natural that I wish I could give them to you It s very nice that you should wish it John It brings these tears of grateful pleasure into my eyes to hear you say so with such tenderness But I don t want them Again he pursued we are now walking through the muddy streets I love those pretty feet so dearly that I feel as if I could not bear the dirt to soil the sole of your shoe Is it not natural that I wish you could ride in a carriage It s very nice said Bella glancing downward at the feet in question to know that you admire them so much John dear and since you do I am sorry that these shoes are a full size too large But I don t want a carriage believe me You would like one if you could have one Bella I shouldn t like it for its own sake half so well as such a wish for it Dear John your wishes are as real to me as the wishes in the Fairy story that were all fulfilled as soon as spoken Wish me everything that you can wish for the woman you dearly love and I have as good as got it John I have better than got it John They were not the less happy for such talk and home was not the less home for coming after it Bella was fast developing a perfect genius for home All the loves and graces seemed her husband thought to have taken domestic service with her and to help her to make home engaging Her married life glided happily on She was alone all day for after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City and did not return until their late dinner hour He was in a China house he explained to Bella which she found quite satisfactory without pursuing the China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea rice odd smelling silks carved boxes and tight eyed people in more than double soled shoes with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off painted on transparent porcelain She always walked with her husband to the railroad and was always there again to meet him her old coquettish ways a little sobered down but not much and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else But John gone to business and Bella returned home the dress would be laid aside trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted and Bella putting back her hair with both hands as if she were making the most business like arrangements for going dramatically distracted would enter on the household affairs of the day Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating such dusting and washing and polishing such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening such making and mending and folding and airing such diverse arrangements and above all such severe study For missus J R who had never been wont to do too much at home as Miss B W was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife which she would sit consulting with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art This principally because the Complete British Housewife however sound a Briton at heart was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language In any crisis of this nature Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud Oh you ridiculous old thing what do you mean by that You must have been drinking And having made this marginal note would try the Housewife again with all her dimples screwed into an expression of profound research There was likewise a coolness on the part of the British Housewife which missus John Rokesmith found highly exasperating She would say Take a salamander as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar Or she would casually issue the order Throw in a handful of something entirely unattainable In these the Housewife s most glaring moments of unreason Bella would shut her up and knock her on the table apostrophising her with the compliment O you ARE a stupid old Donkey Where am I to get it do you think Another branch of study claimed the attention of missus John Rokesmith for a regular period every day This was the mastering of the newspaper so that she might be close up with John on general topics when John came home In her desire to be in all things his companion she would have set herself with equal zeal to master Algebra or Euclid if he had divided his soul between her and either Wonderful was the way in which she would store up the City Intelligence and beamingly shed it upon John in the course of the evening incidentally mentioning the commodities that were looking up in the markets and how much gold had been taken to the Bank and trying to look wise and serious over it until she would laugh at herself most charmingly and would say kissing him It all comes of my love John dear For a City man John certainly did appear to care as little as might be for the looking up or looking down of things as well as for the gold that got taken to the Bank But he cared beyond all expression for his wife as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up and that never was worth less than all the gold in the world And she being inspired by her affection and having a quick wit and a fine ready instinct made amazing progress in her domestic efficiency though as an endearing creature she made no progress at all This was her husband s verdict and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be And you have such a cheerful spirit he said fondly You are like a bright light in the house Am I truly John Are you truly Yes indeed Only much more and much better Do you know John dear said Bella taking him by a button of his coat that I sometimes at odd moments don t laugh John please Nothing should induce John to do it when she asked him not to do it That I sometimes think John I feel a little serious Are you too much alone my darling O dear no John The time is so short that I have not a moment too much in the week Why serious my life then When serious When I laugh I think said Bella laughing as she laid her head upon his shoulder You wouldn t believe sir that I feel serious now But I do And she laughed again and something glistened in her eyes Would you like to be rich pet he asked her coaxingly Rich John How CAN you ask such goose s questions Do you regret anything my love Regret anything No Bella confidently answered But then suddenly changing she said between laughing and glistening Oh yes I do though I regret missus Boffin I too regret that separation very much But perhaps it is only temporary Perhaps things may so fall out as that you may sometimes see her again as that we may sometimes see her again Bella might be very anxious on the subject but she scarcely seemed so at the moment With an absent air she was investigating that button on her husband s coat when Pa came in to spend the evening Pa had his special chair and his special corner reserved for him on all occasions and without disparagement of his domestic joys was far happier there than anywhere It was always pleasantly droll to see Pa and Bella together but on this present evening her husband thought her more than usually fantastic with him You are a very good little boy said Bella to come unexpectedly as soon as you could get out of school And how have they used you at school to day you dear Well my pet replied the cherub smiling and rubbing his hands as she sat him down in his chair I attend two schools There s the Mincing Lane establishment and there s your mother s Academy Which might you mean my dear Both said Bella Both eh Why to say the truth both have taken a little out of me to day my dear but that was to be expected There s no royal road to learning and what is life but learning And what do you do with yourself when you have got your learning by heart you silly child Why then my dear said the cherub after a little consideration I suppose I die You are a very bad boy retorted Bella to talk about dismal things and be out of spirits My Bella rejoined her father I am not out of spirits I am as gay as a lark Which his face confirmed Then if you are sure and certain it s not you I suppose it must be I said Bella so I won t do so any more John dear we must give this little fellow his supper you know Of course we must my darling He has been grubbing and grubbing at school said Bella looking at her father s hand and lightly slapping it till he s not fit to be seen O what a grubby child Indeed my dear said her father I was going to ask to be allowed to wash my hands only you find me out so soon Come here sir cried Bella taking him by the front of his coat come here and be washed directly You are not to be trusted to do it for yourself Come here sir The cherub to his genial amusement was accordingly conducted to a little washing room where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face and soaped his hands and rubbed his hands and splashed him and rinsed him and towelled him until he was as red as beet root even to his very ears Now you must be brushed and combed sir said Bella busily Hold the light John Shut your eyes sir and let me take hold of your chin Be good directly and do as you are told Her father being more than willing to obey she dressed his hair in her most elaborate manner brushing it out straight parting it winding it over her fingers sticking it up on end and constantly falling back on John to get a good look at the effect of it Who always received her on his disengaged arm and detained her while the patient cherub stood waiting to be finished There said Bella when she had at last completed the final touches Now you are something like a genteel boy Put your jacket on and come and have your supper The cherub investing himself with his coat was led back to his corner where but for having no egotism in his pleasant nature he would have answered well enough for that radiant though self sufficient boy Jack Horner Bella with her own hands laid a cloth for him and brought him his supper on a tray Stop a moment said she we must keep his little clothes clean and tied a napkin under his chin in a very methodical manner While he took his supper Bella sat by him sometimes admonishing him to hold his fork by the handle like a polite child and at other times carving for him or pouring out his drink Fantastic as it all was and accustomed as she ever had been to make a plaything of her good father ever delighted that she should put him to that account still there was an occasional something on Bella s part that was new It could not be said that she was less playful whimsical or natural than she always had been but it seemed her husband thought as if there were some rather graver reason than he had supposed for what she had so lately said and as if throughout all this there were glimpses of an underlying seriousness It was a circumstance in support of this view of the case that when she had lighted her father s pipe and mixed him his glass of grog she sat down on a stool between her father and her husband leaning her arm upon the latter and was very quiet So quiet that when her father rose to take his leave she looked round with a start as if she had forgotten his being there You go a little way with Pa John Yes my dear Do you I have not written to Lizzie Hexam since I wrote and told her that I really had a lover a whole one I have often thought I would like to tell her how right she was when she pretended to read in the live coals that I would go through fire and water for him I am in the humour to tell her so to night John and I ll stay at home and do it You are tired Not at all tired John dear but in the humour to write to Lizzie Good night dear Pa Good night you dear good gentle Pa Left to herself she sat down to write and wrote Lizzie a long letter She had but completed it and read it over when her husband came back You are just in time sir said Bella I am going to give you your first curtain lecture It shall be a parlour curtain lecture You shall take this chair of mine when I have folded my letter and I will take the stool though you ought to take it I can tell you sir if it s the stool of repentance and you ll soon find yourself taken to task soundly Her letter folded sealed and directed and her pen wiped and her middle finger wiped and her desk locked up and put away and these transactions performed with an air of severe business sedateness which the Complete British Housewife might have assumed and certainly would not have rounded off and broken down in with a musical laugh as Bella did she placed her husband in his chair and placed herself upon her stool Now sir To begin at the beginning What is your name A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her could not have astounded him But he kept his countenance and his secret and answered John Rokesmith my dear Good boy Who gave you that name With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to her he answered interrogatively My godfathers and my godmothers dear love Pretty good said Bella Not goodest good because you hesitate about it However as you know your Catechism fairly so far I ll let you off the rest Now I am going to examine you out of my own head John dear why did you go back this evening to the question you once asked me before would I like to be rich Again his secret He looked down at her as she looked up at him with her hands folded on his knee and it was as nearly told as ever secret was Having no reply ready he could do no better than embrace her In short dear John said Bella this is the topic of my lecture I want nothing on earth and I want you to believe it If that s all the lecture may be considered over for I do It s not all John dear Bella hesitated It s only Firstly There s a dreadful Secondly and a dreadful Thirdly to come as I used to say to myself in sermon time when I was a very small sized sinner at church Let them come my dearest Are you sure John dear are you absolutely certain in your innermost heart of hearts Which is not in my keeping he rejoined No John but the key is Are you absolutely certain that down at the bottom of that heart of hearts which you have given to me as I have given mine to you there is no remembrance that I was once very mercenary Why if there were no remembrance in me of the time you speak of he softly asked her with his lips to hers could I love you quite as well as I do could I have in the Calendar of my life the brightest of its days could I whenever I look at your dear face or hear your dear voice see and hear my noble champion It can never have been that which made you serious darling No John it wasn t that and still less was it missus Boffin though I love her Wait a moment and I ll go on with the lecture Give me a moment because I like to cry for joy It s so delicious John dear to cry for joy She did so on his neck and still clinging there laughed a little when she said I think I am ready now for Thirdly John I am ready for Thirdly said John whatever it is I believe John pursued Bella that you believe that I believe My dear child cried her husband gaily what a quantity of believing Isn t there said Bella with another laugh I never knew such a quantity It s like verbs in an exercise But I can t get on with less believing I ll try again I believe dear John that you believe that I believe that we have as much money as we require and that we want for nothing It is strictly true Bella But if our money should by any means be rendered not so much if we had to stint ourselves a little in purchases that we can afford to make now would you still have the same confidence in my being quite contented John Precisely the same confidence my soul Thank you John dear thousands upon thousands of times And I may take it for granted no doubt with a little faltering that you would be quite as contented yourself John But yes I know I may For knowing that I should be so how surely I may know that you would be so you who are so much stronger and firmer and more reasonable and more generous than I am Hush said her husband I must not hear that You are all wrong there though otherwise as right as can be And now I am brought to a little piece of news my dearest that I might have told you earlier in the evening I have strong reason for confidently believing that we shall never be in the receipt of a smaller income than our present income She might have shown herself more interested in the intelligence but she had returned to the investigation of the coat button that had engaged her attention a few hours before and scarcely seemed to heed what he said And now we have got to the bottom of it at last cried her husband rallying her and this is the thing that made you serious No dear said Bella twisting the button and shaking her head it wasn t this Why then Lord bless this little wife of mine there s a Fourthly exclaimed John This worried me a little and so did Secondly said Bella occupied with the button but it was quite another sort of seriousness a much deeper and quieter sort of seriousness that I spoke of John dear As he bent his face to hers she raised hers to meet it and laid her little right hand on his eyes and kept it there Do you remember John on the day we were married Pa s speaking of the ships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas Perfectly my darling I think among them there is a ship upon the ocean bringing to you and me a little baby John Chapter six A CRY FOR HELP The Paper Mill had stopped work for the night and the paths and roads in its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day s labour in it There were men women and children in the groups and there was no want of lively colour to flutter in the gentle evening wind The mingling of various voices and the sound of laughter made a cheerful impression upon the ear analogous to that of the fluttering colours upon the eye Into the sheet of water reflecting the flushed sky in the foreground of the living picture a knot of urchins were casting stones and watching the expansion of the rippling circles So in the rosy evening one might watch the ever widening beauty of the landscape beyond the newly released workers wending home beyond the silver river beyond the deep green fields of corn so prospering that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast high beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees beyond the windmills on the ridge away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and Heaven It was a Saturday evening and at such a time the village dogs always much more interested in the doings of humanity than in the affairs of their own species were particularly active At the general shop at the butcher s and at the public house they evinced an inquiring spirit never to be satiated Their especial interest in the public house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character for little was eaten there and they having no taste for beer or tobacco missus Hubbard s dog is said to have smoked but proof is wanting could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits Moreover a most wretched fiddle played within a fiddle so unutterably vile that one lean long bodied cur with a better ear than the rest found himself under compulsion at intervals to go round the corner and howl Yet even he returned to the public house on each occasion with the tenacity of a confirmed drunkard Fearful to relate there was even a sort of little Fair in the village Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification again appealed to the public from an infirm booth So did a heap of nuts long long exiled from Barcelona and yet speaking English so indifferently as to call fourteen of themselves a pint A Peep show which had originally started with the Battle of Waterloo and had since made it every other battle of later date by altering the Duke of Wellington s nose tempted the student of illustrated history A Fat Lady perhaps in part sustained upon postponed pork her professional associate being a Learned Pig displayed her life size picture in a low dress as she appeared when presented at Court several yards round All this was a vicious spectacle as any poor idea of amusement on the part of the rougher hewers of wood and drawers of water in this land of England ever is and shall be They MUST NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement They may vary it with fever and ague or with as many rheumatic variations as they have joints but positively not with entertainment after their own manner The various sounds arising from this scene of depravity and floating away into the still evening air made the evening at any point which they just reached fitfully mellowed by the distance more still by contrast Such was the stillness of the evening to Eugene Wrayburn as he walked by the river with his hands behind him He walked slowly and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one who was waiting He walked between the two points an osier bed at this end and some floating lilies at that and at each point stopped and looked expectantly in one direction It is very quiet said he It was very quiet Some sheep were grazing on the grass by the river side and it seemed to him that he had never before heard the crisp tearing sound with which they cropped it He stopped idly and looked at them You are stupid enough I suppose But if you are clever enough to get through life tolerably to your satisfaction you have got the better of me Man as I am and Mutton as you are A rustle in a field beyond the hedge attracted his attention What s here to do he asked himself leisurely going towards the gate and looking over No jealous paper miller No pleasures of the chase in this part of the country Mostly fishing hereabouts The field had been newly mown and there were yet the marks of the scythe on the yellow green ground and the track of wheels where the hay had been carried Following the tracks with his eyes the view closed with the new hayrick in a corner Now if he had gone on to the hayrick and gone round it But say that the event was to be as the event fell out and how idle are such suppositions Besides if he had gone what is there of warning in a Bargeman lying on his face A bird flying to the hedge was all he thought about it and came back and resumed his walk If I had not a reliance on her being truthful said Eugene after taking some half dozen turns I should begin to think she had given me the slip for the second time But she promised and she is a girl of her word Turning again at the water lilies he saw her coming and advanced to meet her I was saying to myself Lizzie that you were sure to come though you were late I had to linger through the village as if I had no object before me and I had to speak to several people in passing along mister Wrayburn Are the lads of the village and the ladies such scandal mongers he asked as he took her hand and drew it through his arm She submitted to walk slowly on with downcast eyes He put her hand to his lips and she quietly drew it away Will you walk beside me mister Wrayburn and not touch me For his arm was already stealing round her waist She stopped again and gave him an earnest supplicating look Well Lizzie well said he in an easy way though ill at ease with himself don t be unhappy don t be reproachful I cannot help being unhappy but I do not mean to be reproachful mister Wrayburn I implore you to go away from this neighbourhood to morrow morning Lizzie Lizzie Lizzie he remonstrated As well be reproachful as wholly unreasonable I can t go away Why not Faith said Eugene in his airily candid manner Because you won t let me Mind I don t mean to be reproachful either I don t complain that you design to keep me here But you do it you do it Will you walk beside me and not touch me for his arm was coming about her again while I speak to you very seriously mister Wrayburn I will do anything within the limits of possibility for you Lizzie he answered with pleasant gaiety as he folded his arms See here Napoleon Buonaparte at saint Helena When you spoke to me as I came from the Mill the night before last said Lizzie fixing her eyes upon him with the look of supplication which troubled his better nature you told me that you were much surprised to see me and that you were on a solitary fishing excursion Was it true It was not replied Eugene composedly in the least true I came here because I had information that I should find you here Can you imagine why I left London mister Wrayburn I am afraid Lizzie he openly answered that you left London to get rid of me It is not flattering to my self love but I am afraid you did I did How could you be so cruel O mister Wrayburn she answered suddenly breaking into tears is the cruelty on my side O mister Wrayburn mister Wrayburn is there no cruelty in your being here to night In the name of all that s good and that is not conjuring you in my own name for Heaven knows I am not good said Eugene don t be distressed What else can I be when I know the distance and the difference between us What else can I be when to tell me why you came here is to put me to shame said Lizzie covering her face He looked at her with a real sentiment of remorseful tenderness and pity It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and spare her but it was a strong emotion Lizzie I never thought before that there was a woman in the world who could affect me so much by saying so little But don t be hard in your construction of me You don t know what my state of mind towards you is You don t know how you haunt me and bewilder me You don t know how the cursed carelessness that is over officious in helping me at every other turning of my life WON T help me here You have struck it dead I think and I sometimes almost wish you had struck me dead along with it She had not been prepared for such passionate expressions and they awakened some natural sparks of feminine pride and joy in her breast To consider wrong as he was that he could care so much for her and that she had the power to move him so It grieves you to see me distressed mister Wrayburn it grieves me to see you distressed I don t reproach you Indeed I don t reproach you You have not felt this as I feel it being so different from me and beginning from another point of view You have not thought But I entreat you to think now think now What am I to think of asked Eugene bitterly Think of me Tell me how NOT to think of you Lizzie and you ll change me altogether I don t mean in that way Think of me as belonging to another station and quite cut off from you in honour Remember that I have no protector near me unless I have one in your noble heart Respect my good name If you feel towards me in one particular as you might if I was a lady give me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour I am removed from you and your family by being a working girl How true a gentleman to be as considerate of me as if I was removed by being a Queen He would have been base indeed to have stood untouched by her appeal His face expressed contrition and indecision as he asked Have I injured you so much Lizzie No no You may set me quite right I don t speak of the past mister Wrayburn but of the present and the future Are we not here now because through two days you have followed me so closely where there are so many eyes to see you that I consented to this appointment as an escape Again not very flattering to my self love said Eugene moodily but yes Yes Yes Then I beseech you mister Wrayburn I beg and pray you leave this neighbourhood If you do not consider to what you will drive me He did consider within himself for a moment or two and then retorted Drive you To what shall I drive you Lizzie You will drive me away I live here peacefully and respected and I am well employed here You will force me to quit this place as I quitted London and by following me again will force me to quit the next place in which I may find refuge as I quitted this Are you so determined Lizzie forgive the word I am going to use for its literal truth to fly from a lover I am so determined she answered resolutely though trembling to fly from such a lover There was a poor woman died here but a little while ago scores of years older than I am whom I found by chance lying on the wet earth You may have heard some account of her I think I have he answered if her name was Higden Her name was Higden Though she was so weak and old she kept true to one purpose to the very last Even at the very last she made me promise that her purpose should be kept to after she was dead so settled was her determination What she did I can do mister Wrayburn if I believed but I do not believe that you could be so cruel to me as to drive me from place to place to wear me out you should drive me to death and not do it He looked full at her handsome face and in his own handsome face there was a light of blended admiration anger and reproach which she who loved him so in secret whose heart had long been so full and he the cause of its overflowing drooped before She tried hard to retain her firmness but he saw it melting away under his eyes In the moment of its dissolution and of his first full knowledge of his influence upon her she dropped and he caught her on his arm Lizzie Rest so a moment Answer what I ask you If I had not been what you call removed from you and cut off from you would you have made this appeal to me to leave you I don t know I don t know Don t ask me mister Wrayburn Let me go back I swear to you Lizzie you shall go directly I swear to you you shall go alone I ll not accompany you I ll not follow you if you will reply How can I mister Wrayburn How can I tell you what I should have done if you had not been what you are If I had not been what you make me out to be he struck in skilfully changing the form of words would you still have hated me O mister Wrayburn she replied appealingly and weeping you know me better than to think I do If I had not been what you make me out to be Lizzie would you still have been indifferent to me O mister Wrayburn she answered as before you know me better than that too There was something in the attitude of her whole figure as he supported it and she hung her head which besought him to be merciful and not force her to disclose her heart He was not merciful with her and he made her do it If I know you better than quite to believe unfortunate dog though I am that you hate me or even that you are wholly indifferent to me Lizzie let me know so much more from yourself before we separate Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you It is impossible mister Wrayburn How can I think of you as being on equal terms with me If my mind could put you on equal terms with me you could not be yourself How could I remember then the night when I first saw you and when I went out of the room because you looked at me so attentively Or the night that passed into the morning when you broke to me that my father was dead Or the nights when you used to come to see me at my next home Or your having known how uninstructed I was and having caused me to be taught better Or my having so looked up to you and wondered at you and at first thought you so good to be at all mindful of me Only at first thought me so good Lizzie What did you think me after at first So bad I don t say that I don t mean that But after the first wonder and pleasure of being noticed by one so different from any one who had ever spoken to me I began to feel that it might have been better if I had never seen you Why Because you WERE so different she answered in a lower voice Because it was so endless so hopeless Spare me Did you think for me at all Lizzie he asked as if he were a little stung Not much mister Wrayburn Not much until to night Will you tell me why I never supposed until to night that you needed to be thought for But if you do need to be if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called yourself to night and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation then Heaven help you and Heaven bless you The purity with which in these words she expressed something of her own love and her own suffering made a deep impression on him for the passing time He held her almost as if she were sanctified to him by death and kissed her once almost as he might have kissed the dead I promised that I would not accompany you nor follow you Shall I keep you in view You have been agitated and it s growing dark I am used to be out alone at this hour and I entreat you not to do so I promise I can bring myself to promise nothing more tonight Lizzie except that I will try what I can do There is but one means mister Wrayburn of sparing yourself and of sparing me every way Leave this neighbourhood to morrow morning I will try As he spoke the words in a grave voice she put her hand in his removed it and went away by the river side Now could Mortimer believe this murmured Eugene still remaining after a while where she had left him Can I even believe it myself He referred to the circumstance that there were tears upon his hand as he stood covering his eyes A most ridiculous position this to be found out in was his next thought And his next struck its root in a little rising resentment against the cause of the tears Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her too let her be as much in earnest as she will The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she had drooped under his gaze Contemplating the reproduction he seemed to see for the second time in the appeal and in the confession of weakness a little fear And she loves me And so earnest a character must be very earnest in that passion She cannot choose for herself to be strong in this fancy wavering in that and weak in the other She must go through with her nature as I must go through with mine If mine exacts its pains and penalties all round so must hers I suppose Pursuing the inquiry into his own nature he thought Now if I married her If outfacing the absurdity of the situation in correspondence with M R F I astonished M R F to the utmost extent of his respected powers by informing him that I had married her how would M R F reason with the legal mind You wouldn t marry for some money and some station because you were frightfully likely to become bored Are you less frightfully likely to become bored marrying for no money and no station Are you sure of yourself Legal mind in spite of forensic protestations must secretly admit Good reasoning on the part of M R F NOT sure of myself In the very act of calling this tone of levity to his aid he felt it to be profligate and worthless and asserted her against it And yet said Eugene I should like to see the fellow Mortimer excepted who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real sentiment on my part won out of me by her beauty and her worth in spite of myself and that I would not be true to her I should particularly like to see the fellow to night who would tell me so or who would tell me anything that could be construed to her disadvantage for I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure and I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else Eugene Eugene Eugene this is a bad business Ah So go the Mortimer Lightwood bells and they sound melancholy to night Strolling on he thought of something else to take himself to task for Where is the analogy Brute Beast he said impatiently between a woman whom your father coolly finds out for you and a woman whom you have found out for yourself and have ever drifted after with more and more of constancy since you first set eyes upon her Ass Can you reason no better than that But again he subsided into a reminiscence of his first full knowledge of his power just now and of her disclosure of her heart To try no more to go away and to try her again was the reckless conclusion it turned uppermost And yet again Eugene Eugene Eugene this is a bad business And I wish I could stop the Lightwood peal for it sounds like a knell Looking above he found that the young moon was up and that the stars were beginning to shine in the sky from which the tones of red and yellow were flickering out in favour of the calm blue of a summer night He was still by the river side Turning suddenly he met a man so close upon him that Eugene surprised stepped back to avoid a collision The man carried something over his shoulder which might have been a broken oar or spar or bar and took no notice of him but passed on Halloa friend said Eugene calling after him are you blind The man made no reply but went his way Eugene Wrayburn went the opposite way with his hands behind him and his purpose in his thoughts He passed the sheep and passed the gate and came within hearing of the village sounds and came to the bridge The inn where he stayed like the village and the mill was not across the river but on that side of the stream on which he walked However knowing the rushy bank and the backwater on the other side to be a retired place and feeling out of humour for noise or company he crossed the bridge and sauntered on looking up at the stars as they seemed one by one to be kindled in the sky and looking down at the river as the same stars seemed to be kindled deep in the water A landing place overshadowed by a willow and a pleasure boat lying moored there among some stakes caught his eye as he passed along The spot was in such dark shadow that he paused to make out what was there and then passed on again The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his uneasy reflections He would have laid them asleep if he could but they were in movement like the stream and all tending one way with a strong current As the ripple under the moon broke unexpectedly now and then and palely flashed in a new shape and with a new sound so parts of his thoughts started unbidden from the rest and revealed their wickedness Out of the question to marry her said Eugene and out of the question to leave her The crisis He had sauntered far enough Before turning to retrace his steps he stopped upon the margin to look down at the reflected night In an instant with a dreadful crash the reflected night turned crooked flames shot jaggedly across the air and the moon and stars came bursting from the sky Was he struck by lightning With some incoherent half formed thought to that effect he turned under the blows that were blinding him and mashing his life and closed with a murderer whom he caught by a red neckerchief unless the raining down of his own blood gave it that hue Eugene was light active and expert but his arms were broken or he was paralysed and could do no more than hang on to the man with his head swung back so that he could see nothing but the heaving sky After dragging at the assailant he fell on the bank with him and then there was another great crash and then a splash and all was done Lizzie Hexam too had avoided the noise and the Saturday movement of people in the straggling street and chose to walk alone by the water until her tears should be dry and she could so compose herself as to escape remark upon her looking ill or unhappy on going home The peaceful serenity of the hour and place having no reproaches or evil intentions within her breast to contend against sank healingly into its depths She had meditated and taken comfort She too was turning homeward when she heard a strange sound It startled her for it was like a sound of blows She stood still and listened It sickened her for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night As she listened undecided all was silent As she yet listened she heard a faint groan and a fall into the river Her old bold life and habit instantly inspired her Without vain waste of breath in crying for help where there were none to hear she ran towards the spot from which the sounds had come It lay between her and the bridge but it was more removed from her than she had thought the night being so very quiet and sound travelling far with the help of water At length she reached a part of the green bank much and newly trodden where there lay some broken splintered pieces of wood and some torn fragments of clothes Stooping she saw that the grass was bloody Following the drops and smears she saw that the watery margin of the bank was bloody Following the current with her eyes she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon and drifting away Now merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time and grant O Blessed Lord that through thy wonderful workings it may turn to good at last To whomsoever the drifting face belongs be it man s or woman s help my humble hands Lord God to raise it from death and restore it to some one to whom it must be dear It was thought fervently thought but not for a moment did the prayer check her She was away before it welled up in her mind away swift and true yet steady above all for without steadiness it could never be done to the landing place under the willow tree where she also had seen the boat lying moored among the stakes A sure touch of her old practised hand a sure step of her old practised foot a sure light balance of her body and she was in the boat A quick glance of her practised eye showed her even through the deep dark shadow the sculls in a rack against the red brick garden wall Another moment and she had cast off taking the line with her and the boat had shot out into the moonlight and she was rowing down the stream as never other woman rowed on English water Intently over her shoulder without slackening speed she looked ahead for the driving face She passed the scene of the struggle yonder it was on her left well over the boat s stern she passed on her right the end of the village street a hilly street that almost dipped into the river its sounds were growing faint again and she slackened looking as the boat drove everywhere everywhere for the floating face She merely kept the boat before the stream now and rested on her oars knowing well that if the face were not soon visible it had gone down and she would overshoot it An untrained sight would never have seen by the moonlight what she saw at the length of a few strokes astern She saw the drowning figure rise to the surface slightly struggle and as if by instinct turn over on its back to float Just so had she first dimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again Firm of look and firm of purpose she intently watched its coming on until it was very near then with a touch unshipped her sculls and crept aft in the boat between kneeling and crouching Once she let the body evade her not being sure of her grasp Twice and she had seized it by its bloody hair It was insensible if not virtually dead it was mutilated and streaked the water all about it with dark red streaks As it could not help itself it was impossible for her to get it on board She bent over the stern to secure it with the line and then the river and its shores rang to the terrible cry she uttered But as if possessed by supernatural spirit and strength she lashed it safe resumed her seat and rowed in desperately for the nearest shallow water where she might run the boat aground Desperately but not wildly for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention all was lost and gone She ran the boat ashore went into the water released him from the line and by main strength lifted him in her arms and laid him in the bottom of the boat He had fearful wounds upon him and she bound them up with her dress torn into strips Else supposing him to be still alive she foresaw that he must bleed to death before he could be landed at his inn which was the nearest place for succour This done very rapidly she kissed his disfigured forehead looked up in anguish to the stars and blessed him and forgave him if she had anything to forgive It was only in that instant that she thought of herself and then she thought of herself only for him Now merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time enabling me without a wasted moment to have got the boat afloat again and to row back against the stream And grant O Blessed Lord God that through poor me he may be raised from death and preserved to some one else to whom he may be dear one day though never dearer than to me She rowed hard rowed desperately but never wildly and seldom removed her eyes from him in the bottom of the boat She had so laid him there as that she might see his disfigured face it was so much disfigured that his mother might have covered it but it was above and beyond disfigurement in her eyes The boat touched the edge of the patch of inn lawn sloping gently to the water There were lights in the windows but there chanced to be no one out of doors She made the boat fast and again by main strength took him up and never laid him down until she laid him down in the house Surgeons were sent for and she sat supporting his head She had oftentimes heard in days that were gone how doctors would lift the hand of an insensible wounded person and would drop it if the person were dead She waited for the awful moment when the doctors might lift this hand all broken and bruised and let it fall The first of the surgeons came and asked before proceeding to his examination Who brought him in I brought him in sir answered Lizzie at whom all present looked You my dear You could not lift far less carry this weight I think I could not at another time sir but I am sure I did The surgeon looked at her with great attention and with some compassion Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head and the broken arms he took the hand O would he let it drop He appeared irresolute He did not retain it but laid it gently down took a candle looked more closely at the injuries on the head and at the pupils of the eyes That done he replaced the candle and took the hand again Another surgeon then coming in the two exchanged a whisper and the second took the hand Neither did he let it fall at once but kept it for a while and laid it gently down Attend to the poor girl said the first surgeon then She is quite unconscious She sees nothing and hears nothing All the better for her Don t rouse her if you can help it only move her Poor girl poor girl She must be amazingly strong of heart but it is much to be feared that she has set her heart upon the dead Be gentle with her Chapter seven BETTER TO BE ABEL THAN CAIN Day was breaking at Plashwater Weir Mill Lock Stars were yet visible but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night The moon had gone down and a mist crept along the banks of the river seen through which the trees were the ghosts of trees and the water was the ghost of water This earth looked spectral and so did the pale stars while the cold eastern glare expressionless as to heat or colour with the eye of the firmament quenched might have been likened to the stare of the dead Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely Bargeman standing on the brink of the lock For certain Bradley Headstone looked that way when a chill air came up and when it passed on murmuring as if it whispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble or threaten for fancy might have made it either He turned away and tried the Lock house door It was fastened on the inside Is he afraid of me he muttered knocking Rogue Riderhood was soon roused and soon undrew the bolt and let him in Why T otherest I thought you had been and got lost Two nights away I a most believed as you d giv me the slip and I had as good as half a mind for to advertise you in the newspapers to come for ard Bradley s face turned so dark on this hint that Riderhood deemed it expedient to soften it into a compliment But not you governor not you he went on stolidly shaking his head For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea as a sort of a playful game Why I says to myself He s a man o honour That s what I says to myself He s a man o double honour Very remarkably Riderhood put no question to him He had looked at him on opening the door and he now looked at him again stealthily this time and the result of his looking was that he asked him no question You ll be for another forty on em governor as I judges afore you turns your mind to breakfast said Riderhood when his visitor sat down resting his chin on his hand with his eyes on the ground And very remarkably again Riderhood feigned to set the scanty furniture in order while he spoke to have a show of reason for not looking at him Yes I had better sleep I think said Bradley without changing his position I myself should recommend it governor assented Riderhood Might you be anyways dry Yes I should like a drink said Bradley but without appearing to attend much mister Riderhood got out his bottle and fetched his jug full of water and administered a potation Then he shook the coverlet of his bed and spread it smooth and Bradley stretched himself upon it in the clothes he wore mister Riderhood poetically remarking that he would pick the bones of his night s rest in his wooden chair sat in the window as before but as before watched the sleeper narrowly until he was very sound asleep Then he rose and looked at him close in the bright daylight on every side with great minuteness He went out to his Lock to sum up what he had seen One of his sleeves is tore right away below the elber and the t other s had a good rip at the shoulder He s been hung on to pretty tight for his shirt s all tore out of the neck gathers He s been in the grass and he s been in the water And he s spotted and I know with what and with whose Hooroar Bradley slept long Early in the afternoon a barge came down Other barges had passed through both ways before it but the Lock keeper hailed only this particular barge for news as if he had made a time calculation with some nicety The men on board told him a piece of news and there was a lingering on their part to enlarge upon it Twelve hours had intervened since Bradley s lying down when he got up Not that I swaller it said Riderhood squinting at his Lock when he saw Bradley coming out of the house as you ve been a sleeping all the time old boy Bradley came to him sitting on his wooden lever and asked what o clock it was Riderhood told him it was between two and three When are you relieved asked Bradley Day arter to morrow governor Not sooner Not a inch sooner governor On both sides importance seemed attached to this question of relief Riderhood quite petted his reply saying a second time and prolonging a negative roll of his head n n not a inch sooner governor Did I tell you I was going on to night asked Bradley No governor returned Riderhood in a cheerful affable and conversational manner you did not tell me so But most like you meant to it and forgot to it How otherways could a doubt have come into your head about it governor As the sun goes down I intend to go on said Bradley So much the more necessairy is a Peck returned Riderhood Come in and have it T otherest The formality of spreading a tablecloth not being observed in mister Riderhood s establishment the serving of the peck was the affair of a moment it merely consisting in the handing down of a capacious baking dish with three fourths of an immense meat pie in it and the production of two pocket knives an earthenware mug and a large brown bottle of beer Both ate and drank but Riderhood much the more abundantly In lieu of plates that honest man cut two triangular pieces from the thick crust of the pie and laid them inside uppermost upon the table the one before himself and the other before his guest Upon these platters he placed two goodly portions of the contents of the pie thus imparting the unusual interest to the entertainment that each partaker scooped out the inside of his plate and consumed it with his other fare besides having the sport of pursuing the clots of congealed gravy over the plain of the table and successfully taking them into his mouth at last from the blade of his knife in case of their not first sliding off it Bradley Headstone was so remarkably awkward at these exercises that the Rogue observed it Look out T otherest he cried you ll cut your hand But the caution came too late for Bradley gashed it at the instant And what was more unlucky in asking Riderhood to tie it up and in standing close to him for the purpose he shook his hand under the smart of the wound and shook blood over Riderhood s dress When dinner was done and when what remained of the platters and what remained of the congealed gravy had been put back into what remained of the pie which served as an economical investment for all miscellaneous savings Riderhood filled the mug with beer and took a long drink And now he did look at Bradley and with an evil eye T otherest he said hoarsely as he bent across the table to touch his arm The news has gone down the river afore you What news Who do you think said Riderhood with a hitch of his head as if he disdainfully jerked the feint away picked up the body Guess I am not good at guessing anything She did Hooroar You had him there agin She did The convulsive twitching of Bradley Headstone s face and the sudden hot humour that broke out upon it showed how grimly the intelligence touched him But he said not a single word good or bad He only smiled in a lowering manner and got up and stood leaning at the window looking through it Riderhood followed him with his eyes Riderhood cast down his eyes on his own besprinkled clothes Riderhood began to have an air of being better at a guess than Bradley owned to being I have been so long in want of rest said the schoolmaster that with your leave I ll lie down again And welcome T otherest was the hospitable answer of his host He had laid himself down without waiting for it and he remained upon the bed until the sun was low When he arose and came out to resume his journey he found his host waiting for him on the grass by the towing path outside the door Whenever it may be necessary that you and I should have any further communication together said Bradley I will come back Good night Well since no better can be said Riderhood turning on his heel Good night But he turned again as the other set forth and added under his breath looking after him with a leer You wouldn t be let to go like that if my Relief warn t as good as come I ll catch you up in a mile In a word his real time of relief being that evening at sunset his mate came lounging in within a quarter of an hour Not staying to fill up the utmost margin of his time but borrowing an hour or so to be repaid again when he should relieve his reliever Riderhood straightway followed on the track of Bradley Headstone He was a better follower than Bradley It had been the calling of his life to slink and skulk and dog and waylay and he knew his calling well He effected such a forced march on leaving the Lock House that he was close up with him that is to say as close up with him as he deemed it convenient to be before another Lock was passed His man looked back pretty often as he went but got no hint of him HE knew how to take advantage of the ground and where to put the hedge between them and where the wall and when to duck and when to drop and had a thousand arts beyond the doomed Bradley s slow conception But all his arts were brought to a standstill like himself when Bradley turning into a green lane or riding by the river side a solitary spot run wild in nettles briars and brambles and encumbered with the scathed trunks of a whole hedgerow of felled trees on the outskirts of a little wood began stepping on these trunks and dropping down among them and stepping on them again apparently as a schoolboy might have done but assuredly with no schoolboy purpose or want of purpose What are you up to muttered Riderhood down in the ditch and holding the hedge a little open with both hands And soon his actions made a most extraordinary reply By George and the Draggin cried Riderhood if he ain t a going to bathe He had passed back on and among the trunks of trees again and has passed on to the water side and had begun undressing on the grass For a moment it had a suspicious look of suicide arranged to counterfeit accident But you wouldn t have fetched a bundle under your arm from among that timber if such was your game said Riderhood Nevertheless it was a relief to him when the bather after a plunge and a few strokes came out For I shouldn t he said in a feeling manner have liked to lose you till I had made more money out of you neither Prone in another ditch he had changed his ditch as his man had changed his position and holding apart so small a patch of the hedge that the sharpest eyes could not have detected him Rogue Riderhood watched the bather dressing And now gradually came the wonder that he stood up completely clothed another man and not the Bargeman Aha said Riderhood Much as you was dressed that night I see You re a taking me with you now You re deep But I knows a deeper When the bather had finished dressing he kneeled on the grass doing something with his hands and again stood up with his bundle under his arm Looking all around him with great attention he then went to the river s edge and flung it in as far and yet as lightly as he could It was not until he was so decidedly upon his way again as to be beyond a bend of the river and for the time out of view that Riderhood scrambled from the ditch Now was his debate with himself shall I foller you on or shall I let you loose for this once and go a fishing The debate continuing he followed as a precautionary measure in any case and got him again in sight If I was to let you loose this once said Riderhood then still following I could make you come to me agin or I could find you out in one way or another If I wasn t to go a fishing others might I ll let you loose this once and go a fishing With that he suddenly dropped the pursuit and turned The miserable man whom he had released for the time but not for long went on towards London Bradley was suspicious of every sound he heard and of every face he saw but was under a spell which very commonly falls upon the shedder of blood and had no suspicion of the real danger that lurked in his life and would have it yet Riderhood was much in his thoughts had never been out of his thoughts since the night adventure of their first meeting but Riderhood occupied a very different place there from the place of pursuer and Bradley had been at the pains of devising so many means of fitting that place to him and of wedging him into it that his mind could not compass the possibility of his occupying any other And this is another spell against which the shedder of blood for ever strives in vain There are fifty doors by which discovery may enter With infinite pains and cunning he double locks and bars forty nine of them and cannot see the fiftieth standing wide open Now too was he cursed with a state of mind more wearing and more wearisome than remorse He had no remorse but the evildoer who can hold that avenger at bay cannot escape the slower torture of incessantly doing the evil deed again and doing it more efficiently In the defensive declarations and pretended confessions of murderers the pursuing shadow of this torture may be traced through every lie they tell If I had done it as alleged is it conceivable that I would have made this and this mistake If I had done it as alleged should I have left that unguarded place which that false and wicked witness against me so infamously deposed to The state of that wretch who continually finds the weak spots in his own crime and strives to strengthen them when it is unchangeable is a state that aggravates the offence by doing the deed a thousand times instead of once but it is a state too that tauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen unrepentant nature with its heaviest punishment every time Bradley toiled on chained heavily to the idea of his hatred and his vengeance and thinking how he might have satiated both in many better ways than the way he had taken The instrument might have been better the spot and the hour might have been better chosen To batter a man down from behind in the dark on the brink of a river was well enough but he ought to have been instantly disabled whereas he had turned and seized his assailant and so to end it before chance help came and to be rid of him he had been hurriedly thrown backward into the river before the life was fully beaten out of him Now if it could be done again it must not be so done Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while Supposing the first blow had been truer Supposing he had been shot Supposing he had been strangled Suppose this way that way the other way Suppose anything but getting unchained from the one idea for that was inexorably impossible The school reopened next day The scholars saw little or no change in their master s face for it always wore its slowly labouring expression But as he heard his classes he was always doing the deed and doing it better As he paused with his piece of chalk at the black board before writing on it he was thinking of the spot and whether the water was not deeper and the fall straighter a little higher up or a little lower down He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board and show himself what he meant He was doing it again and improving on the manner at prayers in his mental arithmetic all through his questioning all through the day Charley Hexam was a master now in another school under another head It was evening and Bradley was walking in his garden observed from behind a blind by gentle little Miss Peecher who contemplated offering him a loan of her smelling salts for headache when Mary Anne in faithful attendance held up her arm Yes Mary Anne Young mister Hexam if you please ma am coming to see mister Headstone Very good Mary Anne Again Mary Anne held up her arm You may speak Mary Anne mister Headstone has beckoned young mister Hexam into his house ma am and he has gone in himself without waiting for young mister Hexam to come up and now HE has gone in too ma am and has shut the door With all my heart Mary Anne Again Mary Anne s telegraphic arm worked What more Mary Anne They must find it rather dull and dark Miss Peecher for the parlour blind s down and neither of them pulls it up There is no accounting said good Miss Peecher with a little sad sigh which she repressed by laying her hand on her neat methodical boddice there is no accounting for tastes Mary Anne Charley entering the dark room stopped short when he saw his old friend in its yellow shade Come in Hexam come in Charley advanced to take the hand that was held out to him but stopped again short of it The heavy bloodshot eyes of the schoolmaster rising to his face with an effort met his look of scrutiny mister Headstone what s the matter Matter Where mister Headstone have you heard the news This news about the fellow mister Eugene Wrayburn That he is killed He is dead then exclaimed Bradley Young Hexam standing looking at him he moistened his lips with his tongue looked about the room glanced at his former pupil and looked down I heard of the outrage said Bradley trying to constrain his working mouth but I had not heard the end of it Where were you said the boy advancing a step as he lowered his voice when it was done Stop I don t ask that Don t tell me If you force your confidence upon me mister Headstone I ll give up every word of it Mind Take notice I ll give up it and I ll give up you I will The wretched creature seemed to suffer acutely under this renunciation A desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him like a visible shade It s for me to speak not you said the boy If you do you ll do it at your peril I am going to put your selfishness before you mister Headstone your passionate violent and ungovernable selfishness to show you why I can and why I will have nothing more to do with you He looked at young Hexam as if he were waiting for a scholar to go on with a lesson that he knew by heart and was deadly tired of But he had said his last word to him If you had any part I don t say what in this attack pursued the boy or if you know anything about it I don t say how much or if you know who did it I go no closer you did an injury to me that s never to be forgiven You know that I took you with me to his chambers in the Temple when I told him my opinion of him and made myself responsible for my opinion of you You know that I took you with me when I was watching him with a view to recovering my sister and bringing her to her senses you know that I have allowed myself to be mixed up with you all through this business in favouring your desire to marry my sister And how do you know that pursuing the ends of your own violent temper you have not laid me open to suspicion Is that your gratitude to me mister Headstone Bradley sat looking steadily before him at the vacant air As often as young Hexam stopped he turned his eyes towards him as if he were waiting for him to go on with the lesson and get it done As often as the boy resumed Bradley resumed his fixed face I am going to be plain with you mister Headstone said young Hexam shaking his head in a half threatening manner because this is no time for affecting not to know things that I do know except certain things at which it might not be very safe for you to hint again What I mean is this if you were a good master I was a good pupil I have done you plenty of credit and in improving my own reputation I have improved yours quite as much Very well then Starting on equal terms I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister You have compromised me by being seen about with me endeavouring to counteract this mister Eugene Wrayburn That s the first thing you have done If my character and my now dropping you help me out of that mister Headstone the deliverance is to be attributed to me and not to you No thanks to you for it The boy stopping again he moved his eyes again I am going on mister Headstone don t you be afraid I am going on to the end and I have told you beforehand what the end is Now you know my story You are as well aware as I am that I have had many disadvantages to leave behind me in life You have heard me mention my father and you are sufficiently acquainted with the fact that the home from which I as I may say escaped might have been a more creditable one than it was My father died and then it might have been supposed that my way to respectability was pretty clear No For then my sister begins He spoke as confidently and with as entire an absence of any tell tale colour in his cheek as if there were no softening old time behind him Not wonderful for there WAS none in his hollow empty heart What is there but self for selfishness to see behind it When I speak of my sister I devoutly wish that you had never seen her mister Headstone However you did see her and that s useless now I confided in you about her I explained her character to you and how she interposed some ridiculous fanciful notions in the way of our being as respectable as I tried for You fell in love with her and I favoured you with all my might She could not be induced to favour you and so we came into collision with this mister Eugene Wrayburn Now what have you done Why you have justified my sister in being firmly set against you from first to last and you have put me in the wrong again And why have you done it Because mister Headstone you are in all your passions so selfish and so concentrated upon yourself that you have not bestowed one proper thought on me The cool conviction with which the boy took up and held his position could have been derived from no other vice in human nature It is he went on actually with tears an extraordinary circumstance attendant on my life that every effort I make towards perfect respectability is impeded by somebody else through no fault of mine Not content with doing what I have put before you you will drag my name into notoriety through dragging my sister s which you are pretty sure to do if my suspicions have any foundation at all and the worse you prove to be the harder it will be for me to detach myself from being associated with you in people s minds When he had dried his eyes and heaved a sob over his injuries he began moving towards the door However I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the scale of society and that I will not be dragged down by others I have done with my sister as well as with you Since she cares so little for me as to care nothing for undermining my respectability she shall go her way and I will go mine My prospects are very good and I mean to follow them alone mister Headstone I don t say what you have got upon your conscience for I don t know Whatever lies upon it I hope you will see the justice of keeping wide and clear of me and will find a consolation in completely exonerating all but yourself I hope before many years are out to succeed the master in my present school and the mistress being a single woman though some years older than I am I might even marry her If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out by keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society these are the plans at present occurring to me In conclusion if you feel a sense of having injured me and a desire to make some small reparation I hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and will contemplate your blighted existence Was it strange that the wretched man should take this heavily to heart Perhaps he had taken the boy to heart first through some long laborious years perhaps through the same years he had found his drudgery lightened by communication with a brighter and more apprehensive spirit than his own perhaps a family resemblance of face and voice between the boy and his sister smote him hard in the gloom of his fallen state For whichsoever reason or for all he drooped his devoted head when the boy was gone and shrank together on the floor and grovelled there with the palms of his hands tight clasping his hot temples in unutterable misery and unrelieved by a single tear Rogue Riderhood had been busy with the river that day He had fished with assiduity on the previous evening but the light was short and he had fished unsuccessfully He had fished again that day with better luck and had carried his fish home to Plashwater Weir Mill Lock house in a bundle Chapter eight A FEW GRAINS OF PEPPER The dolls dressmaker went no more to the business premises of Pubsey and company in saint Mary Axe after chance had disclosed to her as she supposed the flinty and hypocritical character of mister Riah She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat but made her little purchases elsewhere and lived a secluded life After much consultation with herself she decided not to put Lizzie Hexam on her guard against the old man arguing that the disappointment of finding him out would come upon her quite soon enough Therefore in her communication with her friend by letter she was silent on this theme and principally dilated on the backslidings of her bad child who every day grew worse and worse You wicked old boy Miss Wren would say to him with a menacing forefinger you ll force me to run away from you after all you will and then you ll shake to bits and there ll be nobody to pick up the pieces At this foreshadowing of a desolate decease the wicked old boy would whine and whimper and would sit shaking himself into the lowest of low spirits until such time as he could shake himself out of the house and shake another threepennyworth into himself But dead drunk or dead sober he had come to such a pass that he was least alive in the latter state it was always on the conscience of the paralytic scarecrow that he had betrayed his sharp parent for sixty threepennyworths of rum which were all gone and that her sharpness would infallibly detect his having done it sooner or later All things considered therefore and addition made of the state of his body to the state of his mind the bed on which mister Dolls reposed was a bed of roses from which the flowers and leaves had entirely faded leaving him to lie upon the thorns and stalks On a certain day Miss Wren was alone at her work with the house door set open for coolness and was trolling in a small sweet voice a mournful little song which might have been the song of the doll she was dressing bemoaning the brittleness and meltability of wax when whom should she descry standing on the pavement looking in at her but mister Fledgeby I thought it was you said Fledgeby coming up the two steps Did you Miss Wren retorted And I thought it was you young man Quite a coincidence You re not mistaken and I m not mistaken How clever we are Well and how are you said Fledgeby I am pretty much as usual sir replied Miss Wren A very unfortunate parent worried out of my life and senses by a very bad child Fledgeby s small eyes opened so wide that they might have passed for ordinary sized eyes as he stared about him for the very young person whom he supposed to be in question But you re not a parent said Miss Wren and consequently it s of no use talking to you upon a family subject To what am I to attribute the honour and favour To a wish to improve your acquaintance mister Fledgeby replied Miss Wren stopping to bite her thread looked at him very knowingly We never meet now said Fledgeby do we No said Miss Wren chopping off the word So I had a mind pursued Fledgeby to come and have a talk with you about our dodging friend the child of Israel So HE gave you my address did he asked Miss Wren I got it out of him said Fledgeby with a stammer You seem to see a good deal of him remarked Miss Wren with shrewd distrust A good deal of him you seem to see considering Yes I do said Fledgeby Considering Haven t you inquired the dressmaker bending over the doll on which her art was being exercised done interceding with him yet No said Fledgeby shaking his head La Been interceding with him all this time and sticking to him still said Miss Wren busy with her work Sticking to him is the word said Fledgeby Miss Wren pursued her occupation with a concentrated air and asked after an interval of silent industry Are you in the army Not exactly said Fledgeby rather flattered by the question Navy asked Miss Wren N no said Fledgeby He qualified these two negatives as if he were not absolutely in either service but was almost in both What are you then demanded Miss Wren I am a gentleman I am said Fledgeby Oh assented Jenny screwing up her mouth with an appearance of conviction Yes to be sure That accounts for your having so much time to give to interceding But only to think how kind and friendly a gentleman you must be mister Fledgeby found that he was skating round a board marked Dangerous and had better cut out a fresh track Let s get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers said he What s he up to in the case of your friend the handsome gal He must have some object What s his object Cannot undertake to say sir I am sure returned Miss Wren composedly He won t acknowledge where she s gone said Fledgeby and I have a fancy that I should like to have another look at her Now I know he knows where she is gone Cannot undertake to say sir I am sure Miss Wren again rejoined And you know where she is gone hazarded Fledgeby Cannot undertake to say sir really replied Miss Wren The quaint little chin met mister Fledgeby s gaze with such a baffling hitch that that agreeable gentleman was for some time at a loss how to resume his fascinating part in the dialogue At length he said Miss Jenny That s your name if I don t mistake Probably you don t mistake sir was Miss Wren s cool answer because you had it on the best authority Mine you know Miss Jenny Instead of coming up and being dead let s come out and look alive It ll pay better I assure you said Fledgeby bestowing an inveigling twinkle or two upon the dressmaker You ll find it pay better Perhaps said Miss Jenny holding out her doll at arm s length and critically contemplating the effect of her art with her scissors on her lips and her head thrown back as if her interest lay there and not in the conversation perhaps you ll explain your meaning young man which is Greek to me You must have another touch of blue in your trimming my dear Having addressed the last remark to her fair client Miss Wren proceeded to snip at some blue fragments that lay before her among fragments of all colours and to thread a needle from a skein of blue silk Look here said Fledgeby Are you attending I am attending sir replied Miss Wren without the slightest appearance of so doing Another touch of blue in your trimming my dear Well look here said Fledgeby rather discouraged by the circumstances under which he found himself pursuing the conversation If you re attending Light blue my sweet young lady remarked Miss Wren in a sprightly tone being best suited to your fair complexion and your flaxen curls I say if you re attending proceeded Fledgeby it ll pay better in this way It ll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and waste of Pubsey and company at a nominal price or even getting it for nothing Aha thought the dressmaker But you are not so roundabout Little Eyes that I don t notice your answering for Pubsey and company after all Little Eyes Little Eyes you re too cunning by half And I take it for granted pursued Fledgeby that to get the most of your materials for nothing would be well worth your while Miss Jenny You may take it for granted returned the dressmaker with many knowing nods that it s always well worth my while to make money Now said Fledgeby approvingly you re answering to a sensible purpose Now you re coming out and looking alive So I make so free Miss Jenny as to offer the remark that you and Judah were too thick together to last You can t come to be intimate with such a deep file as Judah without beginning to see a little way into him you know said Fledgeby with a wink I must own returned the dressmaker with her eyes upon her work that we are not good friends at present I know you re not good friends at present said Fledgeby I know all about it I should like to pay off Judah by not letting him have his own deep way in everything In most things he ll get it by hook or by crook but hang it all don t let him have his own deep way in everything That s too much mister Fledgeby said this with some display of indignant warmth as if he was counsel in the cause for Virtue How can I prevent his having his own way began the dressmaker Deep way I called it said Fledgeby His own deep way in anything I ll tell you said Fledgeby I like to hear you ask it because it s looking alive It s what I should expect to find in one of your sagacious understanding Now candidly Eh cried Miss Jenny I said now candidly mister Fledgeby explained a little put out Oh h I should be glad to countermine him respecting the handsome gal your friend He means something there You may depend upon it Judah means something there He has a motive and of course his motive is a dark motive Now whatever his motive is it s necessary to his motive mister Fledgeby s constructive powers were not equal to the avoidance of some tautology here that it should be kept from me what he has done with her So I put it to you who know What HAS he done with her I ask no more And is that asking much when you understand that it will pay Miss Jenny Wren who had cast her eyes upon the bench again after her last interruption sat looking at it needle in hand but not working for some moments She then briskly resumed her work and said with a sidelong glance of her eyes and chin at mister Fledgeby Where d ye live Albany Piccadilly replied Fledgeby When are you at home When you like Breakfast time said Jenny in her abruptest and shortest manner No better time in the day said Fledgeby I ll look in upon you to morrow young man Those two ladies pointing to dolls have an appointment in Bond Street at ten precisely When I ve dropped em there I ll drive round to you With a weird little laugh Miss Jenny pointed to her crutch stick as her equipage This is looking alive indeed cried Fledgeby rising Mark you I promise you nothing said the dolls dressmaker dabbing two dabs at him with her needle as if she put out both his eyes No no I understand returned Fledgeby The damage and waste question shall be settled first It shall be made to pay don t you be afraid Good day Miss Jenny Good day young man mister Fledgeby s prepossessing form withdrew itself and the little dressmaker clipping and snipping and stitching and stitching and snipping and clipping fell to work at a great rate musing and muttering all the time Misty misty misty Can t make it out Little Eyes and the wolf in a conspiracy Or Little Eyes and the wolf against one another Can t make it out My poor Lizzie have they both designs against you either way Can t make it out Is Little Eyes Pubsey and the wolf company Can t make it out Pubsey true to company and company to Pubsey Pubsey false to company and company to Pubsey Can t make it out What said Little Eyes Now candidly Ah However the cat jumps HE S a liar That s all I can make out at present but you may go to bed in the Albany Piccadilly with THAT for your pillow young man Thereupon the little dressmaker again dabbed out his eyes separately and making a loop in the air of her thread and deftly catching it into a knot with her needle seemed to bowstring him into the bargain For the terrors undergone by mister Dolls that evening when his little parent sat profoundly meditating over her work and when he imagined himself found out as often as she changed her attitude or turned her eyes towards him there is no adequate name Moreover it was her habit to shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook What are popularly called the trembles being in full force upon him that evening and likewise what are popularly called the horrors he had a very bad time of it which was not made better by his being so remorseful as frequently to moan Sixty threepennorths This imperfect sentence not being at all intelligible as a confession but sounding like a Gargantuan order for a dram brought him into new difficulties by occasioning his parent to pounce at him in a more than usually snappish manner and to overwhelm him with bitter reproaches What was a bad time for mister Dolls could not fail to be a bad time for the dolls dressmaker However she was on the alert next morning and drove to Bond Street and set down the two ladies punctually and then directed her equipage to conduct her to the Albany Arrived at the doorway of the house in which mister Fledgeby s chambers were she found a lady standing there in a travelling dress holding in her hand of all things in the world a gentleman s hat You want some one said the lady in a stern manner I am going up stairs to mister Fledgeby s You cannot do that at this moment There is a gentleman with him I am waiting for the gentleman His business with mister Fledgeby will very soon be transacted and then you can go up Until the gentleman comes down you must wait here While speaking and afterwards the lady kept watchfully between her and the staircase as if prepared to oppose her going up by force The lady being of a stature to stop her with a hand and looking mightily determined the dressmaker stood still Well Why do you listen asked the lady I am not listening said the dressmaker What do you hear asked the lady altering her phrase Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere said the dressmaker with an inquiring look mister Fledgeby in his shower bath perhaps remarked the lady smiling And somebody s beating a carpet I think mister Fledgeby s carpet I dare say replied the smiling lady Miss Wren had a reasonably good eye for smiles being well accustomed to them on the part of her young friends though their smiles mostly ran smaller than in nature But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady s face It twitched her nostrils open in a remarkable manner and contracted her lips and eyebrows It was a smile of enjoyment too though of such a fierce kind that Miss Wren thought she would rather not enjoy herself than do it in that way Well said the lady watching her What now I hope there s nothing the matter said the dressmaker Where inquired the lady I don t know where said Miss Wren staring about her But I never heard such odd noises Don t you think I had better call somebody I think you had better not returned the lady with a significant frown and drawing closer On this hint the dressmaker relinquished the idea and stood looking at the lady as hard as the lady looked at her Meanwhile the dressmaker listened with amazement to the odd noises which still continued and the lady listened too but with a coolness in which there was no trace of amazement Soon afterwards came a slamming and banging of doors and then came running down stairs a gentleman with whiskers and out of breath who seemed to be red hot Is your business done Alfred inquired the lady Very thoroughly done replied the gentleman as he took his hat from her You can go up to mister Fledgeby as soon as you like said the lady moving haughtily away Oh And you can take these three pieces of stick with you added the gentleman politely and say if you please that they come from mister Alfred Lammle with his compliments on leaving England mister Alfred Lammle Be so good as not to forget the name The three pieces of stick were three broken and frayed fragments of a stout lithe cane Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly and the gentleman repeating with a grin mister Alfred Lammle if you ll be so good Compliments on leaving England the lady and gentleman walked away quite deliberately and Miss Jenny and her crutch stick went up stairs Lammle Lammle Lammle Miss Jenny repeated as she panted from stair to stair where have I heard that name Lammle Lammle I know Saint Mary Axe With a gleam of new intelligence in her sharp face the dolls dressmaker pulled at Fledgeby s bell No one answered but from within the chambers there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly singular and unintelligible nature Good gracious Is Little Eyes choking cried Miss Jenny Pulling at the bell again and getting no reply she pushed the outer door and found it standing ajar No one being visible on her opening it wider and the spluttering continuing she took the liberty of opening an inner door and then beheld the extraordinary spectacle of mister Fledgeby in a shirt a pair of Turkish trousers and a Turkish cap rolling over and over on his own carpet and spluttering wonderfully Oh Lord gasped mister Fledgeby Oh my eye Stop thief I am strangling Fire Oh my eye A glass of water Give me a glass of water Shut the door Murder Oh Lord And then rolled and spluttered more than ever Hurrying into another room Miss Jenny got a glass of water and brought it for Fledgeby s relief who gasping spluttering and rattling in his throat betweenwhiles drank some water and laid his head faintly on her arm Oh my eye cried Fledgeby struggling anew It s salt and snuff It s up my nose and down my throat and in my wind pipe Ugh Ow Ow Ow Ah h h h And here crowing fearfully with his eyes starting out of his head appeared to be contending with every mortal disease incidental to poultry And Oh my Eye I m so sore cried Fledgeby starting over on his back in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall Oh I smart so Do put something to my back and arms and legs and shoulders Ugh It s down my throat again and can t come up Ow Ow Ow Ah h h h Oh I smart so Here mister Fledgeby bounded up and bounded down and went rolling over and over again The dolls dressmaker looked on until he rolled himself into a corner with his Turkish slippers uppermost and then resolving in the first place to address her ministration to the salt and snuff gave him more water and slapped his back But the latter application was by no means a success causing mister Fledgeby to scream and to cry out Oh my eye don t slap me I m covered with weales and I smart so However he gradually ceased to choke and crow saving at intervals and Miss Jenny got him into an easy chair where with his eyes red and watery with his features swollen and with some half dozen livid bars across his face he presented a most rueful sight What ever possessed you to take salt and snuff young man inquired Miss Jenny I didn t take it the dismal youth replied It was crammed into my mouth Who crammed it asked Miss Jenny He did answered Fledgeby The assassin Lammle He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat Ow Ow Ow Ah h h h Ugh to prevent my crying out and then cruelly assaulted me With this asked Miss Jenny showing the pieces of cane That s the weapon said Fledgeby eyeing it with the air of an acquaintance He broke it over me Oh I smart so How did you come by it When he ran down stairs and joined the lady he had left in the hall with his hat Miss Jenny began Oh groaned mister Fledgeby writhing she was holding his hat was she I might have known she was in it When he came down stairs and joined the lady who wouldn t let me come up he gave me the pieces for you and I was to say With mister Alfred Lammle s compliments on his leaving England Miss Jenny said it with such spiteful satisfaction and such a hitch of her chin and eyes as might have added to mister Fledgeby s miseries if he could have noticed either in his bodily pain with his hand to his head Shall I go for the police inquired Miss Jenny with a nimble start towards the door Stop No don t cried Fledgeby Don t please We had better keep it quiet Will you be so good as shut the door Oh I do smart so In testimony of the extent to which he smarted mister Fledgeby came wallowing out of the easy chair and took another roll on the carpet Now the door s shut said mister Fledgeby sitting up in anguish with his Turkish cap half on and half off and the bars on his face getting bluer do me the kindness to look at my back and shoulders They must be in an awful state for I hadn t got my dressing gown on when the brute came rushing in Cut my shirt away from the collar there s a pair of scissors on that table Oh groaned mister Fledgeby with his hand to his head again How I do smart to be sure There inquired Miss Jenny alluding to the back and shoulders Oh Lord yes moaned Fledgeby rocking himself And all over Everywhere The busy little dressmaker quickly snipped the shirt away and laid bare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as even mister Fledgeby merited You may well smart young man exclaimed Miss Jenny And stealthily rubbed her little hands behind him and poked a few exultant pokes with her two forefingers over the crown of his head What do you think of vinegar and brown paper inquired the suffering Fledgeby still rocking and moaning Does it look as if vinegar and brown paper was the sort of application Yes said Miss Jenny with a silent chuckle It looks as if it ought to be Pickled mister Fledgeby collapsed under the word Pickled and groaned again My kitchen is on this floor he said you ll find brown paper in a dresser drawer there and a bottle of vinegar on a shelf Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put em on It can t be kept too quiet One two hum five six You ll want six said the dress maker There s smart enough whimpered mister Fledgeby groaning and writhing again for sixty Miss Jenny repaired to the kitchen scissors in hand found the brown paper and found the vinegar and skilfully cut out and steeped six large plasters When they were all lying ready on the dresser an idea occurred to her as she was about to gather them up I think said Miss Jenny with a silent laugh he ought to have a little pepper Just a few grains I think the young man s tricks and manners make a claim upon his friends for a little pepper mister Fledgeby s evil star showing her the pepper box on the chimneypiece she climbed upon a chair and got it down and sprinkled all the plasters with a judicious hand She then went back to mister Fledgeby and stuck them all on him mister Fledgeby uttering a sharp howl as each was put in its place There young man said the dolls dressmaker Now I hope you feel pretty comfortable Apparently mister Fledgeby did not for he cried by way of answer Oh h how I do smart Miss Jenny got his Persian gown upon him extinguished his eyes crookedly with his Persian cap and helped him to his bed upon which he climbed groaning Business between you and me being out of the question to day young man and my time being precious said Miss Jenny then I ll make myself scarce Are you comfortable now Oh my eye cried mister Fledgeby No I ain t Oh h h how I do smart The last thing Miss Jenny saw as she looked back before closing the room door was mister Fledgeby in the act of plunging and gambolling all over his bed like a porpoise or dolphin in its native element She then shut the bedroom door and all the other doors and going down stairs and emerging from the Albany into the busy streets took omnibus for Saint Mary Axe pressing on the road all the gaily dressed ladies whom she could see from the window and making them unconscious lay figures for dolls while she mentally cut them out and basted them Chapter nine TWO PLACES VACATED Set down by the omnibus at the corner of Saint Mary Axe and trusting to her feet and her crutch stick within its precincts the dolls dressmaker proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and company All there was sunny and quiet externally and shady and quiet internally Hiding herself in the entry outside the glass door she could see from that post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing at his desk Boh cried the dressmaker popping in her head at the glass door mister Wolf at home The old man took his glasses off and mildly laid them down beside him Ah Jenny is it you I thought you had given me up And so I had given up the treacherous wolf of the forest she replied but godmother it strikes me you have come back I am not quite sure because the wolf and you change forms I want to ask you a question or two to find out whether you are really godmother or really wolf May I Yes Jenny yes But Riah glanced towards the door as if he thought his principal might appear there unseasonably If you re afraid of the fox said Miss Jenny you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal HE won t show himself abroad for many a day What do you mean my child I mean godmother replied Miss Wren sitting down beside the Jew that the fox has caught a famous flogging and that if his skin and bones are not tingling aching and smarting at this present instant no fox did ever tingle ache and smart Therewith Miss Jenny related what had come to pass in the Albany omitting the few grains of pepper Now godmother she went on I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here since I left the wolf here Because I have an idea about the size of a marble rolling about in my little noddle First and foremost are you Pubsey and company or are you either Upon your solemn word and honour The old man shook his head Secondly isn t Fledgeby both Pubsey and company The old man answered with a reluctant nod My idea exclaimed Miss Wren is now about the size of an orange But before it gets any bigger welcome back dear godmother The little creature folded her arms about the old man s neck with great earnestness and kissed him I humbly beg your forgiveness godmother I am truly sorry I ought to have had more faith in you But what could I suppose when you said nothing for yourself you know I don t mean to offer that as a justification but what could I suppose when you were a silent party to all he said It did look bad now didn t it It looked so bad Jenny responded the old man with gravity that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me I was hateful in mine own eyes I was hateful to myself in being so hateful to the debtor and to you But more than that and worse than that and to pass out far and broad beyond myself I reflected that evening sitting alone in my garden on the housetop that I was doing dishonour to my ancient faith and race I reflected clearly reflected for the first time that in bending my neck to the yoke I was willing to wear I bent the unwilling necks of the whole Jewish people For it is not in Christian countries with the Jews as with other peoples Men say This is a bad Greek but there are good Greeks This is a bad Turk but there are good Turks Not so with the Jews Men find the bad among us easily enough among what peoples are the bad not easily found but they take the worst of us as samples of the best they take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest and they say All Jews are alike If doing what I was content to do here because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now I had been a Christian I could have done it compromising no one but my individual self But doing it as a Jew I could not choose but compromise the Jews of all conditions and all countries It is a little hard upon us but it is the truth I would that all our people remembered it Though I have little right to say so seeing that it came home so late to me The dolls dressmaker sat holding the old man by the hand and looking thoughtfully in his face Thus I reflected I say sitting that evening in my garden on the housetop And passing the painful scene of that day in review before me many times I always saw that the poor gentleman believed the story readily because I was one of the Jews that you believed the story readily my child because I was one of the Jews that the story itself first came into the invention of the originator thereof because I was one of the Jews This was the result of my having had you three before me face to face and seeing the thing visibly presented as upon a theatre Wherefore I perceived that the obligation was upon me to leave this service But Jenny my dear said Riah breaking off I promised that you should pursue your questions and I obstruct them On the contrary godmother my idea is as large now as a pumpkin and YOU know what a pumpkin is don t you So you gave notice that you were going Does that come next asked Miss Jenny with a look of close attention I indited a letter to my master Yes To that effect And what said Tingling Tossing Aching Screaming Scratching Smarter asked Miss Wren with an unspeakable enjoyment in the utterance of those honourable titles and in the recollection of the pepper He held me to certain months of servitude which were his lawful term of notice They expire to morrow Upon their expiration not before I had meant to set myself right with my Cinderella My idea is getting so immense now cried Miss Wren clasping her temples that my head won t hold it Listen godmother I am going to expound Little Eyes that s Screaming Scratching Smarter owes you a heavy grudge for going Little Eyes casts about how best to pay you off Little Eyes thinks of Lizzie Little Eyes says to himself I ll find out where he has placed that girl and I ll betray his secret because it s dear to him Perhaps Little Eyes thinks I ll make love to her myself too but that I can t swear all the rest I can So Little Eyes comes to me and I go to Little Eyes That s the way of it And now the murder s all out I m sorry added the dolls dressmaker rigid from head to foot with energy as she shook her little fist before her eyes that I didn t give him Cayenne pepper and chopped pickled Capsicum This expression of regret being but partially intelligible to mister Riah the old man reverted to the injuries Fledgeby had received and hinted at the necessity of his at once going to tend that beaten cur Godmother godmother godmother cried Miss Wren irritably I really lose all patience with you One would think you believed in the Good Samaritan How can you be so inconsistent Jenny dear began the old man gently it is the custom of our people to help Oh Bother your people interposed Miss Wren with a toss of her head If your people don t know better than to go and help Little Eyes it s a pity they ever got out of Egypt Over and above that she added he wouldn t take your help if you offered it Too much ashamed Wants to keep it close and quiet and to keep you out of the way They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed Riah To which he said there was an answer wanted The letter which was scrawled in pencil uphill and downhill and round crooked corners ran thus OLD RIAH Your accounts being all squared go Shut up the place turn out directly and send me the key by bearer Go You are an unthankful dog of a Jew Get out F The dolls dressmaker found it delicious to trace the screaming and smarting of Little Eyes in the distorted writing of this epistle She laughed over it and jeered at it in a convenient corner to the great astonishment of the messenger while the old man got his few goods together in a black bag That done the shutters of the upper windows closed and the office blind pulled down they issued forth upon the steps with the attendant messenger There while Miss Jenny held the bag the old man locked the house door and handed over the key to him who at once retired with the same Well godmother said Miss Wren as they remained upon the steps together looking at one another And so you re thrown upon the world It would appear so Jenny and somewhat suddenly Where are you going to seek your fortune asked Miss Wren The old man smiled but looked about him with a look of having lost his way in life which did not escape the dolls dressmaker Verily Jenny said he the question is to the purpose and more easily asked than answered But as I have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to Lizzie I think I will seek them out for myself On foot asked Miss Wren with a chop Ay said the old man Have I not my staff It was exactly because he had his staff and presented so quaint an aspect that she mistrusted his making the journey The best thing you can do said Jenny for the time being at all events is to come home with me godmother Nobody s there but my bad child and Lizzie s lodging stands empty The old man when satisfied that no inconvenience could be entailed on any one by his compliance readily complied and the singularly assorted couple once more went through the streets together Now the bad child having been strictly charged by his parent to remain at home in her absence of course went out and being in the very last stage of mental decrepitude went out with two objects firstly to establish a claim he conceived himself to have upon any licensed victualler living to be supplied with threepennyworth of rum for nothing and secondly to bestow some maudlin remorse on mister Eugene Wrayburn and see what profit came of it Stumblingly pursuing these two designs they both meant rum the only meaning of which he was capable the degraded creature staggered into Covent Garden Market and there bivouacked to have an attack of the trembles succeeded by an attack of the horrors in a doorway This market of Covent Garden was quite out of the creature s line of road but it had the attraction for him which it has for the worst of the solitary members of the drunken tribe It may be the companionship of the nightly stir or it may be the companionship of the gin and beer that slop about among carters and hucksters or it may be the companionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like their own dress that perhaps they take the Market for a great wardrobe but be it what it may you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps anywhere as there Of dozing women drunkards especially you shall come upon such specimens there in the morning sunlight as you might seek out of doors in vain through London Such stale vapid rejected cabbage leaf and cabbage stalk dress such damaged orange countenance such squashed pulp of humanity are open to the day nowhere else So the attraction of the Market drew mister Dolls to it and he had out his two fits of trembles and horrors in a doorway on which a woman had had out her sodden nap a few hours before There is a swarm of young savages always flitting about this same place creeping off with fragments of orange chests and mouldy litter Heaven knows into what holes they can convey them having no home whose bare feet fall with a blunt dull softness on the pavement as the policeman hunts them and who are perhaps for that reason little heard by the Powers that be whereas in top boots they would make a deafening clatter These delighting in the trembles and the horrors of mister Dolls as in a gratuitous drama flocked about him in his doorway butted at him leaped at him and pelted him Hence when he came out of his invalid retirement and shook off that ragged train he was much bespattered and in worse case than ever But not yet at his worst for going into a public house and being supplied in stress of business with his rum and seeking to vanish without payment he was collared searched found penniless and admonished not to try that again by having a pail of dirty water cast over him This application superinduced another fit of the trembles after which mister Dolls as finding himself in good cue for making a call on a professional friend addressed himself to the Temple There was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight That discreet youth sensible of a certain incongruity in the association of such a client with the business that might be coming some day with the best intentions temporized with Dolls and offered a shilling for coach hire home mister Dolls accepting the shilling promptly laid it out in two threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life and two threepennyworths of raging repentance Returning to the Chambers with which burden he was descried coming round into the court by the wary young Blight watching from the window who instantly closed the outer door and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels The more the door resisted him the more dangerous and imminent became that bloody conspiracy against his life Force of police arriving he recognized in them the conspirators and laid about him hoarsely fiercely staringly convulsively foamingly A humble machine familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of Stretcher being unavoidably sent for he was rendered a harmless bundle of torn rags by being strapped down upon it with voice and consciousness gone out of him and life fast going As this machine was borne out at the Temple gate by four men the poor little dolls dressmaker and her Jewish friend were coming up the street Let us see what it is cried the dressmaker Let us make haste and look godmother The brisk little crutch stick was but too brisk O gentlemen gentlemen he belongs to me Belongs to you said the head of the party stopping it O yes dear gentlemen he s my child out without leave My poor bad bad boy and he don t know me he don t know me O what shall I do cried the little creature wildly beating her hands together when my own child don t know me The head of the party looked as well he might to the old man for explanation He whispered as the dolls dressmaker bent over the exhausted form and vainly tried to extract some sign of recognition from it It s her drunken father As the load was put down in the street Riah drew the head of the party aside and whispered that he thought the man was dying No surely not returned the other But he became less confident on looking and directed the bearers to bring him to the nearest doctor s shop Thither he was brought the window becoming from within a wall of faces deformed into all kinds of shapes through the agency of globular red bottles green bottles blue bottles and other coloured bottles A ghastly light shining upon him that he didn t need the beast so furious but a few minutes gone was quiet enough now with a strange mysterious writing on his face reflected from one of the great bottles as if Death had marked him Mine The medical testimony was more precise and more to the purpose than it sometimes is in a Court of Justice You had better send for something to cover it All s over Therefore the police sent for something to cover it and it was covered and borne through the streets the people falling away After it went the dolls dressmaker hiding her face in the Jewish skirts and clinging to them with one hand while with the other she plied her stick It was carried home and by reason that the staircase was very narrow it was put down in the parlour the little working bench being set aside to make room for it and there in the midst of the dolls with no speculation in their eyes lay mister Dolls with no speculation in his Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed before the money was in the dressmaker s pocket to get mourning for mister Dolls As the old man Riah sat by helping her in such small ways as he could he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father If my poor boy she would say had been brought up better he might have done better Not that I reproach myself I hope I have no cause for that None indeed Jenny I am very certain Thank you godmother It cheers me to hear you say so But you see it is so hard to bring up a child well when you work work work all day When he was out of employment I couldn t always keep him near me He got fractious and nervous and I was obliged to let him go into the streets And he never did well in the streets he never did well out of sight How often it happens with children Too often even in this sad sense thought the old man How can I say what I might have turned out myself but for my back having been so bad and my legs so queer when I was young the dressmaker would go on I had nothing to do but work and so I worked I couldn t play But my poor unfortunate child could play and it turned out the worse for him And not for him alone Jenny Well I don t know godmother He suffered heavily did my unfortunate boy He was very very ill sometimes And I called him a quantity of names shaking her head over her work and dropping tears I don t know that his going wrong was much the worse for me If it ever was let us forget it You are a good girl you are a patient girl As for patience she would reply with a shrug not much of that godmother If I had been patient I should never have called him names But I hope I did it for his good And besides I felt my responsibility as a mother so much I tried reasoning and reasoning failed I tried coaxing and coaxing failed I tried scolding and scolding failed But I was bound to try everything you know with such a charge upon my hands Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy if I had not tried everything With such talk mostly in a cheerful tone on the part of the industrious little creature the day work and the night work were beguiled until enough of smart dolls had gone forth to bring into the kitchen where the working bench now stood the sombre stuff that the occasion required and to bring into the house the other sombre preparations And now said Miss Jenny having knocked off my rosy cheeked young friends I ll knock off my white cheeked self This referred to her making her own dress which at last was done The disadvantage of making for yourself said Miss Jenny as she stood upon a chair to look at the result in the glass is that you can t charge anybody else for the job and the advantage is that you haven t to go out to try on Humph Very fair indeed If He could see me now whoever he is I hope he wouldn t repent of his bargain The simple arrangements were of her own making and were stated to Riah thus I mean to go alone godmother in my usual carriage and you ll be so kind as keep house while I am gone It s not far off And when I return we ll have a cup of tea and a chat over future arrangements It s a very plain last house that I have been able to give my poor unfortunate boy but he ll accept the will for the deed if he knows anything about it and if he doesn t know anything about it with a sob and wiping her eyes why it won t matter to him I see the service in the Prayer book says that we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can take nothing out It comforts me for not being able to hire a lot of stupid undertaker s things for my poor child and seeming as if I was trying to smuggle em out of this world with him when of course I must break down in the attempt and bring em all back again As it is there ll be nothing to bring back but me and that s quite consistent for I shan t be brought back some day After that previous carrying of him in the streets the wretched old fellow seemed to be twice buried He was taken on the shoulders of half a dozen blossom faced men who shuffled with him to the churchyard and who were preceded by another blossom faced man affecting a stately stalk as if he were a Policeman of the D eath Division and ceremoniously pretending not to know his intimate acquaintances as he led the pageant Yet the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling after caused many people to turn their heads with a look of interest At last the troublesome deceased was got into the ground to be buried no more and the stately stalker stalked back before the solitary dressmaker as if she were bound in honour to have no notion of the way home Those Furies the conventionalities being thus appeased he left her I must have a very short cry godmother before I cheer up for good said the little creature coming in Because after all a child is a child you know It was a longer cry than might have been expected Howbeit it wore itself out in a shadowy corner and then the dressmaker came forth and washed her face and made the tea You wouldn t mind my cutting out something while we are at tea would you she asked her Jewish friend with a coaxing air Cinderella dear child the old man expostulated will you never rest Oh It s not work cutting out a pattern isn t said Miss Jenny with her busy little scissors already snipping at some paper The truth is godmother I want to fix it while I have it correct in my mind Have you seen it to day then asked Riah Yes godmother Saw it just now It s a surplice that s what it is Thing our clergymen wear you know explained Miss Jenny in consideration of his professing another faith And what have you to do with that Jenny Why godmother replied the dressmaker you must know that we Professors who live upon our taste and invention are obliged to keep our eyes always open And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now So it came into my head while I was weeping at my poor boy s grave that something in my way might be done with a clergyman What can be done asked the old man Not a funeral never fear returned Miss Jenny anticipating his objection with a nod The public don t like to be made melancholy I know very well I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning not into real mourning that is Court mourning they are rather proud of But a doll clergyman my dear glossy black curls and whiskers uniting two of my young friends in matrimony said Miss Jenny shaking her forefinger is quite another affair If you don t see those three at the altar in Bond Street in a jiffy my name s Jack Robinson With her expert little ways in sharp action she had got a doll into whitey brown paper orders before the meal was over and was displaying it for the edification of the Jewish mind when a knock was heard at the street door Riah went to open it and presently came back ushering in with the grave and courteous air that sat so well upon him a gentleman The gentleman was a stranger to the dressmaker but even in the moment of his casting his eyes upon her there was something in his manner which brought to her remembrance mister Eugene Wrayburn Pardon me said the gentleman You are the dolls dressmaker I am the dolls dressmaker sir Lizzie Hexam s friend Yes sir replied Miss Jenny instantly on the defensive And Lizzie Hexam s friend Here is a note from her entreating you to accede to the request of mister Mortimer Lightwood the bearer mister Riah chances to know that I am mister Mortimer Lightwood and will tell you so Riah bent his head in corroboration Will you read the note It s very short said Jenny with a look of wonder when she had read it There was no time to make it longer Time was so very precious My dear friend mister Eugene Wrayburn is dying The dressmaker clasped her hands and uttered a little piteous cry Is dying repeated Lightwood with emotion at some distance from here He is sinking under injuries received at the hands of a villain who attacked him in the dark I come straight from his bedside He is almost always insensible In a short restless interval of sensibility or partial sensibility I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made I caused Lizzie to hear them We were both sure that he asked for you The dressmaker with her hands still clasped looked affrightedly from the one to the other of her two companions If you delay he may die with his request ungratified with his last wish intrusted to me we have long been much more than brothers unfulfilled I shall break down if I try to say more In a few moments the black bonnet and the crutch stick were on duty the good Jew was left in possession of the house and the dolls dressmaker side by side in a chaise with Mortimer Lightwood was posting out of town Chapter ten THE DOLLS DRESSMAKER DISCOVERS A WORD A darkened and hushed room the river outside the windows flowing on to the vast ocean a figure on the bed swathed and bandaged and bound lying helpless on its back with its two useless arms in splints at its sides Only two days of usage so familiarized the little dressmaker with this scene that it held the place occupied two days ago by the recollections of years He had scarcely moved since her arrival Sometimes his eyes were open sometimes closed When they were open there was no meaning in their unwinking stare at one spot straight before them unless for a moment the brow knitted into a faint expression of anger or surprise Then Mortimer Lightwood would speak to him and on occasions he would be so far roused as to make an attempt to pronounce his friend s name But in an instant consciousness was gone again and no spirit of Eugene was in Eugene s crushed outer form They provided Jenny with materials for plying her work and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed Sitting there with her rich shower of hair falling over the chair back they hoped she might attract his notice With the same object she would sing just above her breath when he opened his eyes or she saw his brow knit into that faint expression so evanescent that it was like a shape made in water But as yet he had not heeded The they here mentioned were the medical attendant Lizzie who was there in all her intervals of rest and Lightwood who never left him The two days became three and the three days became four At length quite unexpectedly he said something in a whisper What was it my dear Eugene Will you Mortimer Will I Send for her My dear fellow she is here Quite unconscious of the long blank he supposed that they were still speaking together The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed humming her song and nodded to him brightly I can t shake hands Jenny said Eugene with something of his old look but I am very glad to see you Mortimer repeated this to her for it could only be made out by bending over him and closely watching his attempts to say it In a little while he added Ask her if she has seen the children Mortimer could not understand this neither could Jenny herself until he added Ask her if she has smelt the flowers Oh I know cried Jenny I understand him now Then Lightwood yielded his place to her quick approach and she said bending over the bed with that better look You mean my long bright slanting rows of children who used to bring me ease and rest You mean the children who used to take me up and make me light Eugene smiled Yes I have not seen them since I saw you I never see them now but I am hardly ever in pain now It was a pretty fancy said Eugene But I have heard my birds sing cried the little creature and I have smelt my flowers Yes indeed I have And both were most beautiful and most Divine Stay and help to nurse me said Eugene quietly I should like you to have the fancy here before I die She touched his lips with her hand and shaded her eyes with that same hand as she went back to her work and her little low song He heard the song with evident pleasure until she allowed it gradually to sink away into silence Mortimer My dear Eugene If you can give me anything to keep me here for only a few minutes To keep you here Eugene To prevent my wandering away I don t know where for I begin to be sensible that I have just come back and that I shall lose myself again do so dear boy Mortimer gave him such stimulants as could be given him with safety they were always at hand ready and bending over him once more was about to caution him when he said Don t tell me not to speak for I must speak If you knew the harassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those places where are those endless places Mortimer They must be at an immense distance He saw in his friend s face that he was losing himself for he added after a moment Don t be afraid I am not gone yet What was it You wanted to tell me something Eugene My poor dear fellow you wanted to say something to your old friend to the friend who has always loved you admired you imitated you founded himself upon you been nothing without you and who God knows would be here in your place if he could Tut tut said Eugene with a tender glance as the other put his hand before his face I am not worth it I acknowledge that I like it dear boy but I am not worth it This attack my dear Mortimer this murder His friend leaned over him with renewed attention saying You and I suspect some one More than suspect But Mortimer while I lie here and when I lie here no longer I trust to you that the perpetrator is never brought to justice Eugene Her innocent reputation would be ruined my friend She would be punished not he I have wronged her enough in fact I have wronged her still more in intention You recollect what pavement is said to be made of good intentions It is made of bad intentions too Mortimer I am lying on it and I know Be comforted my dear Eugene I will when you have promised me Dear Mortimer the man must never be pursued If he should be accused you must keep him silent and save him Don t think of avenging me think only of hushing the story and protecting her You can confuse the case and turn aside the circumstances Listen to what I say to you It was not the schoolmaster Bradley Headstone Do you hear me Twice it was not the schoolmaster Bradley Headstone Do you hear me Three times it was not the schoolmaster Bradley Headstone He stopped exhausted His speech had been whispered broken and indistinct but by a great effort he had made it plain enough to be unmistakeable Dear fellow I am wandering away Stay me for another moment if you can Lightwood lifted his head at the neck and put a wine glass to his lips He rallied I don t know how long ago it was done whether weeks days or hours No matter There is inquiry on foot and pursuit Say Is there not Yes Check it divert it Don t let her be brought in question Shield her The guilty man brought to justice would poison her name Let the guilty man go unpunished Lizzie and my reparation before all Promise me Eugene I do I promise you In the act of turning his eyes gratefully towards his friend he wandered away His eyes stood still and settled into that former intent unmeaning stare Hours and hours days and nights he remained in this same condition There were times when he would calmly speak to his friend after a long period of unconsciousness and would say he was better and would ask for something Before it could be given him he would be gone again The dolls dressmaker all softened compassion now watched him with an earnestness that never relaxed She would regularly change the ice or the cooling spirit on his head and would keep her ear at the pillow betweenwhiles listening for any faint words that fell from him in his wanderings It was amazing through how many hours at a time she would remain beside him in a crouching attitude attentive to his slightest moan As he could not move a hand he could make no sign of distress but through this close watching if through no secret sympathy or power the little creature attained an understanding of him that Lightwood did not possess Mortimer would often turn to her as if she were an interpreter between this sentient world and the insensible man and she would change the dressing of a wound or ease a ligature or turn his face or alter the pressure of the bedclothes on him with an absolute certainty of doing right The natural lightness and delicacy of touch which had become very refined by practice in her miniature work no doubt was involved in this but her perception was at least as fine The one word Lizzie he muttered millions of times In a certain phase of his distressful state which was the worst to those who tended him he would roll his head upon the pillow incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and impatient manner with the misery of a disturbed mind and the monotony of a machine Equally when he lay still and staring he would repeat it for hours without cessation but then always in a tone of subdued warning and horror Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face would often stop this and then they learned to expect that he would for some time remain still with his eyes closed and that he would be conscious on opening them But the heavy disappointment of their hope revived by the welcome silence of the room was that his spirit would glide away again and be lost in the moment of their joy that it was there This frequent rising of a drowning man from the deep to sink again was dreadful to the beholders But gradually the change stole upon him that it became dreadful to himself His desire to impart something that was on his mind his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend and make a communication to him so troubled him when he recovered consciousness that its term was thereby shortened As the man rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water so he in his desperate struggle went down again One afternoon when he had been lying still and Lizzie unrecognized had just stolen out of the room to pursue her occupation he uttered Lightwood s name My dear Eugene I am here How long is this to last Mortimer Lightwood shook his head Still Eugene you are no worse than you were But I know there s no hope Yet I pray it may last long enough for you to do me one last service and for me to do one last action Keep me here a few moments Mortimer Try try His friend gave him what aid he could and encouraged him to believe that he was more composed though even then his eyes were losing the expression they so rarely recovered Hold me here dear fellow if you can Stop my wandering away I am going Not yet not yet Tell me dear Eugene what is it I shall do Keep me here for only a single minute I am going away again Don t let me go Hear me speak first Stop me stop me My poor Eugene try to be calm I do try I try so hard If you only knew how hard Don t let me wander till I have spoken Give me a little more wine Lightwood complied Eugene with a most pathetic struggle against the unconsciousness that was coming over him and with a look of appeal that affected his friend profoundly said You can leave me with Jenny while you speak to her and tell her what I beseech of her You can leave me with Jenny while you are gone There s not much for you to do You won t be long away No no no But tell me what it is that I shall do Eugene I am going You can t hold me Tell me in a word Eugene His eyes were fixed again and the only word that came from his lips was the word millions of times repeated Lizzie Lizzie Lizzie But the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in her watch and she now came up and touched Lightwood s arm as he looked down at his friend despairingly Hush she said with her finger on her lips His eyes are closing He ll be conscious when he next opens them Shall I give you a leading word to say to him O Jenny if you could only give me the right word I can Stoop down He stooped and she whispered in his ear She whispered in his ear one short word of a single syllable Lightwood started and looked at her Try it said the little creature with an excited and exultant face She then bent over the unconscious man and for the first time kissed him on the cheek and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to her Then she withdrew to the foot of the bed Some two hours afterwards Mortimer Lightwood saw his consciousness come back and instantly but very tranquilly bent over him Don t speak Eugene Do no more than look at me and listen to me You follow what I say He moved his head in assent I am going on from the point where we broke off Is the word we should soon have come to is it Wife O God bless you Mortimer Hush Don t be agitated Don t speak Hear me dear Eugene Your mind will be more at peace lying here if you make Lizzie your wife You wish me to speak to her and tell her so and entreat her to be your wife You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you that your reparation may be complete Is that so Yes God bless you Yes It shall be done Eugene Trust it to me I shall have to go away for some few hours to give effect to your wishes You see this is unavoidable Dear friend I said so True But I had not the clue then How do you think I got it Glancing wistfully around Eugene saw Miss Jenny at the foot of the bed looking at him with her elbows on the bed and her head upon her hands There was a trace of his whimsical air upon him as he tried to smile at her Yes indeed said Lightwood the discovery was hers Observe my dear Eugene while I am away you will know that I have discharged my trust with Lizzie by finding her here in my present place at your bedside to leave you no more A final word before I go This is the right course of a true man Eugene And I solemnly believe with all my soul that if Providence should mercifully restore you to us you will be blessed with a noble wife in the preserver of your life whom you will dearly love Amen I am sure of that But I shall not come through it Mortimer You will not be the less hopeful or less strong for this Eugene No Touch my face with yours in case I should not hold out till you come back I love you Mortimer Don t be uneasy for me while you are gone If my dear brave girl will take me I feel persuaded that I shall live long enough to be married dear fellow Miss Jenny gave up altogether on this parting taking place between the friends and sitting with her back towards the bed in the bower made by her bright hair wept heartily though noiselessly Mortimer Lightwood was soon gone As the evening light lengthened the heavy reflections of the trees in the river another figure came with a soft step into the sick room Is he conscious asked the little dressmaker as the figure took its station by the pillow For Jenny had given place to it immediately and could not see the sufferer s face in the dark room from her new and removed position He is conscious Jenny murmured Eugene for himself He knows his wife Chapter eleven EFFECT IS GIVEN TO THE DOLLS DRESSMAKER S DISCOVERY missus John Rokesmith sat at needlework in her neat little room beside a basket of neat little articles of clothing which presented so much of the appearance of being in the dolls dressmaker s way of business that one might have supposed she was going to set up in opposition to Miss Wren Whether the Complete British Family Housewife had imparted sage counsel anent them did not appear but probably not as that cloudy oracle was nowhere visible For certain however missus John Rokesmith stitched at them with so dexterous a hand that she must have taken lessons of somebody Love is in all things a most wonderful teacher and perhaps love from a pictorial point of view with nothing on but a thimble had been teaching this branch of needlework to missus John Rokesmith It was near John s time for coming home but as missus John was desirous to finish a special triumph of her skill before dinner she did not go out to meet him Placidly though rather consequentially smiling she sat stitching away with a regular sound like a sort of dimpled little charming Dresden china clock by the very best maker A knock at the door and a ring at the bell Not John or Bella would have flown out to meet him Then who if not John Bella was asking herself the question when that fluttering little fool of a servant fluttered in saying mister Lightwood Oh good gracious Bella had but time to throw a handkerchief over the basket when mister Lightwood made his bow There was something amiss with mister Lightwood for he was strangely grave and looked ill With a brief reference to the happy time when it had been his privilege to know missus Rokesmith as Miss Wilfer mister Lightwood explained what was amiss with him and why he came He came bearing Lizzie Hexam s earnest hope that missus John Rokesmith would see her married Bella was so fluttered by the request and by the short narrative he had feelingly given her that there never was a more timely smelling bottle than John s knock My husband said Bella I ll bring him in But that turned out to be more easily said than done for the instant she mentioned mister Lightwood s name John stopped with his hand upon the lock of the room door Come up stairs my darling Bella was amazed by the flush in his face and by his sudden turning away What can it mean she thought as she accompanied him up stairs Now my life said John taking her on his knee tell me all about it All very well to say Tell me all about it but John was very much confused His attention evidently trailed off now and then even while Bella told him all about it Yet she knew that he took a great interest in Lizzie and her fortunes What could it mean You will come to this marriage with me John dear N no my love I can t do that You can t do that John No my dear it s quite out of the question Not to be thought of Am I to go alone John No my dear you will go with mister Lightwood Don t you think it s time we went down to mister Lightwood John dear Bella insinuated My darling it s almost time you went but I must ask you to excuse me to him altogether You never mean John dear that you are not going to see him Why he knows you have come home I told him so That s a little unfortunate but it can t be helped Unfortunate or fortunate I positively cannot see him my love Bella cast about in her mind what could be his reason for this unaccountable behaviour as she sat on his knee looking at him in astonishment and pouting a little A weak reason presented itself John dear you never can be jealous of mister Lightwood Why my precious child returned her husband laughing outright how could I be jealous of him Why should I be jealous of him Because you know John pursued Bella pouting a little more though he did rather admire me once it was not my fault It was your fault that I admired you returned her husband with a look of pride in her and why not your fault that he admired you But I jealous on that account Why I must go distracted for life if I turned jealous of every one who used to find my wife beautiful and winning I am half angry with you John dear said Bella laughing a little and half pleased with you because you are such a stupid old fellow and yet you say nice things as if you meant them Don t be mysterious sir What harm do you know of mister Lightwood None my love What has he ever done to you John He has never done anything to me my dear I know no more against him than I know against mister Wrayburn he has never done anything to me neither has mister Wrayburn And yet I have exactly the same objection to both of them Oh John retorted Bella as if she were giving him up for a bad job as she used to give up herself You are nothing better than a sphinx And a married sphinx isn t a isn t a nice confidential husband said Bella in a tone of injury Bella my life said John Rokesmith touching her cheek with a grave smile as she cast down her eyes and pouted again look at me I want to speak to you In earnest Blue Beard of the secret chamber asked Bella clearing her pretty face In earnest And I confess to the secret chamber Don t you remember that you asked me not to declare what I thought of your higher qualities until you had been tried Yes John dear And I fully meant it and I fully mean it The time will come my darling I am no prophet but I say so when you WILL be tried The time will come I think when you will undergo a trial through which you will never pass quite triumphantly for me unless you can put perfect faith in me Then you may be sure of me John dear for I can put perfect faith in you and I do and I always always will Don t judge me by a little thing like this John In little things I am a little thing myself I always was But in great things I hope not I don t mean to boast John dear but I hope not He was even better convinced of the truth of what she said than she was as he felt her loving arms about him If the Golden Dustman s riches had been his to stake he would have staked them to the last farthing on the fidelity through good and evil of her affectionate and trusting heart Now I ll go down to and go away with mister Lightwood said Bella springing up You are the most creasing and tumbling Clumsy Boots of a packer John that ever was but if you re quite good and will promise never to do so any more though I don t know what you have done you may pack me a little bag for a night while I get my bonnet on He gaily complied and she tied her dimpled chin up and shook her head into her bonnet and pulled out the bows of her bonnet strings and got her gloves on finger by finger and finally got them on her little plump hands and bade him good bye and went down mister Lightwood s impatience was much relieved when he found her dressed for departure mister Rokesmith goes with us he said hesitating with a look towards the door Oh I forgot replied Bella His best compliments His face is swollen to the size of two faces and he is to go to bed directly poor fellow to wait for the doctor who is coming to lance him It is curious observed Lightwood that I have never yet seen mister Rokesmith though we have been engaged in the same affairs Really said the unblushing Bella I begin to think observed Lightwood that I never shall see him These things happen so oddly sometimes said Bella with a steady countenance that there seems a kind of fatality in them But I am quite ready mister Lightwood They started directly in a little carriage that Lightwood had brought with him from never to be forgotten Greenwich and from Greenwich they started directly for London and in London they waited at a railway station until such time as the Reverend Frank Milvey and Margaretta his wife with whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference should come and join them That worthy couple were delayed by a portentous old parishioner of the female gender who was one of the plagues of their lives and with whom they bore with most exemplary sweetness and good humour notwithstanding her having an infection of absurdity about her that communicated itself to everything with which and everybody with whom she came in contact She was a member of the Reverend Frank s congregation and made a point of distinguishing herself in that body by conspicuously weeping at everything however cheering said by the Reverend Frank in his public ministration also by applying to herself the various lamentations of David and complaining in a personally injured manner much in arrear of the clerk and the rest of the respondents that her enemies were digging pit falls about her and breaking her with rods of iron Indeed this old widow discharged herself of that portion of the Morning and Evening Service as if she were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for a warrant before a magistrate But this was not her most inconvenient characteristic for that took the form of an impression usually recurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak that she had something on her mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank to come and take it off Many a time had that kind creature got up and gone out to missus Sprodgkin such was the disciple s name suppressing a strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it However beyond themselves the Reverend Frank Milvey and missus Milvey seldom hinted that missus Sprodgkin was hardly worth the trouble she gave but both made the best of her as they did of all their troubles This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense in regard of knowing when the Reverend Frank Milvey least desired her company and with promptitude appearing in his little hall Consequently when the Reverend Frank had willingly engaged that he and his wife would accompany Lightwood back he said as a matter of course We must make haste to get out Margaretta my dear or we shall be descended on by missus Sprodgkin To which missus Milvey replied in her pleasantly emphatic way Oh YES for she IS such a marplot Frank and DOES worry so Words that were scarcely uttered when their theme was announced as in faithful attendance below desiring counsel on a spiritual matter The points on which missus Sprodgkin sought elucidation being seldom of a pressing nature as Who begat Whom or some information concerning the Amorites missus Milvey on this special occasion resorted to the device of buying her off with a present of tea and sugar and a loaf and butter These gifts missus Sprodgkin accepted but still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall to curtsey to the Reverend Frank as he came forth Who incautiously saying in his genial manner Well Sally there you are involved himself in a discursive address from missus Sprodgkin revolving around the result that she regarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense and considered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey Having communicated this edifying piece of information missus Sprodgkin was left still unadjourned in the hall and mister and missus Milvey hurried in a heated condition to the railway station All of which is here recorded to the honour of that good Christian pair representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious and as useful who merge the smallness of their work in its greatness and feel in no danger of losing dignity when they adapt themselves to incomprehensible humbugs Detained at the last moment by one who had a claim upon me was the Reverend Frank s apology to Lightwood taking no thought of himself To which missus Milvey added taking thought for him like the championing little wife she was Oh yes detained at the last moment But AS to the claim Frank I MUST say that I DO think you are OVER considerate sometimes and allow THAT to be a LITTLE abused Bella felt conscious in spite of her late pledge for herself that her husband s absence would give disagreeable occasion for surprise to the Milveys Nor could she appear quite at her ease when missus Milvey asked HOW is mister Rokesmith and IS he gone before us or DOES he follow us It becoming necessary upon this to send him to bed again and hold him in waiting to be lanced again Bella did it But not half as well on the second occasion as on the first for a twice told white one seems almost to become a black one when you are not used to it Oh DEAR said missus Milvey I am SO sorry mister Rokesmith took SUCH an interest in Lizzie Hexam when we were there before And if we had ONLY known of his face we COULD have given him something that would have kept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose By way of making the white one whiter Bella hastened to stipulate that he was not in pain missus Milvey was SO glad of it I don t know HOW it is said missus Milvey and I am SURE you don t Frank but the clergy and their wives seem to CAUSE swelled faces Whenever I take notice of a child in the school it seems to me as if its face swelled INSTANTLY Frank NEVER makes acquaintance with a new old woman but she gets the face ache And another thing is we DO make the poor children sniff so I don t know HOW we do it and I should be so glad not to but the MORE we take notice of them the MORE they sniff Just as they do when the text is given out Frank that s a schoolmaster I have seen him somewhere The reference was to a young man of reserved appearance in a coat and waistcoat of black and pantaloons of pepper and salt He had come into the office of the station from its interior in an unsettled way immediately after Lightwood had gone out to the train and he had been hurriedly reading the printed hills and notices on the wall He had had a wandering interest in what was said among the people waiting there and passing to and fro He had drawn nearer at about the time when missus Milvey mentioned Lizzie Hexam and had remained near since though always glancing towards the door by which Lightwood had gone out He stood with his back towards them and his gloved hands clasped behind him There was now so evident a faltering upon him expressive of indecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself referred to that mister Milvey spoke to him I cannot recall your name he said but I remember to have seen you in your school My name is Bradley Headstone sir he replied backing into a more retired place I ought to have remembered it said mister Milvey giving him his hand I hope you are well A little overworked I am afraid Yes I am overworked just at present sir Had no play in your last holiday time No sir All work and no play mister Headstone will not make dulness in your case I dare say but it will make dyspepsia if you don t take care I will endeavour to take care sir Might I beg leave to speak to you outside a moment By all means It was evening and the office was well lighted The schoolmaster who had never remitted his watch on Lightwood s door now moved by another door to a corner without where there was more shadow than light and said plucking at his gloves One of your ladies sir mentioned within my hearing a name that I am acquainted with I may say well acquainted with The name of the sister of an old pupil of mine He was my pupil for a long time and has got on and gone upward rapidly The name of Hexam The name of Lizzie Hexam He seemed to be a shy man struggling against nervousness and spoke in a very constrained way The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer Yes replied mister Milvey We are going down to see her I gathered as much sir I hope there is nothing amiss with the sister of my old pupil I hope no bereavement has befallen her I hope she is in no affliction Has lost no relation mister Milvey thought this a man with a very odd manner and a dark downward look but he answered in his usual open way I am glad to tell you mister Headstone that the sister of your old pupil has not sustained any such loss You thought I might be going down to bury some one That may have been the connexion of ideas sir with your clerical character but I was not conscious of it Then you are not sir A man with a very odd manner indeed and with a lurking look that was quite oppressive No In fact said mister Milvey since you are so interested in the sister of your old pupil I may as well tell you that I am going down to marry her The schoolmaster started back Not to marry her myself said mister Milvey with a smile because I have a wife already To perform the marriage service at her wedding Bradley Headstone caught hold of a pillar behind him If mister Milvey knew an ashy face when he saw it he saw it then You are quite ill mister Headstone It is not much sir It will pass over very soon I am accustomed to be seized with giddiness Don t let me detain you sir I stand in need of no assistance I thank you Much obliged by your sparing me these minutes of your time As mister Milvey who had no more minutes to spare made a suitable reply and turned back into the office he observed the schoolmaster to lean against the pillar with his hat in his hand and to pull at his neckcloth as if he were trying to tear it off The Reverend Frank accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him by saying There is a person outside who seems to be really ill and to require some help though he says he does not Lightwood had by this time secured their places and the departure bell was about to be rung They took their seats and were beginning to move out of the station when the same attendant came running along the platform looking into all the carriages Oh You are here sir he said springing on the step and holding the window frame by his elbow as the carriage moved That person you pointed out to me is in a fit I infer from what he told me that he is subject to such attacks He will come to in the air in a little while He was took very bad to be sure and was biting and knocking about him the man said furiously Would the gentleman give him his card as he had seen him first The gentleman did so with the explanation that he knew no more of the man attacked than that he was a man of a very respectable occupation who had said he was out of health as his appearance would of itself have indicated The attendant received the card watched his opportunity for sliding down slid down and so it ended Then the train rattled among the house tops and among the ragged sides of houses torn down to make way for it and over the swarming streets and under the fruitful earth until it shot across the river bursting over the quiet surface like a bomb shell and gone again as if it had exploded in the rush of smoke and steam and glare A little more and again it roared across the river a great rocket spurning the watery turnings and doublings with ineffable contempt and going straight to its end as Father Time goes to his To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses produce their little growth of weeds and flowers turn here turn there are noisy or still are troubled or at rest for their course has one sure termination though their sources and devices are many Then a carriage ride succeeded near the solemn river stealing away by night as all things steal away by night and by day so quietly yielding to the attraction of the loadstone rock of Eternity and the nearer they drew to the chamber where Eugene lay the more they feared that they might find his wanderings done At last they saw its dim light shining out and it gave them hope though Lightwood faltered as he thought If he were gone she would still be sitting by him But he lay quiet half in stupor half in sleep Bella entering with a raised admonitory finger kissed Lizzie softly but said not a word Neither did any of them speak but all sat down at the foot of the bed silently waiting And now in this night watch mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train came the questions into Bella s mind again What could be in the depths of that mystery of John s Why was it that he had never been seen by mister Lightwood whom he still avoided When would that trial come through which her faith in and her duty to her dear husband was to carry her rendering him triumphant For that had been his term Her passing through the trial was to make the man she loved with all her heart triumphant Term not to sink out of sight in Bella s breast Far on in the night Eugene opened his eyes He was sensible and said at once How does the time go Has our Mortimer come back Lightwood was there immediately to answer for himself Yes Eugene and all is ready Dear boy returned Eugene with a smile we both thank you heartily Lizzie tell them how welcome they are and that I would be eloquent if I could There is no need said mister Milvey We know it Are you better mister Wrayburn I am much happier said Eugene Much better too I hope Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie as if to spare her and answered nothing Then they all stood around the bed and mister Milvey opening his book began the service so rarely associated with the shadow of death so inseparable in the mind from a flush of life and gaiety and hope and health and joy Bella thought how different from her own sunny little wedding and wept missus Milvey overflowed with pity and wept too The dolls dressmaker with her hands before her face wept in her golden bower Reading in a low clear voice and bending over Eugene who kept his eyes upon him mister Milvey did his office with suitable simplicity As the bridegroom could not move his hand they touched his fingers with the ring and so put it on the bride When the two plighted their troth she laid her hand on his and kept it there When the ceremony was done and all the rest departed from the room she drew her arm under his head and laid her own head down upon the pillow by his side Undraw the curtains my dear girl said Eugene after a while and let us see our wedding day The sun was rising and his first rays struck into the room as she came back and put her lips to his I bless the day said Eugene I bless the day said Lizzie You have made a poor marriage of it my sweet wife said Eugene A shattered graceless fellow stretched at his length here and next to nothing for you when you are a young widow I have made the marriage that I would have given all the world to dare to hope for she replied You have thrown yourself away said Eugene shaking his head But you have followed the treasure of your heart My justification is that you had thrown that away first dear girl No I had given it to you The same thing my poor Lizzie Hush hush A very different thing There were tears in his eyes and she besought him to close them No said Eugene again shaking his head let me look at you Lizzie while I can You brave devoted girl You heroine Her own eyes filled under his praises And when he mustered strength to move his wounded head a very little way and lay it on her bosom the tears of both fell Lizzie said Eugene after a silence when you see me wandering away from this refuge that I have so ill deserved speak to me by my name and I think I shall come back Yes dear Eugene There he exclaimed smiling I should have gone then but for that A little while afterwards when he appeared to be sinking into insensibility she said in a calm loving voice Eugene my dear husband He immediately answered There again You see how you can recall me And afterwards when he could not speak he still answered by a slight movement of his head upon her bosom The sun was high in the sky when she gently disengaged herself to give him the stimulants and nourishment he required The utter helplessness of the wreck of him that lay cast ashore there now alarmed her but he himself appeared a little more hopeful Ah my beloved Lizzie he said faintly How shall I ever pay all I owe you if I recover Don t be ashamed of me she replied and you will have more than paid all It would require a life Lizzie to pay all more than a life Live for that then live for me Eugene live to see how hard I will try to improve myself and never to discredit you My darling girl he replied rallying more of his old manner than he had ever yet got together On the contrary I have been thinking whether it is not the best thing I can do to die The best thing you can do to leave me with a broken heart I don t mean that my dear girl I was not thinking of that What I was thinking of was this Out of your compassion for me in this maimed and broken state you make so much of me you think so well of me you love me so dearly Heaven knows I love you dearly And Heaven knows I prize it Well If I live you ll find me out I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy and will turn it to the best account I hope so dearest Lizzie said Eugene wistfully and yet somewhat whimsically I hope so But I can t summon the vanity to think so How can I think so looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine I humbly hope it but I daren t believe it There is a sharp misgiving in my conscience that if I were to live I should disappoint your good opinion and my own and that I ought to die my dear Chapter twelve THE PASSING SHADOW The winds and tides rose and fell a certain number of times the earth moved round the sun a certain number of times the ship upon the ocean made her voyage safely and brought a baby Bella home Then who so blest and happy as missus John Rokesmith saving and excepting mister John Rokesmith Would you not like to be rich NOW my darling How can you ask me such a question John dear Am I not rich These were among the first words spoken near the baby Bella as she lay asleep She soon proved to be a baby of wonderful intelligence evincing the strongest objection to her grandmother s society and being invariably seized with a painful acidity of the stomach when that dignified lady honoured her with any attention It was charming to see Bella contemplating this baby and finding out her own dimples in that tiny reflection as if she were looking in the glass without personal vanity Her cherubic father justly remarked to her husband that the baby seemed to make her younger than before reminding him of the days when she had a pet doll and used to talk to it as she carried it about The world might have been challenged to produce another baby who had such a store of pleasant nonsense said and sung to it as Bella said and sung to this baby or who was dressed and undressed as often in four and twenty hours as Bella dressed and undressed this baby or who was held behind doors and poked out to stop its father s way when he came home as this baby was or in a word who did half the number of baby things through the lively invention of a gay and proud young mother that this inexhaustible baby did The inexhaustible baby was two or three months old when Bella began to notice a cloud upon her husband s brow Watching it she saw a gathering and deepening anxiety there which caused her great disquiet More than once she awoke him muttering in his sleep and though he muttered nothing worse than her own name it was plain to her that his restlessness originated in some load of care Therefore Bella at length put in her claim to divide this load and hear her half of it You know John dear she said cheerily reverting to their former conversation that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things And it surely cannot be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness It s very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are uncomfortable about something but it s quite impossible to be done John love I admit that I am rather uneasy my own Then please to tell me what about sir But no he evaded that Never mind thought Bella resolutely John requires me to put perfect faith in him and he shall not be disappointed She went up to London one day to meet him in order that they might make some purchases She found him waiting for her at her journey s end and they walked away together through the streets He was in gay spirits though still harping on that notion of their being rich and he said now let them make believe that yonder fine carriage was theirs and that it was waiting to take them home to a fine house they had what would Bella in that case best like to find in the house Well Bella didn t know already having everything she wanted she couldn t say But by degrees she was led on to confess that she would like to have for the inexhaustible baby such a nursery as never was seen It was to be a very rainbow for colours as she was quite sure baby noticed colours and the staircase was to be adorned with the most exquisite flowers as she was absolutely certain baby noticed flowers and there was to be an aviary somewhere of the loveliest little birds as there was not the smallest doubt in the world that baby noticed birds Was there nothing else No John dear The predilections of the inexhaustible baby being provided for Bella could think of nothing else They were chatting on in this way and John had suggested No jewels for your own wear for instance and Bella had replied laughing O if he came to that yes there might be a beautiful ivory case of jewels on her dressing table when these pictures were in a moment darkened and blotted out They turned a corner and met mister Lightwood He stopped as if he were petrified by the sight of Bella s husband who in the same moment had changed colour mister Lightwood and I have met before he said Met before John Bella repeated in a tone of wonder mister Lightwood told me he had never seen you I did not then know that I had said Lightwood discomposed on her account I believed that I had only heard of mister Rokesmith With an emphasis on the name When mister Lightwood saw me my love observed her husband not avoiding his eye but looking at him my name was Julius Handford Julius Handford The name that Bella had so often seen in old newspapers when she was an inmate of mister Boffin s house Julius Handford who had been publicly entreated to appear and for intelligence of whom a reward had been publicly offered I would have avoided mentioning it in your presence said Lightwood to Bella delicately but since your husband mentions it himself I must confirm his strange admission I saw him as mister Julius Handford and I afterwards unquestionably to his knowledge took great pains to trace him out Quite true But it was not my object or my interest said Rokesmith quietly to be traced out Bella looked from the one to the other in amazement mister Lightwood pursued her husband as chance has brought us face to face at last which is not to be wondered at for the wonder is that in spite of all my pains to the contrary chance has not confronted us together sooner I have only to remind you that you have been at my house and to add that I have not changed my residence Sir returned Lightwood with a meaning glance towards Bella my position is a truly painful one I hope that no complicity in a very dark transaction may attach to you but you cannot fail to know that your own extraordinary conduct has laid you under suspicion I know it has was all the reply My professional duty said Lightwood hesitating with another glance towards Bella is greatly at variance with my personal inclination but I doubt mister Handford or mister Rokesmith whether I am justified in taking leave of you here with your whole course unexplained Bella caught her husband by the hand Don t be alarmed my darling mister Lightwood will find that he is quite justified in taking leave of me here At all events added Rokesmith he will find that I mean to take leave of him here I think sir said Lightwood you can scarcely deny that when I came to your house on the occasion to which you have referred you avoided me of a set purpose mister Lightwood I assure you I have no disposition to deny it or intention to deny it I should have continued to avoid you in pursuance of the same set purpose for a short time longer if we had not met now I am going straight home and shall remain at home to morrow until noon Hereafter I hope we may be better acquainted Good day Lightwood stood irresolute but Bella s husband passed him in the steadiest manner with Bella on his arm and they went home without encountering any further remonstrance or molestation from any one When they had dined and were alone John Rokesmith said to his wife who had preserved her cheerfulness And you don t ask me my dear why I bore that name No John love I should dearly like to know of course which her anxious face confirmed but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you and I said yes and I meant it It did not escape Bella s notice that he began to look triumphant She wanted no strengthening in her firmness but if she had had need of any she would have derived it from his kindling face You cannot have been prepared my dearest for such a discovery as that this mysterious mister Handford was identical with your husband No John dear of course not But you told me to prepare to be tried and I prepared myself He drew her to nestle closer to him and told her it would soon be over and the truth would soon appear And now he went on lay stress my dear on these words that I am going to add I stand in no kind of peril and I can by possibility be hurt at no one s hand You are quite quite sure of that John dear Not a hair of my head Moreover I have done no wrong and have injured no man Shall I swear it No John cried Bella laying her hand upon his lips with a proud look Never to me But circumstances he went on I can and I will disperse them in a moment have surrounded me with one of the strangest suspicions ever known You heard mister Lightwood speak of a dark transaction Yes John You are prepared to hear explicitly what he meant Yes John My life he meant the murder of John Harmon your allotted husband With a fast palpitating heart Bella grasped him by the arm You cannot be suspected John Dear love I can be for I am There was silence between them as she sat looking in his face with the colour quite gone from her own face and lips How dare they she cried at length in a burst of generous indignation My beloved husband how dare they He caught her in his arms as she opened hers and held her to his heart Even knowing this you can trust me Bella I can trust you John dear with all my soul If I could not trust you I should fall dead at your feet The kindling triumph in his face was bright indeed as he looked up and rapturously exclaimed what had he done to deserve the blessing of this dear confiding creature s heart Again she put her hand upon his lips saying Hush and then told him in her own little natural pathetic way that if all the world were against him she would be for him that if all the world repudiated him she would believe him that if he were infamous in other eyes he would be honoured in hers and that under the worst unmerited suspicion she could devote her life to consoling him and imparting her own faith in him to their little child A twilight calm of happiness then succeeding to their radiant noon they remained at peace until a strange voice in the room startled them both The room being by that time dark the voice said Don t let the lady be alarmed by my striking a light and immediately a match rattled and glimmered in a hand The hand and the match and the voice were then seen by John Rokesmith to belong to mister Inspector once meditatively active in this chronicle I take the liberty said mister Inspector in a business like manner to bring myself to the recollection of mister Julius Handford who gave me his name and address down at our place a considerable time ago Would the lady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece to throw a further light upon the subject No Thank you ma am Now we look cheerful mister Inspector in a dark blue buttoned up frock coat and pantaloons presented a serviceable half pay Royal Arms kind of appearance as he applied his pocket handkerchief to his nose and bowed to the lady You favoured me mister Handford said mister Inspector by writing down your name and address and I produce the piece of paper on which you wrote it Comparing the same with the writing on the fly leaf of this book on the table and a sweet pretty volume it is I find the writing of the entry missus John Rokesmith From her husband on her birthday and very gratifying to the feelings such memorials are to correspond exactly Can I have a word with you Certainly Here if you please was the reply Why retorted mister Inspector again using his pocket handkerchief though there s nothing for the lady to be at all alarmed at still ladies are apt to take alarm at matters of business being of that fragile sex that they re not accustomed to them when not of a strictly domestic character and I do generally make it a rule to propose retirement from the presence of ladies before entering upon business topics Or perhaps mister Inspector hinted if the lady was to step up stairs and take a look at baby now missus Rokesmith her husband was beginning when mister Inspector regarding the words as an introduction said Happy I am sure to have the honour And bowed with gallantry missus Rokesmith resumed her husband is satisfied that she can have no reason for being alarmed whatever the business is Really Is that so said mister Inspector But it s a sex to live and learn from and there s nothing a lady can t accomplish when she once fully gives her mind to it It s the case with my own wife Well ma am this good gentleman of yours has given rise to a rather large amount of trouble which might have been avoided if he had come forward and explained himself Well you see He DIDN T come forward and explain himself Consequently now that we meet him and me you ll say and say right that there s nothing to be alarmed at in my proposing to him TO come forward or putting the same meaning in another form to come along with me and explain himself When mister Inspector put it in that other form to come along with me there was a relishing roll in his voice and his eye beamed with an official lustre Do you propose to take me into custody inquired John Rokesmith very coolly Why argue returned mister Inspector in a comfortable sort of remonstrance ain t it enough that I propose that you shall come along with me For what reason Lord bless my soul and body returned mister Inspector I wonder at it in a man of your education Why argue What do you charge against me I wonder at you before a lady said mister Inspector shaking his head reproachfully I wonder brought up as you have been you haven t a more delicate mind I charge you then with being some way concerned in the Harmon Murder I don t say whether before or in or after the fact I don t say whether with having some knowledge of it that hasn t come out You don t surprise me I foresaw your visit this afternoon Don t said mister Inspector Why why argue It s my duty to inform you that whatever you say will be used against you I don t think it will But I tell you it will said mister Inspector Now having received the caution do you still say that you foresaw my visit this afternoon Yes And I will say something more if you will step with me into the next room With a reassuring kiss on the lips of the frightened Bella her husband to whom mister Inspector obligingly offered his arm took up a candle and withdrew with that gentleman They were a full half hour in conference When they returned mister Inspector looked considerably astonished I have invited this worthy officer my dear said John to make a short excursion with me in which you shall be a sharer He will take something to eat and drink I dare say on your invitation while you are getting your bonnet on mister Inspector declined eating but assented to the proposal of a glass of brandy and water Mixing this cold and pensively consuming it he broke at intervals into such soliloquies as that he never did know such a move that he never had been so gravelled and that what a game was this to try the sort of stuff a man s opinion of himself was made of Concurrently with these comments he more than once burst out a laughing with the half enjoying and half piqued air of a man who had given up a good conundrum after much guessing and been told the answer Bella was so timid of him that she noted these things in a half shrinking half perceptive way and similarly noted that there was a great change in his manner towards John That coming along with him deportment was now lost in long musing looks at John and at herself and sometimes in slow heavy rubs of his hand across his forehead as if he were ironing cut the creases which his deep pondering made there He had had some coughing and whistling satellites secretly gravitating towards him about the premises but they were now dismissed and he eyed John as if he had meant to do him a public service but had unfortunately been anticipated Whether Bella might have noted anything more if she had been less afraid of him she could not determine but it was all inexplicable to her and not the faintest flash of the real state of the case broke in upon her mind mister Inspector s increased notice of herself and knowing way of raising his eyebrows when their eyes by any chance met as if he put the question Don t you see augmented her timidity and consequently her perplexity For all these reasons when he and she and John at towards nine o clock of a winter evening went to London and began driving from London Bridge among low lying water side wharves and docks and strange places Bella was in the state of a dreamer perfectly unable to account for her being there perfectly unable to forecast what would happen next or whither she was going or why certain of nothing in the immediate present but that she confided in John and that John seemed somehow to be getting more triumphant But what a certainty was that They alighted at last at the corner of a court where there was a building with a bright lamp and wicket gate Its orderly appearance was very unlike that of the surrounding neighbourhood and was explained by the inscription POLICE STATION We are not going in here John said Bella clinging to him Yes my dear but of our own accord We shall come out again as easily never fear The whitewashed room was pure white as of old the methodical book keeping was in peaceful progress as of old and some distant howler was banging against a cell door as of old The sanctuary was not a permanent abiding place but a kind of criminal Pickford s The lower passions and vices were regularly ticked off in the books warehoused in the cells carted away as per accompanying invoice and left little mark upon it mister Inspector placed two chairs for his visitors before the fire and communed in a low voice with a brother of his order also of a half pay and Royal Arms aspect who judged only by his occupation at the moment might have been a writing master setting copies Their conference done mister Inspector returned to the fireplace and having observed that he would step round to the Fellowships and see how matters stood went out He soon came back again saying Nothing could be better for they re at supper with Miss Abbey in the bar and then they all three went out together Still as in a dream Bella found herself entering a snug old fashioned public house and found herself smuggled into a little three cornered room nearly opposite the bar of that establishment mister Inspector achieved the smuggling of herself and John into this queer room called Cosy in an inscription on the door by entering in the narrow passage first in order and suddenly turning round upon them with extended arms as if they had been two sheep The room was lighted for their reception Now said mister Inspector to John turning the gas lower I ll mix with em in a casual way and when I say Identification perhaps you ll show yourself John nodded and mister Inspector went alone to the half door of the bar From the dim doorway of Cosy within which Bella and her husband stood they could see a comfortable little party of three persons sitting at supper in the bar and could hear everything that was said The three persons were Miss Abbey and two male guests To whom collectively mister Inspector remarked that the weather was getting sharp for the time of year It need be sharp to suit your wits sir said Miss Abbey What have you got in hand now Thanking you for your compliment not much Miss Abbey was mister Inspector s rejoinder Who have you got in Cosy asked Miss Abbey Only a gentleman and his wife Miss And who are they If one may ask it without detriment to your deep plans in the interests of the honest public said Miss Abbey proud of mister Inspector as an administrative genius They are strangers in this part of the town Miss Abbey They are waiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere for half a moment While they re waiting said Miss Abbey couldn t you join us mister Inspector immediately slipped into the bar and sat down at the side of the half door with his back towards the passage and directly facing the two guests I don t take my supper till later in the night said he and therefore I won t disturb the compactness of the table But I ll take a glass of flip if that s flip in the jug in the fender That s flip replied Miss Abbey and it s my making and if even you can find out better I shall be glad to know where Filling him with hospitable hands a steaming tumbler Miss Abbey replaced the jug by the fire the company not having yet arrived at the flip stage of their supper but being as yet skirmishing with strong ale Ah h cried mister Inspector That s the smack There s not a Detective in the Force Miss Abbey that could find out better stuff than that Glad to hear you say so rejoined Miss Abbey You ought to know if anybody does mister Job Potterson mister Inspector continued I drink your health mister Jacob Kibble I drink yours Hope you have made a prosperous voyage home gentlemen both mister Kibble an unctuous broad man of few words and many mouthfuls said more briefly than pointedly raising his ale to his lips Same to you mister Job Potterson a semi seafaring man of obliging demeanour said Thank you sir Lord bless my soul and body cried mister Inspector Talk of trades Miss Abbey and the way they set their marks on men a subject which nobody had approached who wouldn t know your brother to be a Steward There s a bright and ready twinkle in his eye there s a neatness in his action there s a smartness in his figure there s an air of reliability about him in case you wanted a basin which points out the steward And mister Kibble ain t he Passenger all over While there s that mercantile cut upon him which would make you happy to give him credit for five hundred pound don t you see the salt sea shining on him too YOU do I dare say returned Miss Abbey but I don t And as for stewarding I think it s time my brother gave that up and took his House in hand on his sister s retiring The House will go to pieces if he don t I wouldn t sell it for any money that could be told out to a person that I couldn t depend upon to be a Law to the Porters as I have been There you re right Miss said mister Inspector A better kept house is not known to our men What do I say Half so well a kept house is not known to our men Show the Force the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters and the Force to a constable will show you a piece of perfection mister Kibble That gentleman with a very serious shake of his head subscribed the article And talk of Time slipping by you as if it was an animal at rustic sports with its tail soaped said mister Inspector again a subject which nobody had approached why well you may Well you may How has it slipped by us since the time when mister Job Potterson here present mister Jacob Kibble here present and an Officer of the Force here present first came together on a matter of Identification Bella s husband stepped softly to the half door of the bar and stood there How has Time slipped by us mister Inspector went on slowly with his eyes narrowly observant of the two guests since we three very men at an Inquest in this very house mister Kibble Taken ill sir mister Kibble had staggered up with his lower jaw dropped catching Potterson by the shoulder and pointing to the half door He now cried out Potterson Look Look there Potterson started up started back and exclaimed Heaven defend us what s that Bella s husband stepped back to Bella took her in his arms for she was terrified by the unintelligible terror of the two men and shut the door of the little room A hurry of voices succeeded in which mister Inspector s voice was busiest it gradually slackened and sank and mister Inspector reappeared Sharp s the word sir he said looking in with a knowing wink We ll get your lady out at once Immediately Bella and her husband were under the stars making their way back alone to the vehicle they had kept in waiting All this was most extraordinary and Bella could make nothing of it but that John was in the right How in the right and how suspected of being in the wrong she could not divine Some vague idea that he had never really assumed the name of Handford and that there was a remarkable likeness between him and that mysterious person was her nearest approach to any definite explanation But John was triumphant that much was made apparent and she could wait for the rest When John came home to dinner next day he said sitting down on the sofa by Bella and baby Bella My dear I have a piece of news to tell you I have left the China House As he seemed to like having left it Bella took it for granted that there was no misfortune in the case In a word my love said John the China House is broken up and abolished There is no such thing any more Then are you already in another House John Yes my darling I am in another way of business And I am rather better off The inexhaustible baby was instantly made to congratulate him and to say with appropriate action on the part of a very limp arm and a speckled fist Three cheers ladies and gemplemorums Hoo ray I am afraid my life said John that you have become very much attached to this cottage Afraid I have John Of course I have The reason why I said afraid returned John is because we must move O John Yes my dear we must move We must have our head quarters in London now In short there s a dwelling house rent free attached to my new position and we must occupy it That s a gain John Yes my dear it is undoubtedly a gain He gave her a very blithe look and a very sly look Which occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists and demand in a threatening manner what he meant My love you said it was a gain and I said it was a gain A very innocent remark surely I won t said the inexhaustible baby allow you to make game of my venerable Ma At each division administering a soft facer with one of the speckled fists John having stooped down to receive these punishing visitations Bella asked him would it be necessary to move soon Why yes indeed said John he did propose that they should move very soon Taking the furniture with them of course said Bella Why no said John the fact was that the house was in a sort of a kind of a way furnished already The inexhaustible baby hearing this resumed the offensive and said But there s no nursery for me sir What do you mean marble hearted parent To which the marble hearted parent rejoined that there was a sort of a kind of a nursery and it might be made to do Made to do returned the Inexhaustible administering more punishment what do you take me for And was then turned over on its back in Bella s lap and smothered with kisses But really John dear said Bella flushed in quite a lovely manner by these exercises will the new house just as it stands do for baby That s the question I felt that to be the question he returned and therefore I arranged that you should come with me and look at it to morrow morning Appointment made accordingly for Bella to go up with him to morrow morning John kissed and Bella delighted When they reached London in pursuance of their little plan they took coach and drove westward Not only drove westward but drove into that particular westward division which Bella had seen last when she turned her face from mister Boffin s door Not only drove into that particular division but drove at last into that very street Not only drove into that very street but stopped at last at that very house John dear cried Bella looking out of window in a flutter Do you see where we are Yes my love The coachman s quite right The house door was opened without any knocking or ringing and John promptly helped her out The servant who stood holding the door asked no question of John neither did he go before them or follow them as they went straight up stairs It was only her husband s encircling arm urging her on that prevented Bella from stopping at the foot of the staircase As they ascended it was seen to be tastefully ornamented with most beautiful flowers O John said Bella faintly What does this mean Nothing my darling nothing Let us go on Going on a little higher they came to a charming aviary in which a number of tropical birds more gorgeous in colour than the flowers were flying about and among those birds were gold and silver fish and mosses and water lilies and a fountain and all manner of wonders O my dear John said Bella What does this mean Nothing my darling nothing Let us go on They went on until they came to a door As John put out his hand to open it Bella caught his hand I don t know what it means but it s too much for me Hold me John love John caught her up in his arm and lightly dashed into the room with her Behold mister and missus Boffin beaming Behold missus Boffin clapping her hands in an ecstacy running to Bella with tears of joy pouring down her comely face and folding her to her breast with the words My deary deary deary girl that Noddy and me saw married and couldn t wish joy to or so much as speak to My deary deary deary wife of John and mother of his little child My loving loving bright bright Pretty Pretty Welcome to your house and home my deary Chapter thirteen SHOWING HOW THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN HELPED TO SCATTER DUST In all the first bewilderment of her wonder the most bewilderingly wonderful thing to Bella was the shining countenance of mister Boffin That his wife should be joyous open hearted and genial or that her face should express every quality that was large and trusting and no quality that was little or mean was accordant with Bella s experience But that he with a perfectly beneficent air and a plump rosy face should be standing there looking at her and John like some jovial good spirit was marvellous For how had he looked when she last saw him in that very room it was the room in which she had given him that piece of her mind at parting and what had become of all those crooked lines of suspicion avarice and distrust that twisted his visage then missus Boffin seated Bella on the large ottoman and seated herself beside her and John her husband seated himself on the other side of her and mister Boffin stood beaming at every one and everything he could see with surpassing jollity and enjoyment missus Boffin was then taken with a laughing fit of clapping her hands and clapping her knees and rocking herself to and fro and then with another laughing fit of embracing Bella and rocking her to and fro both fits of considerable duration Old lady old lady said mister Boffin at length if you don t begin somebody else must I m a going to begin Noddy my dear returned missus Boffin Only it isn t easy for a person to know where to begin when a person is in this state of delight and happiness Bella my dear Tell me who s this Who is this repeated Bella My husband Ah But tell me his name deary cried missus Boffin Rokesmith No it ain t cried missus Boffin clapping her hands and shaking her head Not a bit of it Handford then suggested Bella No it ain t cried missus Boffin again clapping her hands and shaking her head Not a bit of it At least his name is John I suppose said Bella Ah I should think so deary cried missus Boffin I should hope so Many and many is the time I have called him by his name of John But what s his other name his true other name Give a guess my pretty I can t guess said Bella turning her pale face from one to another I could cried missus Boffin and what s more I did I found him out all in a flash as I may say one night Didn t I Noddy Ay That the old lady did said mister Boffin with stout pride in the circumstance Harkee to me deary pursued missus Boffin taking Bella s hands between her own and gently beating on them from time to time It was after a particular night when John had been disappointed as he thought in his affections It was after a night when John had made an offer to a certain young lady and the certain young lady had refused it It was after a particular night when he felt himself cast away like and had made up his mind to go seek his fortune It was the very next night My Noddy wanted a paper out of his Secretary s room and I says to Noddy I am going by the door and I ll ask him for it I tapped at his door and he didn t hear me I looked in and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire brooding over it He chanced to look up with a pleased kind of smile in my company when he saw me and then in a single moment every grain of the gunpowder that had been lying sprinkled thick about him ever since I first set eyes upon him as a man at the Bower took fire Too many a time had I seen him sitting lonely when he was a poor child to be pitied heart and hand Too many a time had I seen him in need of being brightened up with a comforting word Too many and too many a time to be mistaken when that glimpse of him come at last No no I just makes out to cry I know you now You re John And he catches me as I drops So what says missus Boffin breaking off in the rush of her speech to smile most radiantly might you think by this time that your husband s name was dear Not returned Bella with quivering lips not Harmon That s not possible Don t tremble Why not possible deary when so many things are possible demanded missus Boffin in a soothing tone He was killed gasped Bella Thought to be said missus Boffin But if ever John Harmon drew the breath of life on earth that is certainly John Harmon s arm round your waist now my pretty If ever John Harmon had a wife on earth that wife is certainly you If ever John Harmon and his wife had a child on earth that child is certainly this By a master stroke of secret arrangement the inexhaustible baby here appeared at the door suspended in mid air by invisible agency missus Boffin plunging at it brought it to Bella s lap where both missus and mister Boffin as the saying is took it out of the Inexhaustible in a shower of caresses It was only this timely appearance that kept Bella from swooning This and her husband s earnestness in explaining further to her how it had come to pass that he had been supposed to be slain and had even been suspected of his own murder also how he had put a pious fraud upon her which had preyed upon his mind as the time for its disclosure approached lest she might not make full allowance for the object with which it had originated and in which it had fully developed But bless ye my beauty cried missus Boffin taking him up short at this point with another hearty clap of her hands It wasn t John only that was in it We was all of us in it I don t said Bella looking vacantly from one to another yet understand Of course you don t my deary exclaimed missus Boffin How can you till you re told So now I am a going to tell you So you put your two hands between my two hands again cried the comfortable creature embracing her with that blessed little picter lying on your lap and you shall be told all the story Now I m a going to tell the story Once twice three times and the horses is off Here they go When I cries out that night I know you now you re John which was my exact words wasn t they John Your exact words said John laying his hand on hers That s a very good arrangement cried missus Boffin Keep it there John And as we was all of us in it Noddy you come and lay yours a top of his and we won t break the pile till the story s done mister Boffin hitched up a chair and added his broad brown right hand to the heap That s capital said missus Boffin giving it a kiss Seems quite a family building don t it But the horses is off Well When I cries out that night I know you now you re John John catches of me it is true but I ain t a light weight bless ye and he s forced to let me down Noddy he hears a noise and in he trots and as soon as I anyways comes to myself I calls to him Noddy well I might say as I did say that night at the Bower for the Lord be thankful this is John On which he gives a heave and down he goes likewise with his head under the writing table This brings me round comfortable and that brings him round comfortable and then John and him and me we all fall a crying for joy Yes They cry for joy my darling her husband struck in You understand These two whom I come to life to disappoint and dispossess cry for joy Bella looked at him confusedly and looked again at missus Boffin s radiant face That s right my dear don t you mind him said missus Boffin stick to me Well Then we sits down gradually gets cool and holds a confabulation John he tells us how he is despairing in his mind on accounts of a certain fair young person and how if I hadn t found him out he was going away to seek his fortune far and wide and had fully meant never to come to life but to leave the property as our wrongful inheritance for ever and a day At which you never see a man so frightened as my Noddy was For to think that he should have come into the property wrongful however innocent and more than that might have gone on keeping it to his dying day turned him whiter than chalk And you too said mister Boffin Don t you mind him neither my deary resumed missus Boffin stick to me This brings up a confabulation regarding the certain fair young person when Noddy he gives it as his opinion that she is a deary creetur She may be a leetle spoilt and nat rally spoilt he says by circumstances but that s only the surface and I lay my life he says that she s the true golden gold at heart So did you said mister Boffin Don t you mind him a single morsel my dear proceeded missus Boffin but stick to me Then says John O if he could but prove so Then we both of us ups and says that minute Prove so With a start Bella directed a hurried glance towards mister Boffin But he was sitting thoughtfully smiling at that broad brown hand of his and either didn t see it or would take no notice of it Prove it John we says repeated missus Boffin Prove it and overcome your doubts with triumph and be happy for the first time in your life and for the rest of your life This puts John in a state to be sure Then we says What will content you If she was to stand up for you when you was slighted if she was to show herself of a generous mind when you was oppressed if she was to be truest to you when you was poorest and friendliest and all this against her own seeming interest how would that do Do says John it would raise me to the skies Then says my Noddy make your preparations for the ascent John it being my firm belief that up you go Bella caught mister Boffin s twinkling eye for half an instant but he got it away from her and restored it to his broad brown hand From the first you was always a special favourite of Noddy s said missus Boffin shaking her head O you were And if I had been inclined to be jealous I don t know what I mightn t have done to you But as I wasn t why my beauty with a hearty laugh and an embrace I made you a special favourite of my own too But the horses is coming round the corner Well Then says my Noddy shaking his sides till he was fit to make em ache again Look out for being slighted and oppressed John for if ever a man had a hard master you shall find me from this present time to be such to you And then he began cried missus Boffin in an ecstacy of admiration Lord bless you then he began And how he DID begin didn t he Bella looked half frightened and yet half laughed But bless you pursued missus Boffin if you could have seen him of a night at that time of it The way he d sit and chuckle over himself The way he d say I ve been a regular brown bear to day and take himself in his arms and hug himself at the thoughts of the brute he had pretended But every night he says to me Better and better old lady What did we say of her She ll come through it the true golden gold This ll be the happiest piece of work we ever done And then he d say I ll be a grislier old growler to morrow and laugh he would till John and me was often forced to slap his back and bring it out of his windpipes with a little water mister Boffin with his face bent over his heavy hand made no sound but rolled his shoulders when thus referred to as if he were vastly enjoying himself And so my good and pretty pursued missus Boffin you was married and there was we hid up in the church organ by this husband of yours for he wouldn t let us out with it then as was first meant No he says she s so unselfish and contented that I can t afford to be rich yet I must wait a little longer Then when baby was expected he says She is such a cheerful glorious housewife that I can t afford to be rich yet I must wait a little longer Then when baby was born he says She is so much better than she ever was that I can t afford to be rich yet I must wait a little longer And so he goes on and on till I says outright Now John if you don t fix a time for setting her up in her own house and home and letting us walk out of it I ll turn Informer Then he says he ll only wait to triumph beyond what we ever thought possible and to show her to us better than even we ever supposed and he says She shall see me under suspicion of having murdered myself and YOU shall see how trusting and how true she ll be Well Noddy and me agreed to that and he was right and here you are and the horses is in and the story is done and God bless you my Beauty and God bless us all The pile of hands dispersed and Bella and missus Boffin took a good long hug of one another to the apparent peril of the inexhaustible baby lying staring in Bella s lap But IS the story done said Bella pondering Is there no more of it What more of it should there be deary returned missus Boffin full of glee Are you sure you have left nothing out of it asked Bella I don t think I have said missus Boffin archly John dear said Bella you re a good nurse will you please hold baby Having deposited the Inexhaustible in his arms with those words Bella looked hard at mister Boffin who had moved to a table where he was leaning his head upon his hand with his face turned away and quietly settling herself on her knees at his side and drawing one arm over his shoulder said Please I beg your pardon and I made a small mistake of a word when I took leave of you last Please I think you are better not worse than Hopkins better not worse than Dancer better not worse than Blackberry Jones better not worse than any of them Please something more cried Bella with an exultant ringing laugh as she struggled with him and forced him to turn his delighted face to hers Please I have found out something not yet mentioned Please I don t believe you are a hard hearted miser at all and please I don t believe you ever for one single minute were At this missus Boffin fairly screamed with rapture and sat beating her feet upon the floor clapping her hands and bobbing herself backwards and forwards like a demented member of some Mandarin s family O I understand you now sir cried Bella I want neither you nor any one else to tell me the rest of the story I can tell it to YOU now if you would like to hear it Can you my dear said mister Boffin Tell it then What cried Bella holding him prisoner by the coat with both hands When you saw what a greedy little wretch you were the patron of you determined to show her how much misused and misprized riches could do and often had done to spoil people did you Not caring what she thought of you and Goodness knows THAT was of no consequence you showed her in yourself the most detestable sides of wealth saying in your own mind This shallow creature would never work the truth out of her own weak soul if she had a hundred years to do it in but a glaring instance kept before her may open even her eyes and set her thinking That was what you said to yourself was it sir I never said anything of the sort mister Boffin declared in a state of the highest enjoyment Then you ought to have said it sir returned Bella giving him two pulls and one kiss for you must have thought and meant it You saw that good fortune was turning my stupid head and hardening my silly heart was making me grasping calculating insolent insufferable and you took the pains to be the dearest and kindest fingerpost that ever was set up anywhere pointing out the road that I was taking and the end it led to Confess instantly John said mister Boffin one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot I wish you d help me out of this You can t be heard by counsel sir returned Bella You must speak for yourself Confess instantly Well my dear said mister Boffin the truth is that when we did go in for the little scheme that my old lady has pinted out I did put it to John what did he think of going in for some such general scheme as YOU have pinted out But I didn t in any way so word it because I didn t in any way so mean it I only said to John wouldn t it be more consistent me going in for being a reg lar brown bear respecting him to go in as a reg lar brown bear all round Confess this minute sir said Bella that you did it to correct and amend me Certainly my dear child said mister Boffin I didn t do it to harm you you may be sure of that And I did hope it might just hint a caution Still it ought to be mentioned that no sooner had my old lady found out John than John made known to her and me that he had had his eye upon a thankless person by the name of Silas Wegg Partly for the punishment of which Wegg by leading him on in a very unhandsome and underhanded game that he was playing them books that you and me bought so many of together and by the by my dear he wasn t Blackberry Jones but Blewberry was read aloud to me by that person of the name of Silas Wegg aforesaid Bella who was still on her knees at mister Boffin s feet gradually sank down into a sitting posture on the ground as she meditated more and more thoughtfully with her eyes upon his beaming face Still said Bella after this meditative pause there remain two things that I cannot understand missus Boffin never supposed any part of the change in mister Boffin to be real did she You never did did you asked Bella turning to her No returned missus Boffin with a most rotund and glowing negative And yet you took it very much to heart said Bella I remember its making you very uneasy indeed Ecod you see missus John has a sharp eye John cried mister Boffin shaking his head with an admiring air You re right my dear The old lady nearly blowed us into shivers and smithers many times Why asked Bella How did that happen when she was in your secret Why it was a weakness in the old lady said mister Boffin and yet to tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth I m rather proud of it My dear the old lady thinks so high of me that she couldn t abear to see and hear me coming out as a reg lar brown one Couldn t abear to make believe as I meant it In consequence of which we was everlastingly in danger with her missus Boffin laughed heartily at herself but a certain glistening in her honest eyes revealed that she was by no means cured of that dangerous propensity I assure you my dear said mister Boffin that on the celebrated day when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest demonstration I allude to Mew says the cat Quack quack says the duck and Bow wow wow says the dog I assure you my dear that on that celebrated day them flinty and unbelieving words hit my old lady so hard on my account that I had to hold her to prevent her running out after you and defending me by saying I was playing a part missus Boffin laughed heartily again and her eyes glistened again and it then appeared not only that in that burst of sarcastic eloquence mister Boffin was considered by his two fellow conspirators to have outdone himself but that in his own opinion it was a remarkable achievement Never thought of it afore the moment my dear he observed to Bella When John said if he had been so happy as to win your affections and possess your heart it come into my head to turn round upon him with Win her affections and possess her heart Mew says the cat Quack quack says the duck and Bow wow wow says the dog I couldn t tell you how it come into my head or where from but it had so much the sound of a rasper that I own to you it astonished myself I was awful nigh bursting out a laughing though when it made John stare You said my pretty missus Boffin reminded Bella that there was one other thing you couldn t understand O yes cried Bella covering her face with her hands but that I never shall be able to understand as long as I live It is how John could love me so when I so little deserved it and how you mister and missus Boffin could be so forgetful of yourselves and take such pains and trouble to make me a little better and after all to help him to so unworthy a wife But I am very very grateful It was John Harmon s turn then John Harmon now for good and John Rokesmith for nevermore to plead with her quite unnecessarily in behalf of his deception and to tell her over and over again that it had been prolonged by her own winning graces in her supposed station of life This led on to many interchanges of endearment and enjoyment on all sides in the midst of which the Inexhaustible being observed staring in a most imbecile manner on missus Boffin s breast was pronounced to be supernaturally intelligent as to the whole transaction and was made to declare to the ladies and gemplemorums with a wave of the speckled fist with difficulty detached from an exceedingly short waist I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about it Then said John Harmon would missus John Harmon come and see her house And a dainty house it was and a tastefully beautiful and they went through it in procession the Inexhaustible on missus Boffin s bosom still staring occupying the middle station and mister Boffin bringing up the rear And on Bella s exquisite toilette table was an ivory casket and in the casket were jewels the like of which she had never dreamed of and aloft on an upper floor was a nursery garnished as with rainbows though we were hard put to it said John Harmon to get it done in so short a time The house inspected emissaries removed the Inexhaustible who was shortly afterwards heard screaming among the rainbows whereupon Bella withdrew herself from the presence and knowledge of gemplemorums and the screaming ceased and smiling Peace associated herself with that young olive branch Come and look in Noddy said missus Boffin to mister Boffin mister Boffin submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door looked in with immense satisfaction although there was nothing to see but Bella in a musing state of happiness seated in a little low chair upon the hearth with her child in her fair young arms and her soft eyelashes shading her eyes from the fire It looks as if the old man s spirit had found rest at last don t it said missus Boffin Yes old lady And as if his money had turned bright again after a long long rust in the dark and was at last a beginning to sparkle in the sunlight Yes old lady And it makes a pretty and a promising picter don t it Yes old lady But aware at the instant of a fine opening for a point mister Boffin quenched that observation in this delivered in the grisliest growling of the regular brown bear A pretty and a hopeful picter Mew Quack quack Bow wow And then trotted silently downstairs with his shoulders in a state of the liveliest commotion Chapter fourteen CHECKMATE TO THE FRIENDLY MOVE mister and missus John Harmon had so timed their taking possession of their rightful name and their London house that the event befel on the very day when the last waggon load of the last Mound was driven out at the gates of Boffin s Bower As it jolted away mister Wegg felt that the last load was correspondingly removed from his mind and hailed the auspicious season when that black sheep Boffin was to be closely sheared Over the whole slow process of levelling the Mounds Silas had kept watch with rapacious eyes But eyes no less rapacious had watched the growth of the Mounds in years bygone and had vigilantly sifted the dust of which they were composed No valuables turned up How should there be any seeing that the old hard jailer of Harmony Jail had coined every waif and stray into money long before Though disappointed by this bare result mister Wegg felt too sensibly relieved by the close of the labour to grumble to any great extent A foreman representative of the dust contractors purchasers of the Mounds had worn mister Wegg down to skin and bone This supervisor of the proceedings asserting his employers rights to cart off by daylight nightlight torchlight when they would must have been the death of Silas if the work had lasted much longer Seeming never to need sleep himself he would reappear with a tied up broken head in fantail hat and velveteen smalls like an accursed goblin at the most unholy and untimely hours Tired out by keeping close ward over a long day s work in fog and rain Silas would have just crawled to bed and be dozing when a horrid shake and rumble under his pillow would announce an approaching train of carts escorted by this Demon of Unrest to fall to work again At another time he would be rumbled up out of his soundest sleep in the dead of the night at another would be kept at his post eight and forty hours on end The more his persecutor besought him not to trouble himself to turn out the more suspicious was the crafty Wegg that indications had been observed of something hidden somewhere and that attempts were on foot to circumvent him So continually broken was his rest through these means that he led the life of having wagered to keep ten thousand dog watches in ten thousand hours and looked piteously upon himself as always getting up and yet never going to bed So gaunt and haggard had he grown at last that his wooden leg showed disproportionate and presented a thriving appearance in contrast with the rest of his plagued body which might almost have been termed chubby However Wegg s comfort was that all his disagreeables were now over and that he was immediately coming into his property Of late the grindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at his own nose rather than Boffin s but Boffin s nose was now to be sharpened fine Thus far mister Wegg had let his dusty friend off lightly having been baulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with him by the machinations of the sleepless dustman He had been constrained to depute mister Venus to keep their dusty friend Boffin under inspection while he himself turned lank and lean at the Bower To mister Venus s museum mister Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds were down and gone It being evening he found that gentleman as he expected seated over his fire but did not find him as he expected floating his powerful mind in tea Why you smell rather comfortable here said Wegg seeming to take it ill and stopping and sniffing as he entered I AM rather comfortable sir said Venus You don t use lemon in your business do you asked Wegg sniffing again No mister Wegg said Venus When I use it at all I mostly use it in cobblers punch What do you call cobblers punch demanded Wegg in a worse humour than before It s difficult to impart the receipt for it sir returned Venus because however particular you may be in allotting your materials so much will still depend upon the individual gifts and there being a feeling thrown into it But the groundwork is gin In a Dutch bottle said Wegg gloomily as he sat himself down Very good sir very good cried Venus Will you partake sir Will I partake returned Wegg very surlily Why of course I will WILL a man partake as has been tormented out of his five senses by an everlasting dustman with his head tied up WILL he too As if he wouldn t Don t let it put you out mister Wegg You don t seem in your usual spirits If you come to that you don t seem in your usual spirits growled Wegg You seem to be setting up for lively This circumstance appeared in his then state of mind to give mister Wegg uncommon offence And you ve been having your hair cut said Wegg missing the usual dusty shock Yes mister Wegg But don t let that put you out either And I am blest if you ain t getting fat said Wegg with culminating discontent What are you going to do next Well mister Wegg said Venus smiling in a sprightly manner I suspect you could hardly guess what I am going to do next I don t want to guess retorted Wegg All I ve got to say is that it s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been It s well for you to have had so light a part in this business when mine has been so heavy You haven t had YOUR rest broke I ll be bound Not at all sir said Venus Never rested so well in all my life I thank you Ah grumbled Wegg you should have been me If you had been me and had been fretted out of your bed and your sleep and your meals and your mind for a stretch of months together you d have been out of condition and out of sorts Certainly it has trained you down mister Wegg said Venus contemplating his figure with an artist s eye Trained you down very low it has So weazen and yellow is the kivering upon your bones that one might almost fancy you had come to give a look in upon the French gentleman in the corner instead of me mister Wegg glancing in great dudgeon towards the French gentleman s corner seemed to notice something new there which induced him to glance at the opposite corner and then to put on his glasses and stare at all the nooks and corners of the dim shop in succession Why you ve been having the place cleaned up he exclaimed Yes mister Wegg By the hand of adorable woman Then what you re going to do next I suppose is to get married That s it sir Silas took off his glasses again finding himself too intensely disgusted by the sprightly appearance of his friend and partner to bear a magnified view of him and made the inquiry To the old party mister Wegg said Venus with a sudden flush of wrath The lady in question is not a old party I meant exclaimed Wegg testily to the party as formerly objected mister Wegg said Venus in a case of so much delicacy I must trouble you to say what you mean There are strings that must not be played upon No sir Not sounded unless in the most respectful and tuneful manner Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed Then it IS the lady as formerly objected said Wegg Sir returned Venus with dignity I accept the altered phrase It is the lady as formerly objected When is it to come off asked Silas mister Wegg said Venus with another flush I cannot permit it to be put in the form of a Fight I must temperately but firmly call upon you sir to amend that question When is the lady Wegg reluctantly demanded constraining his ill temper in remembrance of the partnership and its stock in trade a going to give her and where she has already given her art Sir returned Venus I again accept the altered phrase and with pleasure The lady is a going to give her and where she has already given her art next Monday Then the lady s objection has been met said Silas mister Wegg said Venus as I did name to you I think on a former occasion if not on former occasions On former occasions interrupted Wegg What pursued Venus what the nature of the lady s objection was I may impart without violating any of the tender confidences since sprung up between the lady and myself how it has been met through the kind interference of two good friends of mine one previously acquainted with the lady and one not The pint was thrown out sir by those two friends when they did me the great service of waiting on the lady to try if a union betwixt the lady and me could not be brought to bear the pint I say was thrown out by them sir whether if after marriage I confined myself to the articulation of men children and the lower animals it might not relieve the lady s mind of her feeling respecting being as a lady regarded in a bony light It was a happy thought sir and it took root It would seem mister Venus observed Wegg with a touch of distrust that you are flush of friends Pretty well sir that gentleman answered in a tone of placid mystery So so sir Pretty well However said Wegg after eyeing him with another touch of distrust I wish you joy One man spends his fortune in one way and another in another You are going to try matrimony I mean to try travelling Indeed mister Wegg Change of air sea scenery and my natural rest I hope may bring me round after the persecutions I have undergone from the dustman with his head tied up which I just now mentioned The tough job being ended and the Mounds laid low the hour is come for Boffin to stump up Would ten to morrow morning suit you partner for finally bringing Boffin s nose to the grindstone Ten to morrow morning would quite suit mister Venus for that excellent purpose You have had him well under inspection I hope said Silas mister Venus had had him under inspection pretty well every day Suppose you was just to step round to night then and give him orders from me I say from me because he knows I won t be played with to be ready with his papers his accounts and his cash at that time in the morning said Wegg And as a matter of form which will be agreeable to your own feelings before we go out for I ll walk with you part of the way though my leg gives under me with weariness let s have a look at the stock in trade mister Venus produced it and it was perfectly correct mister Venus undertook to produce it again in the morning and to keep tryst with mister Wegg on Boffin s doorstep as the clock struck ten At a certain point of the road between Clerkenwell and Boffin s house mister Wegg expressly insisted that there should be no prefix to the Golden Dustman s name the partners separated for the night It was a very bad night to which succeeded a very bad morning The streets were so unusually slushy muddy and miserable in the morning that Wegg rode to the scene of action arguing that a man who was as it were going to the Bank to draw out a handsome property could well afford that trifling expense Venus was punctual and Wegg undertook to knock at the door and conduct the conference Door knocked at Door opened Boffin at home The servant replied that mister Boffin was at home He ll do said Wegg though it ain t what I call him The servant inquired if they had any appointment Now I tell you what young fellow said Wegg I won t have it This won t do for me I don t want menials I want Boffin They were shown into a waiting room where the all powerful Wegg wore his hat and whistled and with his forefinger stirred up a clock that stood upon the chimneypiece until he made it strike In a few minutes they were shown upstairs into what used to be Boffin s room which besides the door of entrance had folding doors in it to make it one of a suite of rooms when occasion required Here Boffin was seated at a library table and here mister Wegg having imperiously motioned the servant to withdraw drew up a chair and seated himself in his hat close beside him Here also mister Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable experience of having his hat twitched off his head and thrown out of a window which was opened and shut for the purpose Be careful what insolent liberties you take in that gentleman s presence said the owner of the hand which had done this or I will throw you after it Wegg involuntarily clapped his hand to his bare head and stared at the Secretary For it was he addressed him with a severe countenance and who had come in quietly by the folding doors Oh said Wegg as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech Very good I gave directions for YOU to be dismissed And you ain t gone ain t you Oh We ll look into this presently Very good No nor I ain t gone said another voice Somebody else had come in quietly by the folding doors Turning his head Wegg beheld his persecutor the ever wakeful dustman accoutred with fantail hat and velveteen smalls complete Who untying his tied up broken head revealed a head that was whole and a face that was Sloppy s Ha ha ha gentlemen roared Sloppy in a peal of laughter and with immeasureable relish He never thought as I could sleep standing and often done it when I turned for missus Higden He never thought as I used to give missus Higden the Police news in different voices But I did lead him a life all through it gentlemen I hope I really and truly DID Here mister Sloppy opening his mouth to a quite alarming extent and throwing back his head to peal again revealed incalculable buttons Oh said Wegg slightly discomfited but not much as yet one and one is two not dismissed is it Bof fin Just let me ask a question Who set this chap on in this dress when the carting began Who employed this fellow I say remonstrated Sloppy jerking his head forward No fellows or I ll throw you out of winder mister Boffin appeased him with a wave of his hand and said I employed him Wegg Oh You employed him Boffin Very good mister Venus we raise our terms and we can t do better than proceed to business Bof fin I want the room cleared of these two scum That s not going to be done Wegg replied mister Boffin sitting composedly on the library table at one end while the Secretary sat composedly on it at the other Bof fin Not going to be done repeated Wegg Not at your peril No Wegg said mister Boffin shaking his head good humouredly Not at my peril and not on any other terms Wegg reflected a moment and then said mister Venus will you be so good as hand me over that same dockyment Certainly sir replied Venus handing it to him with much politeness There it is Having now sir parted with it I wish to make a small observation not so much because it is anyways necessary or expresses any new doctrine or discovery as because it is a comfort to my mind Silas Wegg you are a precious old rascal mister Wegg who as if anticipating a compliment had been beating time with the paper to the other s politeness until this unexpected conclusion came upon him stopped rather abruptly Silas Wegg said Venus know that I took the liberty of taking mister Boffin into our concern as a sleeping partner at a very early period of our firm s existence Quite true added mister Boffin and I tested Venus by making him a pretended proposal or two and I found him on the whole a very honest man Wegg So mister Boffin in his indulgence is pleased to say Venus remarked though in the beginning of this dirt my hands were not for a few hours quite as clean as I could wish But I hope I made early and full amends Venus you did said mister Boffin Certainly certainly certainly Venus inclined his head with respect and gratitude Thank you sir I am much obliged to you sir for all For your good opinion now for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with you and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady both by yourself and by mister John Harmon To whom when thus making mention of him he also bowed Wegg followed the name with sharp ears and the action with sharp eyes and a certain cringing air was infusing itself into his bullying air when his attention was re claimed by Venus Everything else between you and me mister Wegg said Venus now explains itself and you can now make out sir without further words from me But totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on what I consider an important point to be made quite clear at the close of our acquaintance I beg the leave of mister Boffin and mister John Harmon to repeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing under your notice You are a precious old rascal You are a fool said Wegg with a snap of his fingers and I d have got rid of you before now if I could have struck out any way of doing it I have thought it over I can tell you You may go and welcome You leave the more for me Because you know said Wegg dividing his next observation between mister Boffin and mister Harmon I am worth my price and I mean to have it This getting off is all very well in its way and it tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one pointing out mister Venus but it won t do with a Man I am here to be bought off and I have named my figure Now buy me or leave me I ll leave you Wegg said mister Boffin laughing as far as I am concerned Bof fin replied Wegg turning upon him with a severe air I understand YOUR new born boldness I see the brass underneath YOUR silver plating YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint Knowing that you ve nothing at stake you can afford to come the independent game Why you re just so much smeary glass to see through you know But mister Harmon is in another sitiwation What mister Harmon risks is quite another pair of shoes Now I ve heerd something lately about this being mister Harmon I make out now some hints that I ve met on that subject in the newspaper and I drop you Bof fin as beneath my notice I ask mister Harmon whether he has any idea of the contents of this present paper It is a will of my late father s of more recent date than the will proved by mister Boffin address whom again as you have addressed him already and I ll knock you down leaving the whole of his property to the Crown said John Harmon with as much indifference as was compatible with extreme sternness Bight you are cried Wegg Then screwing the weight of his body upon his wooden leg and screwing his wooden head very much on one side and screwing up one eye then I put the question to you what s this paper worth Nothing said John Harmon Wegg had repeated the word with a sneer and was entering on some sarcastic retort when to his boundless amazement he found himself gripped by the cravat shaken until his teeth chattered shoved back staggering into a corner of the room and pinned there You scoundrel said John Harmon whose seafaring hold was like that of a vice You re knocking my head against the wall urged Silas faintly I mean to knock your head against the wall returned John Harmon suiting his action to his words with the heartiest good will and I d give a thousand pounds for leave to knock your brains out Listen you scoundrel and look at that Dutch bottle Sloppy held it up for his edification That Dutch bottle scoundrel contained the latest will of the many wills made by my unhappy self tormenting father That will gives everything absolutely to my noble benefactor and yours mister Boffin excluding and reviling me and my sister then already dead of a broken heart by name That Dutch bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours after he entered on possession of the estate That Dutch bottle distressed him beyond measure because though I and my sister were both no more it cast a slur upon our memory which he knew we had done nothing in our miserable youth to deserve That Dutch bottle therefore he buried in the Mound belonging to him and there it lay while you you thankless wretch were prodding and poking often very near it I dare say His intention was that it should never see the light but he was afraid to destroy it lest to destroy such a document even with his great generous motive might be an offence at law After the discovery was made here who I was mister Boffin still restless on the subject told me upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as you to appreciate the secret of that Dutch bottle I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up and the paper being legally produced and established The first thing you saw him do and the second thing has been done without your knowledge Consequently the paper now rattling in your hand as I shake you and I should like to shake the life out of you is worth less than the rotten cork of the Dutch bottle do you understand Judging from the fallen countenance of Silas as his head wagged backwards and forwards in a most uncomfortable manner he did understand Now scoundrel said John Harmon taking another sailor like turn on his cravat and holding him in his corner at arms length I shall make two more short speeches to you because I hope they will torment you Your discovery was a genuine discovery such as it was for nobody had thought of looking into that place Neither did we know you had made it until Venus spoke to mister Boffin though I kept you under good observation from my first appearance here and though Sloppy has long made it the chief occupation and delight of his life to attend you like your shadow I tell you this that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade mister Boffin to let us lead you on deluded to the last possible moment in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment That s the first short speech do you understand Here John Harmon assisted his comprehension with another shake Now scoundrel he pursued I am going to finish You supposed me just now to be the possessor of my father s property So I am But through any act of my father s or by any right I have No Through the munificence of mister Boffin The conditions that he made with me before parting with the secret of the Dutch bottle were that I should take the fortune and that he should take his Mound and no more I owe everything I possess solely to the disinterestedness uprightness tenderness goodness there are no words to satisfy me of mister and missus Boffin And when knowing what I knew I saw such a mud worm as you presume to rise in this house against this noble soul the wonder is added John Harmon through his clenched teeth and with a very ugly turn indeed on Wegg s cravat that I didn t try to twist your head off and fling THAT out of window So That s the last short speech do you understand Silas released put his hand to his throat cleared it and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region Simultaneously with this action on his part in his corner a singular and on the surface an incomprehensible movement was made by mister Sloppy who began backing towards mister Wegg along the wall in the manner of a porter or heaver who is about to lift a sack of flour or coals I am sorry Wegg said mister Boffin in his clemency that my old lady and I can t have a better opinion of you than the bad one we are forced to entertain But I shouldn t like to leave you after all said and done worse off in life than I found you Therefore say in a word before we part what it ll cost to set you up in another stall And in another place John Harmon struck in You don t come outside these windows mister Boffin returned Wegg in avaricious humiliation when I first had the honour of making your acquaintance I had got together a collection of ballads which was I may say above price Then they can t be paid for said John Harmon and you had better not try my dear sir Pardon me mister Boffin resumed Wegg with a malignant glance in the last speaker s direction I was putting the case to you who if my senses did not deceive me put the case to me I had a very choice collection of ballads and there was a new stock of gingerbread in the tin box I say no more but would rather leave it to you But it s difficult to name what s right said mister Boffin uneasily with his hand in his pocket and I don t want to go beyond what s right because you really have turned out such a very bad fellow So artful and so ungrateful you have been Wegg for when did I ever injure you There was also mister Wegg went on in a meditative manner a errand connection in which I was much respected But I would not wish to be deemed covetous and I would rather leave it to you mister Boffin Upon my word I don t know what to put it at the Golden Dustman muttered There was likewise resumed Wegg a pair of trestles for which alone a Irish person who was deemed a judge of trestles offered five and six a sum I would not hear of for I should have lost by it and there was a stool a umbrella a clothes horse and a tray But I leave it to you mister Boffin The Golden Dustman seeming to be engaged in some abstruse calculation mister Wegg assisted him with the following additional items There was further Miss Elizabeth Master George Aunt Jane and Uncle Parker Ah When a man thinks of the loss of such patronage as that when a man finds so fair a garden rooted up by pigs he finds it hard indeed without going high to work it into money But I leave it wholly to you sir mister Sloppy still continued his singular and on the surface his incomprehensible movement Leading on has been mentioned said Wegg with a melancholy air and it s not easy to say how far the tone of my mind may have been lowered by unwholesome reading on the subject of Misers when you was leading me and others on to think you one yourself sir All I can say is that I felt my tone of mind a lowering at the time And how can a man put a price upon his mind There was likewise a hat just now But I leave the ole to you mister Boffin Come said mister Boffin Here s a couple of pound In justice to myself I couldn t take it sir The words were but out of his mouth when John Harmon lifted his finger and Sloppy who was now close to Wegg backed to Wegg s back stooped grasped his coat collar behind with both hands and deftly swung him up like the sack of flour or coals before mentioned A countenance of special discontent and amazement mister Wegg exhibited in this position with his buttons almost as prominently on view as Sloppy s own and with his wooden leg in a highly unaccommodating state But not for many seconds was his countenance visible in the room for Sloppy lightly trotted out with him and trotted down the staircase mister Venus attending to open the street door mister Sloppy s instructions had been to deposit his burden in the road but a scavenger s cart happening to stand unattended at the corner with its little ladder planted against the wheel mister S found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting mister Silas Wegg into the cart s contents A somewhat difficult feat achieved with great dexterity and with a prodigious splash Chapter fifteen WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET How Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in his mind since the quiet evening when by the river side he had risen as it were out of the ashes of the Bargeman none but he could have told Not even he could have told for such misery can only be felt First he had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what he had done of that haunting reproach that he might have done it so much better and of the dread of discovery This was load enough to crush him and he laboured under it day and night It was as heavy on him in his scanty sleep as in his red eyed waking hours It bore him down with a dread unchanging monotony in which there was not a moment s variety The overweighted beast of burden or the overweighted slave can for certain instants shift the physical load and find some slight respite even in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such a limb Not even that poor mockery of relief could the wretched man obtain under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which he had entered Time went by and no visible suspicion dogged him time went by and in such public accounts of the attack as were renewed at intervals he began to see mister Lightwood who acted as lawyer for the injured man straying further from the fact going wider of the issue and evidently slackening in his zeal By degrees a glimmering of the cause of this began to break on Bradley s sight Then came the chance meeting with mister Milvey at the railway station where he often lingered in his leisure hours as a place where any fresh news of his deed would be circulated or any placard referring to it would be posted and then he saw in the light what he had brought about For then he saw that through his desperate attempt to separate those two for ever he had been made the means of uniting them That he had dipped his hands in blood to mark himself a miserable fool and tool That Eugene Wrayburn for his wife s sake set him aside and left him to crawl along his blasted course He thought of Fate or Providence or be the directing Power what it might as having put a fraud upon him overreached him and in his impotent mad rage bit and tore and had his fit New assurance of the truth came upon him in the next few following days when it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed and to whom and how though always in a dangerous condition he was a shade better Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder than he would have read that passage knowing himself spared and knowing why But not to be still further defrauded and overreached which he would be if implicated by Riderhood and punished by the law for his abject failure as though it had been a success he kept close in his school during the day ventured out warily at night and went no more to the railway station He examined the advertisements in the newspapers for any sign that Riderhood acted on his hinted threat of so summoning him to renew their acquaintance but found none Having paid him handsomely for the support and accommodation he had had at the Lock House and knowing him to be a very ignorant man who could not write he began to doubt whether he was to be feared at all or whether they need ever meet again All this time his mind was never off the rack and his raging sense of having been made to fling himself across the chasm which divided those two and bridge it over for their coming together never cooled down This horrible condition brought on other fits He could not have said how many or when but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing One winter day when a slight fall of snow was feathering the sills and frames of the schoolroom windows he stood at his black board crayon in hand about to commence with a class when reading in the countenances of those boys that there was something wrong and that they seemed in alarm for him he turned his eyes to the door towards which they faced He then saw a slouching man of forbidding appearance standing in the midst of the school with a bundle under his arm and saw that it was Riderhood He sat down on a stool which one of his boys put for him and he had a passing knowledge that he was in danger of falling and that his face was becoming distorted But the fit went off for that time and he wiped his mouth and stood up again Beg your pardon governor By your leave said Riderhood knuckling his forehead with a chuckle and a leer What place may this be This is a school Where young folks learns wot s right said Riderhood gravely nodding Beg your pardon governor By your leave But who teaches this school I do You re the master are you learned governor Yes I am the master And a lovely thing it must be said Riderhood fur to learn young folks wot s right and fur to know wot THEY know wot you do it Beg your pardon learned governor By your leave That there black board wot s it for It is for drawing on or writing on Is it though said Riderhood Who d have thought it from the looks on it WOULD you be so kind as write your name upon it learned governor In a wheedling tone Bradley hesitated for a moment but placed his usual signature enlarged upon the board I ain t a learned character myself said Riderhood surveying the class but I do admire learning in others I should dearly like to hear these here young folks read that there name off from the writing The arms of the class went up At the miserable master s nod the shrill chorus arose Bradley Headstone No cried Riderhood You don t mean it Headstone Why that s in a churchyard Hooroar for another turn Another tossing of arms another nod and another shrill chorus Bradley Headstone I ve got it now said Riderhood after attentively listening and internally repeating Bradley I see Chris en name Bradley sim lar to Roger which is my own Eh Fam ly name Headstone sim lar to Riderhood which is my own Eh Shrill chorus Yes Might you be acquainted learned governor said Riderhood with a person of about your own heighth and breadth and wot ud pull down in a scale about your own weight answering to a name sounding summat like Totherest With a desperation in him that made him perfectly quiet though his jaw was heavily squared with his eyes upon Riderhood and with traces of quickened breathing in his nostrils the schoolmaster replied in a suppressed voice after a pause I think I know the man you mean I thought you knowed the man I mean learned governor I want the man With a half glance around him at his pupils Bradley returned Do you suppose he is here Begging your pardon learned governor and by your leave said Riderhood with a laugh how could I suppose he s here when there s nobody here but you and me and these young lambs wot you re a learning on But he is most excellent company that man and I want him to come and see me at my Lock up the river I ll tell him so D ye think he ll come asked Riderhood I am sure he will Having got your word for him said Riderhood I shall count upon him P raps you d so fur obleege me learned governor as tell him that if he don t come precious soon I ll look him up He shall know it Thankee As I says a while ago pursued Riderhood changing his hoarse tone and leering round upon the class again though not a learned character my own self I do admire learning in others to be sure Being here and having met with your kind attention Master might I afore I go ask a question of these here young lambs of yourn If it is in the way of school said Bradley always sustaining his dark look at the other and speaking in his suppressed voice you may Oh It s in the way of school cried Riderhood I ll pound it Master to be in the way of school Wot s the diwisions of water my lambs Wot sorts of water is there on the land Shrill chorus Seas rivers lakes and ponds Seas rivers lakes and ponds said Riderhood They ve got all the lot Master Blowed if I shouldn t have left out lakes never having clapped eyes upon one to my knowledge Seas rivers lakes and ponds Wot is it lambs as they ketches in seas rivers lakes and ponds Shrill chorus with some contempt for the ease of the question Fish Good a gin said Riderhood But wot else is it my lambs as they sometimes ketches in rivers Chorus at a loss One shrill voice Weed Good agin cried Riderhood But it ain t weed neither You ll never guess my dears Wot is it besides fish as they sometimes ketches in rivers Well I ll tell you It s suits o clothes Bradley s face changed Leastways lambs said Riderhood observing him out of the corners of his eyes that s wot I my own self sometimes ketches in rivers For strike me blind my lambs if I didn t ketch in a river the wery bundle under my arm The class looked at the master as if appealing from the irregular entrapment of this mode of examination The master looked at the examiner as if he would have torn him to pieces I ask your pardon learned governor said Riderhood smearing his sleeve across his mouth as he laughed with a relish tain t fair to the lambs I know It wos a bit of fun of mine But upon my soul I drawed this here bundle out of a river It s a Bargeman s suit of clothes You see it had been sunk there by the man as wore it and I got it up How do you know it was sunk by the man who wore it asked Bradley Cause I see him do it said Riderhood They looked at each other Bradley slowly withdrawing his eyes turned his face to the black board and slowly wiped his name out A heap of thanks Master said Riderhood for bestowing so much of your time and of the lambses time upon a man as hasn t got no other recommendation to you than being a honest man Wishing to see at my Lock up the river the person as we ve spoke of and as you ve answered for I takes my leave of the lambs and of their learned governor both With those words he slouched out of the school leaving the master to get through his weary work as he might and leaving the whispering pupils to observe the master s face until he fell into the fit which had been long impending The next day but one was Saturday and a holiday Bradley rose early and set out on foot for Plashwater Weir Mill Lock He rose so early that it was not yet light when he began his journey Before extinguishing the candle by which he had dressed himself he made a little parcel of his decent silver watch and its decent guard and wrote inside the paper Kindly take care of these for me He then addressed the parcel to Miss Peecher and left it on the most protected corner of the little seat in her little porch It was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate and turned away The light snowfall which had feathered his schoolroom windows on the Thursday still lingered in the air and was falling white while the wind blew black The tardy day did not appear until he had been on foot two hours and had traversed a greater part of London from east to west Such breakfast as he had he took at the comfortless public house where he had parted from Riderhood on the occasion of their night walk He took it standing at the littered bar and looked loweringly at a man who stood where Riderhood had stood that early morning He outwalked the short day and was on the towing path by the river somewhat footsore when the night closed in Still two or three miles short of the Lock he slackened his pace then but went steadily on The ground was now covered with snow though thinly and there were floating lumps of ice in the more exposed parts of the river and broken sheets of ice under the shelter of the banks He took heed of nothing but the ice the snow and the distance until he saw a light ahead which he knew gleamed from the Lock House window It arrested his steps and he looked all around The ice and the snow and he and the one light had absolute possession of the dreary scene In the distance before him lay the place where he had struck the worse than useless blows that mocked him with Lizzie s presence there as Eugene s wife In the distance behind him lay the place where the children with pointing arms had seemed to devote him to the demons in crying out his name Within there where the light was was the man who as to both distances could give him up to ruin To these limits had his world shrunk He mended his pace keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange intensity as if he were taking aim at it When he approached it so nearly as that it parted into rays they seemed to fasten themselves to him and draw him on When he struck the door with his hand his foot followed so quickly on his hand that he was in the room before he was bidden to enter The light was the joint product of a fire and a candle Between the two with his feet on the iron fender sat Riderhood pipe in mouth He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in His visitor looked down with a surly nod His outer clothing removed the visitor then took a seat on the opposite side of the fire Not a smoker I think said Riderhood pushing a bottle to him across the table No They both lapsed into silence with their eyes upon the fire You don t need to be told I am here said Bradley at length Who is to begin I ll begin said Riderhood when I ve smoked this here pipe out He finished it with great deliberation knocked out the ashes on the hob and put it by I ll begin he then repeated Bradley Headstone Master if you wish it Wish it I wish to know what you want with me And so you shall Riderhood had looked hard at his hands and his pockets apparently as a precautionary measure lest he should have any weapon about him But he now leaned forward turning the collar of his waistcoat with an inquisitive finger and asked Why where s your watch I have left it behind I want it But it can be fetched I ve took a fancy to it Bradley answered with a contemptuous laugh I want it repeated Riderhood in a louder voice and I mean to have it That is what you want of me is it No said Riderhood still louder it s on y part of what I want of you I want money of you Anything else Everythink else roared Riderhood in a very loud and furious way Answer me like that and I won t talk to you at all Bradley looked at him Don t so much as look at me like that or I won t talk to you at all vociferated Riderhood But instead of talking I ll bring my hand down upon you with all its weight heavily smiting the table with great force and smash you Go on said Bradley after moistening his lips O I m a going on Don t you fear but I ll go on full fast enough for you and fur enough for you without your telling Look here Bradley Headstone Master You might have split the T other governor to chips and wedges without my caring except that I might have come upon you for a glass or so now and then Else why have to do with you at all But when you copied my clothes and when you copied my neckhankercher and when you shook blood upon me after you had done the trick you did wot I ll be paid for and paid heavy for If it come to be throw d upon you you was to be ready to throw it upon me was you Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man dressed according as described Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man as had had words with him coming through in his boat Look at the Lock keeper in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock in them same answering clothes and with that same answering red neckhankercher and see whether his clothes happens to be bloody or not Yes they do happen to be bloody Ah you sly devil Bradley very white sat looking at him in silence But two could play at your game said Riderhood snapping his fingers at him half a dozen times and I played it long ago long afore you tried your clumsy hand at it in days when you hadn t begun croaking your lecters or what not in your school I know to a figure how you done it Where you stole away I could steal away arter you and do it knowinger than you I know how you come away from London in your own clothes and where you changed your clothes and hid your clothes I see you with my own eyes take your own clothes from their hiding place among them felled trees and take a dip in the river to account for your dressing yourself to any one as might come by I see you rise up Bradley Headstone Master where you sat down Bargeman I see you pitch your Bargeman s bundle into the river I hooked your Bargeman s bundle out of the river I ve got your Bargeman s clothes tore this way and that way with the scuffle stained green with the grass and spattered all over with what bust from the blows I ve got them and I ve got you I don t care a curse for the T other governor alive or dead but I care a many curses for my own self And as you laid your plots agin me and was a sly devil agin me I ll be paid for it I ll be paid for it I ll be paid for it till I ve drained you dry Bradley looked at the fire with a working face and was silent for a while At last he said with what seemed an inconsistent composure of voice and feature You can t get blood out of a stone Riderhood I can get money out of a schoolmaster though You can t get out of me what is not in me You can t wrest from me what I have not got Mine is but a poor calling You have had more than two guineas from me already Do you know how long it has taken me allowing for a long and arduous training to earn such a sum I don t know nor I don t care Yours is a spectable calling To save your spectability it s worth your while to pawn every article of clothes you ve got sell every stick in your house and beg and borrow every penny you can get trusted with When you ve done that and handed over I ll leave you Not afore How do you mean you ll leave me I mean as I ll keep you company wherever you go when you go away from here Let the Lock take care of itself I ll take care of you once I ve got you Bradley again looked at the fire Eyeing him aside Riderhood took up his pipe refilled it lighted it and sat smoking Bradley leaned his elbows on his knees and his head upon his hands and looked at the fire with a most intent abstraction Riderhood he said raising himself in his chair after a long silence and drawing out his purse and putting it on the table Say I part with this which is all the money I have say I let you have my watch say that every quarter when I draw my salary I pay you a certain portion of it Say nothink of the sort retorted Riderhood shaking his head as he smoked You ve got away once and I won t run the chance agin I ve had trouble enough to find you and shouldn t have found you if I hadn t seen you slipping along the street overnight and watched you till you was safe housed I ll have one settlement with you for good and all Riderhood I am a man who has lived a retired life I have no resources beyond myself I have absolutely no friends That s a lie said Riderhood You ve got one friend as I knows of one as is good for a Savings Bank book or I m a blue monkey Bradley s face darkened and his hand slowly closed on the purse and drew it back as he sat listening for what the other should go on to say I went into the wrong shop fust last Thursday said Riderhood Found myself among the young ladies by George Over the young ladies I see a Missis That Missis is sweet enough upon you Master to sell herself up slap to get you out of trouble Make her do it then Bradley stared at him so very suddenly that Riderhood not quite knowing how to take it affected to be occupied with the encircling smoke from his pipe fanning it away with his hand and blowing it off You spoke to the mistress did you inquired Bradley with that former composure of voice and feature that seemed inconsistent and with averted eyes Poof Yes said Riderhood withdrawing his attention from the smoke I spoke to her I didn t say much to her She was put in a fluster by my dropping in among the young ladies I never did set up for a lady s man and she took me into her parlour to hope as there was nothink wrong I tells her O no nothink wrong The master s my wery good friend But I see how the land laid and that she was comfortable off Bradley put the purse in his pocket grasped his left wrist with his right hand and sat rigidly contemplating the fire She couldn t live more handy to you than she does said Riderhood and when I goes home with you as of course I am a going I recommend you to clean her out without loss of time You can marry her arter you and me have come to a settlement She s nice looking and I know you can t be keeping company with no one else having been so lately disapinted in another quarter Not one other word did Bradley utter all that night Not once did he change his attitude or loosen his hold upon his wrist Rigid before the fire as if it were a charmed flame that was turning him old he sat with the dark lines deepening in his face its stare becoming more and more haggard its surface turning whiter and whiter as if it were being overspread with ashes and the very texture and colour of his hair degenerating Not until the late daylight made the window transparent did this decaying statue move Then it slowly arose and sat in the window looking out Riderhood had kept his chair all night In the earlier part of the night he had muttered twice or thrice that it was bitter cold or that the fire burnt fast when he got up to mend it but as he could elicit from his companion neither sound nor movement he had afterwards held his peace He was making some disorderly preparations for coffee when Bradley came from the window and put on his outer coat and hat Hadn t us better have a bit o breakfast afore we start said Riderhood It ain t good to freeze a empty stomach Master Without a sign to show that he heard Bradley walked out of the Lock House Catching up from the table a piece of bread and taking his Bargeman s bundle under his arm Riderhood immediately followed him Bradley turned towards London Riderhood caught him up and walked at his side The two men trudged on side by side in silence full three miles Suddenly Bradley turned to retrace his course Instantly Riderhood turned likewise and they went back side by side Bradley re entered the Lock House So did Riderhood Bradley sat down in the window Riderhood warmed himself at the fire After an hour or more Bradley abruptly got up again and again went out but this time turned the other way Riderhood was close after him caught him up in a few paces and walked at his side This time as before when he found his attendant not to be shaken off Bradley suddenly turned back This time as before Riderhood turned back along with him But not this time as before did they go into the Lock House for Bradley came to a stand on the snow covered turf by the Lock looking up the river and down the river Navigation was impeded by the frost and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert Come come Master urged Riderhood at his side This is a dry game And where s the good of it You can t get rid of me except by coming to a settlement I am a going along with you wherever you go Without a word of reply Bradley passed quickly from him over the wooden bridge on the lock gates Why there s even less sense in this move than t other said Riderhood following The Weir s there and you ll have to come back you know Without taking the least notice Bradley leaned his body against a post in a resting attitude and there rested with his eyes cast down Being brought here said Riderhood gruffly I ll turn it to some use by changing my gates With a rattle and a rush of water he then swung to the lock gates that were standing open before opening the others So both sets of gates were for the moment closed You d better by far be reasonable Bradley Headstone Master said Riderhood passing him or I ll drain you all the dryer for it when we do settle Ah Would you Bradley had caught him round the body He seemed to be girdled with an iron ring They were on the brink of the Lock about midway between the two sets of gates Let go said Riderhood or I ll get my knife out and slash you wherever I can cut you Let go Bradley was drawing to the Lock edge Riderhood was drawing away from it It was a strong grapple and a fierce struggle arm and leg Bradley got him round with his back to the Lock and still worked him backward Let go said Riderhood Stop What are you trying at You can t drown Me Ain t I told you that the man as has come through drowning can never be drowned I can t be drowned I can be returned Bradley in a desperate clenched voice I am resolved to be I ll hold you living and I ll hold you dead Come down Riderhood went over into the smooth pit backward and Bradley Headstone upon him When the two were found lying under the ooze and scum behind one of the rotting gates Riderhood s hold had relaxed probably in falling and his eyes were staring upward But he was girdled still with Bradley s iron ring and the rivets of the iron ring held tight Chapter sixteen PERSONS AND THINGS IN GENERAL mister and missus John Harmon s first delightful occupation was to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong or that might could would or should have strayed in any way wrong while their name was in abeyance In tracing out affairs for which John s fictitious death was to be considered in any way responsible they used a very broad and free construction regarding for instance the dolls dressmaker as having a claim on their protection because of her association with missus Eugene Wrayburn and because of missus Eugene s old association in her turn with the dark side of the story It followed that the old man Riah as a good and serviceable friend to both was not to be disclaimed Nor even mister Inspector as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent It may be remarked in connexion with that worthy officer that a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force to the effect that he had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson over a jug of mellow flip in the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters that he didn t stand to lose a farthing through mister Harmon s coming to life but was quite as well satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered and he mister Inspector had pocketed the government reward In all their arrangements of such nature mister and missus John Harmon derived much assistance from their eminent solicitor mister Mortimer Lightwood who laid about him professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention that a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out whereby Young Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is poetically named An Eye Opener and found himself staring at real clients instead of out of window The accessibility of Riah proving very useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene s affairs Lightwood applied himself with infinite zest to attacking and harassing mister Fledgeby who discovering himself in danger of being blown into the air by certain explosive transactions in which he had been engaged and having been sufficiently flayed under his beating came to a parley and asked for quarter The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions entered into though he little thought it mister Riah unaccountably melted waited in person on him over the stable yard in Duke Street saint James s no longer ravening but mild to inform him that payment of interest as heretofore but henceforth at mister Lightwood s offices would appease his Jewish rancour and departed with the secret that mister John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor Thus was the sublime Snigsworth s wrath averted and thus did he snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace than was normally in his and the British constitution missus Wilfer s first visit to the Mendicant s bride at the new abode of Mendicancy was a grand event Pa had been sent for into the City on the very day of taking possession and had been stunned with astonishment and brought to and led about the house by one ear to behold its various treasures and had been enraptured and enchanted Pa had also been appointed Secretary and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles for ever and ever But Ma came later and came as was her due in state The carriage was sent for Ma who entered it with a bearing worthy of the occasion accompanied rather than supported by Miss Lavinia who altogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty mister George Sampson meekly followed He was received in the vehicle by missus Wilfer as if admitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family and she then issued the order Onward to the Mendicant s menial I wish to goodness Ma said Lavvy throwing herself back among the cushions with her arms crossed that you d loll a little How repeated missus Wilfer Loll Yes Ma I hope said the impressive lady I am incapable of it I am sure you look so Ma But why one should go out to dine with one s own daughter or sister as if one s under petticoat was a blackboard I do NOT understand Neither do I understand retorted missus Wilfer with deep scorn how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged I blush for you Thank you Ma said Lavvy yawning but I can do it for myself I am obliged to you when there s any occasion Here mister Sampson with the view of establishing harmony which he never under any circumstances succeeded in doing said with an agreeable smile After all you know ma am we know it s there And immediately felt that he had committed himself We know it s there said missus Wilfer glaring Really George remonstrated Miss Lavinia I must say that I don t understand your allusions and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal Go it cried mister Sampson becoming on the shortest notice a prey to despair Oh yes Go it Miss Lavinia Wilfer What you may mean George Sampson by your omnibus driving expressions I cannot pretend to imagine Neither said Miss Lavinia mister George Sampson do I wish to imagine It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to having imprudently got into a sentence without providing a way out of it Miss Lavinia was constrained to close with going to it A weak conclusion which however derived some appearance of strength from disdain Oh yes cried mister Sampson with bitterness Thus it ever is I never If you mean to say Miss Lavvy cut him short that you never brought up a young gazelle you may save yourself the trouble because nobody in this carriage supposes that you ever did We know you better As if this were a home thrust Lavinia returned mister Sampson in a dismal vein I did not mean to say so What I did mean to say was that I never expected to retain my favoured place in this family after Fortune shed her beams upon it Why do you take me said mister Sampson to the glittering halls with which I can never compete and then taunt me with my moderate salary Is it generous Is it kind The stately lady missus Wilfer perceiving her opportunity of delivering a few remarks from the throne here took up the altercation mister Sampson she began I cannot permit you to misrepresent the intentions of a child of mine Let him alone Ma Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness It is indifferent to me what he says or does Nay Lavinia quoth missus Wilfer this touches the blood of the family If mister George Sampson attributes even to my youngest daughter I don t see why you should use the word even Ma Miss Lavvy interposed because I am quite as important as any of the others Peace said missus Wilfer solemnly I repeat if mister George Sampson attributes to my youngest daughter grovelling motives he attributes them equally to the mother of my youngest daughter That mother repudiates them and demands of mister George Sampson as a youth of honour what he WOULD have I may be mistaken nothing is more likely but mister George Sampson proceeded missus Wilfer majestically waving her gloves appears to me to be seated in a first class equipage mister George Sampson appears to me to be on his way by his own admission to a residence that may be termed Palatial mister George Sampson appears to me to be invited to participate in the shall I say the Elevation which has descended on the family with which he is ambitious shall I say to Mingle Whence then this tone on mister Sampson s part It is only ma am mister Sampson explained in exceedingly low spirits because in a pecuniary sense I am painfully conscious of my unworthiness Lavinia is now highly connected Can I hope that she will still remain the same Lavinia as of old And is it not pardonable if I feel sensitive when I see a disposition on her part to take me up short If you are not satisfied with your position sir observed Miss Lavinia with much politeness we can set you down at any turning you may please to indicate to my sister s coachman Dearest Lavinia urged mister Sampson pathetically I adore you Then if you can t do it in a more agreeable manner returned the young lady I wish you wouldn t I also pursued mister Sampson respect you ma am to an extent which must ever be below your merits I am well aware but still up to an uncommon mark Bear with a wretch Lavinia bear with a wretch ma am who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him but is goaded almost to madness mister Sampson slapped his forehead when he thinks of competing with the rich and influential When you have to compete with the rich and influential it will probably be mentioned to you said Miss Lavvy in good time At least it will if the case is MY case mister Sampson immediately expressed his fervent Opinion that this was more than human and was brought upon his knees at Miss Lavinia s feet It was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both mother and daughter to bear mister Sampson a grateful captive into the glittering halls he had mentioned and to parade him through the same at once a living witness of their glory and a bright instance of their condescension Ascending the staircase Miss Lavinia permitted him to walk at her side with the air of saying Notwithstanding all these surroundings I am yours as yet George How long it may last is another question but I am yours as yet She also benignantly intimated to him aloud the nature of the objects upon which he looked and to which he was unaccustomed as Exotics George An aviary George An ormolu clock George and the like While through the whole of the decorations missus Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief who would feel himself compromised by manifesting the slightest token of surprise or admiration Indeed the bearing of this impressive woman throughout the day was a pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances She renewed the acquaintance of mister and missus Boffin as if mister and missus Boffin had said of her what she had said of them and as if Time alone could quite wear her injury out She regarded every servant who approached her as her sworn enemy expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes and to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters She sat erect at table on the right hand of her son in law as half suspecting poison in the viands and as bearing up with native force of character against other deadly ambushes Her carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position whom she had met in society a few years ago Even when slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne she related to her son in law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa she infused into the narrative such Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind since her papa s days and also of that gentleman s having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers The Inexhaustible being produced staring and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly no sooner beheld her than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable When she took her leave at last it would have been hard to say whether it was with the air of going to the scaffold herself or of leaving the inmates of the house for immediate execution Yet John Harmon enjoyed it all merrily and told his wife when he and she were alone that her natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil and that although he did not dispute her being her father s daughter he should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her mother s This visit was as has been said a grand event Another event not grand but deemed in the house a special one occurred at about the same period and this was the first interview between mister Sloppy and Miss Wren The dolls dressmaker being at work for the Inexhaustible upon a full dressed doll some two sizes larger than that young person mister Sloppy undertook to call for it and did so Come in sir said Miss Wren who was working at her bench And who may you be mister Sloppy introduced himself by name and buttons Oh indeed cried Jenny Ah I have been looking forward to knowing you I heard of your distinguishing yourself Did you Miss grinned Sloppy I am sure I am glad to hear it but I don t know how Pitching somebody into a mud cart said Miss Wren Oh That way cried Sloppy Yes Miss And threw back his head and laughed Bless us exclaimed Miss Wren with a start Don t open your mouth as wide as that young man or it ll catch so and not shut again some day mister Sloppy opened it if possible wider and kept it open until his laugh was out Why you re like the giant said Miss Wren when he came home in the land of Beanstalk and wanted Jack for supper Was he good looking Miss asked Sloppy No said Miss Wren Ugly Her visitor glanced round the room which had many comforts in it now that had not been in it before and said This is a pretty place Miss Glad you think so sir returned Miss Wren And what do you think of Me The honesty of mister Sloppy being severely taxed by the question he twisted a button grinned and faltered Out with it said Miss Wren with an arch look Don t you think me a queer little comicality In shaking her head at him after asking the question she shook her hair down Oh cried Sloppy in a burst of admiration What a lot and what a colour Miss Wren with her usual expressive hitch went on with her work But left her hair as it was not displeased by the effect it had made You don t live here alone do you Miss asked Sloppy No said Miss Wren with a chop Live here with my fairy godmother With mister Sloppy couldn t make it out with who did you say Miss Well replied Miss Wren more seriously With my second father Or with my first for that matter And she shook her head and drew a sigh If you had known a poor child I used to have here she added you d have understood me But you didn t and you can t All the better You must have been taught a long time said Sloppy glancing at the array of dolls in hand before you came to work so neatly Miss and with such a pretty taste Never was taught a stitch young man returned the dress maker tossing her head Just gobbled and gobbled till I found out how to do it Badly enough at first but better now And here have I said Sloppy in something of a self reproachful tone been a learning and a learning and here has mister Boffin been a paying and a paying ever so long I have heard what your trade is observed Miss Wren it s cabinet making mister Sloppy nodded Now that the Mounds is done with it is I ll tell you what Miss I should like to make you something Much obliged But what I could make you said Sloppy surveying the room I could make you a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers to keep your silks and threads and scraps in Or I could turn you a rare handle for that crutch stick if it belongs to him you call your father It belongs to me returned the little creature with a quick flush of her face and neck I am lame Poor Sloppy flushed too for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons and his own hand had struck it He said perhaps the best thing in the way of amends that could be said I am very glad it s yours because I d rather ornament it for you than for any one else Please may I look at it Miss Wren was in the act of handing it to him over her bench when she paused But you had better see me use it she said sharply This is the way Hoppetty Kicketty Pep peg peg Not pretty is it It seems to me that you hardly want it at all said Sloppy The little dressmaker sat down again and gave it into his hand saying with that better look upon her and with a smile Thank you And as concerning the nests and the drawers said Sloppy after measuring the handle on his sleeve and softly standing the stick aside against the wall why it would be a real pleasure to me I ve heerd tell that you can sing most beautiful and I should be better paid with a song than with any money for I always loved the likes of that and often giv missus Higden and Johnny a comic song myself with Spoken in it Though that s not your sort I ll wager You are a very kind young man returned the dressmaker a really kind young man I accept your offer I suppose He won t mind she added as an afterthought shrugging her shoulders and if he does he may Meaning him that you call your father Miss asked Sloppy No no replied Miss Wren Him Him Him Him him him repeated Sloppy staring about as if for Him Him who is coming to court and marry me returned Miss Wren Dear me how slow you are Oh HIM said Sloppy And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little troubled I never thought of him When is he coming Miss What a question cried Miss Wren How should I know Where is he coming from Miss Why good gracious how can I tell He is coming from somewhere or other I suppose and he is coming some day or other I suppose I don t know any more about him at present This tickled mister Sloppy as an extraordinarily good joke and he threw back his head and laughed with measureless enjoyment At the sight of him laughing in that absurd way the dolls dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed So they both laughed till they were tired There there there said Miss Wren For goodness sake stop Giant or I shall be swallowed up alive before I know it And to this minute you haven t said what you ve come for I have come for little Miss Harmonses doll said Sloppy I thought as much remarked Miss Wren and here is little Miss Harmonses doll waiting for you She s folded up in silver paper you see as if she was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes Take care of her and there s my hand and thank you again I ll take more care of her than if she was a gold image said Sloppy and there s both MY hands Miss and I ll soon come back again But the greatest event of all in the new life of mister and missus John Harmon was a visit from mister and missus Eugene Wrayburn Sadly wan and worn was the once gallant Eugene and walked resting on his wife s arm and leaning heavily upon a stick But he was daily growing stronger and better and it was declared by the medical attendants that he might not be much disfigured by and by It was a grand event indeed when mister and missus Eugene Wrayburn came to stay at mister and missus John Harmon s house where by the way mister and missus Boffin exquisitely happy and daily cruising about to look at shops were likewise staying indefinitely To mister Eugene Wrayburn in confidence did missus John Harmon impart what she had known of the state of his wife s affections in his reckless time And to missus John Harmon in confidence did mister Eugene Wrayburn impart that please God she should see how his wife had changed him I make no protestations said Eugene who does who means them I have made a resolution But would you believe Bella interposed his wife coming to resume her nurse s place at his side for he never got on well without her that on our wedding day he told me he almost thought the best thing he could do was to die As I didn t do it Lizzie said Eugene I ll do that better thing you suggested for your sake That same afternoon Eugene lying on his couch in his own room upstairs Lightwood came to chat with him while Bella took his wife out for a ride Nothing short of force will make her go Eugene had said so Bella had playfully forced her Dear old fellow Eugene began with Lightwood reaching up his hand you couldn t have come at a better time for my mind is full and I want to empty it First of my present before I touch upon my future M R F who is a much younger cavalier than I and a professed admirer of beauty was so affable as to remark the other day he paid us a visit of two days up the river there and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel that Lizzie ought to have her portrait painted Which coming from M R F may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic blessing You are getting well said Mortimer with a smile Really said Eugene I mean it When M R F said that and followed it up by rolling the claret for which he called and I paid in his mouth and saying My dear son why do you drink this trash it was tantamount in him to a paternal benediction on our union accompanied with a gush of tears The coolness of M R F is not to be measured by ordinary standards True enough said Lightwood That s all pursued Eugene that I shall ever hear from M R F on the subject and he will continue to saunter through the world with his hat on one side My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the family altar I have no further trouble on that score Next you really have done wonders for me Mortimer in easing my money perplexities and with such a guardian and steward beside me as the preserver of my life I am hardly strong yet you see for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice she is so inexpressibly dear to me Mortimer the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever has been It need be more for you know what it always has been in my hands Nothing Worse than nothing I fancy Eugene My own small income I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me has been an effective Something in the way of preventing me from turning to at Anything And I think yours has been much the same There spake the voice of wisdom said Eugene We are shepherds both In turning to at last we turn to in earnest Let us say no more of that for a few years to come Now I have had an idea Mortimer of taking myself and my wife to one of the colonies and working at my vocation there I should be lost without you Eugene but you may be right No said Eugene emphatically Not right Wrong He said it with such a lively almost angry flash that Mortimer showed himself greatly surprised You think this thumped head of mine is excited Eugene went on with a high look not so believe me I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of his My blood is up but wholesomely up when I think of it Tell me Shall I turn coward to Lizzie and sneak away with her as if I were ashamed of her Where would your friend s part in this world be Mortimer if she had turned coward to him and on immeasurably better occasion Honourable and stanch said Lightwood And yet Eugene And yet what Mortimer And yet are you sure that you might not feel for her sake I say for her sake any slight coldness towards her on the part of Society O You and I may well stumble at the word returned Eugene laughing Do we mean our Tippins Perhaps we do said Mortimer laughing also Faith we DO returned Eugene with great animation We may hide behind the bush and beat about it but we DO Now my wife is something nearer to my heart Mortimer than Tippins is and I owe her a little more than I owe to Tippins and I am rather prouder of her than I ever was of Tippins Therefore I will fight it out to the last gasp with her and for her here in the open field When I hide her or strike for her faint heartedly in a hole or a corner do you whom I love next best upon earth tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be told that she would have done well to turn me over with her foot that night when I lay bleeding to death and spat in my dastard face The glow that shone upon him as he spoke the words so irradiated his features that he looked for the time as though he had never been mutilated His friend responded as Eugene would have had him respond and they discoursed of the future until Lizzie came back After resuming her place at his side and tenderly touching his hands and his head she said Eugene dear you made me go out but I ought to have stayed with you You are more flushed than you have been for many days What have you been doing Nothing replied Eugene but looking forward to your coming back And talking to mister Lightwood said Lizzie turning to him with a smile But it cannot have been Society that disturbed you Faith my dear love retorted Eugene in his old airy manner as he laughed and kissed her I rather think it WAS Society though The word ran so much in Mortimer Lightwood s thoughts as he went home to the Temple that night that he resolved to take a look at Society which he had not seen for a considerable period Chapter seventeen THE VOICE OF SOCIETY Behoves Mortimer Lightwood therefore to answer a dinner card from mister and missus Veneering requesting the honour and to signify that mister Mortimer Lightwood will be happy to have the other honour The Veneerings have been as usual indefatigably dealing dinner cards to Society and whoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it for it is written in the Books of the Insolvent Fates that Veneering shall make a resounding smash next week Yes Having found out the clue to that great mystery how people can contrive to live beyond their means and having over jobbed his jobberies as legislator deputed to the Universe by the pure electors of Pocket Breaches it shall come to pass next week that Veneering will accept the Chiltern Hundreds that the legal gentleman in Britannia s confidence will again accept the Pocket Breaches Thousands and that the Veneerings will retire to Calais there to live on missus Veneering s diamonds in which mister Veneering as a good husband has from time to time invested considerable sums and to relate to Neptune and others how that before Veneering retired from Parliament the House of Commons was composed of himself and the six hundred and fifty seven dearest and oldest friends he had in the world It shall likewise come to pass at as nearly as possible the same period that Society will discover that it always did despise Veneering and distrust Veneering and that when it went to Veneering s to dinner it always had misgivings though very secretly at the time it would seem and in a perfectly private and confidential manner The next week s books of the Insolvent Fates however being not yet opened there is the usual rush to the Veneerings of the people who go to their house to dine with one another and not with them There is Lady Tippins There are Podsnap the Great and missus Podsnap There is Twemlow There are Buffer Boots and Brewer There is the Contractor who is Providence to five hundred thousand men There is the Chairman travelling three thousand miles per week There is the brilliant genius who turned the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds no shillings and nopence To whom add Mortimer Lightwood coming in among them with a reassumption of his old languid air founded on Eugene and belonging to the days when he told the story of the man from Somewhere That fresh fairy Tippins all but screams at sight of her false swain She summons the deserter to her with her fan but the deserter predetermined not to come talks Britain with Podsnap Podsnap always talks Britain and talks as if he were a sort of Private Watchman employed in the British interests against the rest of the world We know what Russia means sir says Podsnap we know what France wants we see what America is up to but we know what England is That s enough for us However when dinner is served and Lightwood drops into his old place over against Lady Tippins she can be fended off no longer Long banished Robinson Crusoe says the charmer exchanging salutations how did you leave the Island Thank you says Lightwood It made no complaint of being in pain anywhere Say how did you leave the savages asks Lady Tippins They were becoming civilized when I left Juan Fernandez says Lightwood At least they were eating one another which looked like it Tormentor returns the dear young creature You know what I mean and you trifle with my impatience Tell me something immediately about the married pair You were at the wedding Was I by the by Mortimer pretends at great leisure to consider So I was How was the bride dressed In rowing costume Mortimer looks gloomy and declines to answer I hope she steered herself skiffed herself paddled herself larboarded and starboarded herself or whatever the technical term may be to the ceremony proceeds the playful Tippins However she got to it she graced it says Mortimer Lady Tippins with a skittish little scream attracts the general attention Graced it Take care of me if I faint Veneering He means to tell us that a horrid female waterman is graceful Pardon me I mean to tell you nothing Lady Tippins replies Lightwood And keeps his word by eating his dinner with a show of the utmost indifference You shall not escape me in this way you morose backwoodsman retorts Lady Tippins You shall not evade the question to screen your friend Eugene who has made this exhibition of himself The knowledge shall be brought home to you that such a ridiculous affair is condemned by the voice of Society My dear missus Veneering do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House on the subject missus Veneering always charmed by this rattling sylph cries Oh yes Do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House So delicious Veneering says As many as are of that opinion say Aye contrary No the Ayes have it But nobody takes the slightest notice of his joke Now I am Chairwoman of Committees cries Lady Tippins What spirits she has exclaims missus Veneering to whom likewise nobody attends And this pursues the sprightly one is a Committee of the whole House to what you may call it elicit I suppose the voice of Society The question before the Committee is whether a young man of very fair family good appearance and some talent makes a fool or a wise man of himself in marrying a female waterman turned factory girl Hardly so I think the stubborn Mortimer strikes in I take the question to be whether such a man as you describe Lady Tippins does right or wrong in marrying a brave woman I say nothing of her beauty who has saved his life with a wonderful energy and address whom he knows to be virtuous and possessed of remarkable qualities whom he has long admired and who is deeply attached to him But excuse me says Podsnap with his temper and his shirt collar about equally rumpled was this young woman ever a female waterman Never But she sometimes rowed in a boat with her father I believe General sensation against the young woman Brewer shakes his head Boots shakes his head Buffer shakes his head And now mister Lightwood was she ever pursues Podsnap with his indignation rising high into those hair brushes of his a factory girl Never But she had some employment in a paper mill I believe General sensation repeated Brewer says Oh dear Boots says Oh dear Buffer says Oh dear All in a rumbling tone of protest Then all I have to say is returns Podsnap putting the thing away with his right arm that my gorge rises against such a marriage that it offends and disgusts me that it makes me sick and that I desire to know no more about it Now I wonder thinks Mortimer amused whether YOU are the Voice of Society Hear hear hear cries Lady Tippins Your opinion of this MESALLIANCE honourable colleagues of the honourable member who has just sat down missus Podsnap is of opinion that in these matters there should be an equality of station and fortune and that a man accustomed to Society should look out for a woman accustomed to Society and capable of bearing her part in it with an ease and elegance of carriage that missus Podsnap stops there delicately intimating that every such man should look out for a fine woman as nearly resembling herself as he may hope to discover Now I wonder thinks Mortimer whether you are the Voice Lady Tippins next canvasses the Contractor of five hundred thousand power It appears to this potentate that what the man in question should have done would have been to buy the young woman a boat and a small annuity and set her up for herself These things are a question of beefsteaks and porter You buy the young woman a boat Very good You buy her at the same time a small annuity You speak of that annuity in pounds sterling but it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter On the one hand the young woman has the boat On the other hand she consumes so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter Those beefsteaks and that porter are the fuel to that young woman s engine She derives therefrom a certain amount of power to row the boat that power will produce so much money you add that to the small annuity and thus you get at the young woman s income That it seems to the Contractor is the way of looking at it The fair enslaver having fallen into one of her gentle sleeps during the last exposition nobody likes to wake her Fortunately she comes awake of herself and puts the question to the Wandering Chairman The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own If such a young woman as the young woman described had saved his own life he would have been very much obliged to her wouldn t have married her and would have got her a berth in an Electric Telegraph Office where young women answer very well What does the Genius of the three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds no shillings and nopence think He can t say what he thinks without asking Had the young woman any money No says Lightwood in an uncompromising voice no money Madness and moonshine is then the compressed verdict of the Genius A man may do anything lawful for money But for no money Bosh What does Boots say Boots says he wouldn t have done it under twenty thousand pound What does Brewer say Brewer says what Boots says What does Buffer say Buffer says he knows a man who married a bathing woman and bolted Lady Tippins fancies she has collected the suffrages of the whole Committee nobody dreaming of asking the Veneerings for their opinion when looking round the table through her eyeglass she perceives mister Twemlow with his hand to his forehead Good gracious My Twemlow forgotten My dearest My own What is his vote Twemlow has the air of being ill at ease as he takes his hand from his forehead and replies I am disposed to think says he that this is a question of the feelings of a gentleman A gentleman can have no feelings who contracts such a marriage flushes Podsnap Pardon me sir says Twemlow rather less mildly than usual I don t agree with you If this gentleman s feelings of gratitude of respect of admiration and affection induced him as I presume they did to marry this lady This lady echoes Podsnap Sir returns Twemlow with his wristbands bristling a little YOU repeat the word I repeat the word This lady What else would you call her if the gentleman were present This being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap he merely waves it away with a speechless wave I say resumes Twemlow if such feelings on the part of this gentleman induced this gentleman to marry this lady I think he is the greater gentleman for the action and makes her the greater lady I beg to say that when I use the word gentleman I use it in the sense in which the degree may be attained by any man The feelings of a gentleman I hold sacred and I confess I am not comfortable when they are made the subject of sport or general discussion I should like to know sneers Podsnap whether your noble relation would be of your opinion mister Podsnap retorts Twemlow permit me He might be or he might not be I cannot say But I could not allow even him to dictate to me on a point of great delicacy on which I feel very strongly Somehow a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the company and Lady Tippins was never known to turn so very greedy or so very cross Mortimer Lightwood alone brightens He has been asking himself as to every other member of the Committee in turn I wonder whether you are the Voice But he does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has spoken and he glances in Twemlow s direction as if he were grateful When the company disperse by which time mister and missus Veneering have had quite as much as they want of the honour and the guests have had quite as much as THEY want of the other honour Mortimer sees Twemlow home shakes hands with him cordially at parting and fares to the Temple gaily POSTSCRIPT IN LIEU OF PREFACE When I devised this story I foresaw the likelihood that a class of readers and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to conceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest namely that mister John Harmon was not slain and that mister John Rokesmith was he Pleasing myself with the idea that the supposition might in part arise out of some ingenuity in the story and thinking it worth while in the interests of art to hint to an audience that an artist of whatever denomination may perhaps be trusted to know what he is about in his vocation if they will concede him a little patience I was not alarmed by the anticipation To keep for a long time unsuspected yet always working itself out another purpose originating in that leading incident and turning it to a pleasant and useful account at last was at once the most interesting and the most difficult part of my design Its difficulty was much enhanced by the mode of publication for it would be very unreasonable to expect that many readers pursuing a story in portions from month to month through nineteen months will until they have it before them complete perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole pattern which is always before the eyes of the story weaver at his loom Yet that I hold the advantages of the mode of publication to outweigh its disadvantages may be easily believed of one who revived it in the Pickwick Papers after long disuse and has pursued it ever since There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest experiences in fact Therefore I note here though it may not be at all necessary that there are hundreds of Will Cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and left uncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder mister Harmon of Harmony Jail In my social experiences since missus Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law mister friend mister Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow Putting this nonsense aside I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the one contending that there are no deserving Poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some Relieving Officers and some Union Houses the other admitting that there are such Poor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do The records in our newspapers the late exposure by THE LANCET and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences But that my view of the Poor Law may not be mistaken or misrepresented I will state it I believe there has been in England since the days of the STUARTS no law so often infamously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the Public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity and known language could say no more of their lawlessness On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year mister and missus Boffin in their manuscript dress of receiving mister and missus Lammle at breakfast were on the South Eastern Railway with me in a terribly destructive accident When I had done what I could to help others I climbed back into my carriage nearly turned over a viaduct and caught aslant upon the turn to extricate the worthy couple They were much soiled but otherwise unhurt The same happy result attended Miss Bella Wilfer on her wedding day and mister Riderhood inspecting Bradley Headstone s red neckerchief as he lay asleep I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever than I was then until there shall be written against my life the two words with which I have this day closed this book THE END September second eighteen sixty five End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Our Mutual
