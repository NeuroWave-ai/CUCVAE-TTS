6127-53038-0000	train-other-500	Oh dear oh dear fretted Nan Wallace twisting herself about uneasily on the sofa in her pretty room I never thought before that the days could be so long as they are now
6127-53038-0001	train-other-500	Poor you said her sister Maude sympathetically Maude was moving briskly about the room putting it into the beautiful order that Mother insisted on It was Nan s week to care for their room but Nan had sprained her ankle three days ago
6127-53038-0002	train-other-500	and could do nothing but lie on the sofa ever since And very tired of it too was wide awake active Nan And the picnic this afternoon too she sighed I ve looked forward to it all summer And it s a perfect day
6127-53038-0003	train-other-500	and I ve got to stay here and nurse this foot Nan looked vindictively at the bandaged member while Maude leaned out of the window to pull a pink climbing rose As she did so she nodded to someone in the village street below
6127-53038-0004	train-other-500	Who is passing asked Nan Florrie Hamilton Is she going to the picnic asked Nan indifferently No She wasn t asked Of course I don t suppose she expected to be
none	none	 She knows she isn t in our set 
6127-53038-0005	train-other-500	She must feel horribly out of place at school
none	none	 A lot of the girls say it is ridiculous of her father to send her to Miss Braxton s private school 
6127-53038-0006	train-other-500	a factory overseer s daughter She ought to have been asked to the picnic all the same said Nan shortly She is in our class if she isn t in our set Of course I don t suppose she would have enjoyed herself or even gone at all for that matter
6127-53038-0007	train-other-500	She certainly doesn t push herself in among us One would think she hadn t a tongue in her head She is the best student in the class admitted Maude arranging her roses in a vase and putting them on the table at Nan s elbow
6127-53038-0008	train-other-500	But Patty Morrison and Wilhelmina Patterson had the most to say about the invitations and they wouldn t have her There Nannie dear aren t those lovely I ll leave them here to be company for you
none	none	 I m going to have more company than that said Nan thumping her pillow energetically I m not going to mope here alone all the afternoon with you off having a jolly time at the picnic Write a little note for me to Florrie Hastings will you I ll do as much for you when you sprain your foot What shall I put in it said Maude rummaging out her portfolio obligingly Oh just ask her if she will come down and cheer a poor invalid up this afternoon 
6127-53038-0009	train-other-500	She ll come I know And she is such good company Get Dickie to run right out and mail it I do wonder if Florrie Hamilton will feel hurt over not being asked to the picnic speculated Maude absently
6127-53038-0010	train-other-500	as she slipped her note into an envelope and addressed it Florrie Hamilton herself could best have answered that question as she walked along the street in the fresh morning sunshine She did feel hurt much more keenly than she would acknowledge even to herself
none	none	 It was not that she cared about the picnic itself 
6127-53038-0011	train-other-500	as Nan Wallace had said she would not have been likely to enjoy herself if she had gone among a crowd of girls many of whom looked down on her and ignored her But to be left out when every other girl in the school was invited Florrie s lip quivered as she thought of it
none	none	 I ll get Father to let me to go to the public school after vacation she murmured 
6127-53038-0012	train-other-500	I hate going to Miss Braxton s Florrie was a newcomer in Winboro Her father had recently come to take a position in the largest factory of the small town For this reason Florrie was slighted at school by some of the ruder girls
6127-53038-0013	train-other-500	and severely left alone by most of the others Some it is true tried at the start to be friends but Florrie too keenly sensitive to the atmosphere around her to respond was believed to be decidedly dull and mopy She retreated further and further into herself
none	none	 and was almost as solitary at Miss Braxton s as if she had been on a desert island 
6127-53038-0014	train-other-500	They don t like me because I am plainly dressed and because my father is not a wealthy man thought Florrie bitterly
none	none	 And there was enough truth in this in regard to many of Miss Braxton s girls to make a very uncomfortable state of affairs Here s a letter for you Flo said her brother Jack at noon 
6127-53038-0015	train-other-500	Got it at the office on my way home Who is your swell correspondent Florrie opened the dainty perfumed note and read it with a face that puzzled at first
none	none	 suddenly grew radiant Listen Jack 
6127-53038-0016	train-other-500	she said excitedly Dear Florrie Nan is confined to house room and sofa with a sprained foot
none	none	 As she will be all alone this afternoon won t you come down and spend it with her 
6127-53038-0017	train-other-500	She very much wants you to come she is so lonesome and thinks you will be just the one to cheer her up Yours cordially Maude Wallace Are you going asked Jack Yes I don t know I ll think about it said Florrie absently Then she hurried upstairs to her room
none	none	 Shall I go she thought 
6127-53038-0018	train-other-500	Yes I will I dare say Nan has asked me just out of pity because I was not invited to the picnic But even so it was sweet of her I ve always thought I would like those Wallace girls if I could get really acquainted with them
none	none	 They ve always been nice to me too I don t know why I am always so tongue tied and stupid with them But I ll go anyway That afternoon missus Wallace came into Nan s room Nan dear Florrie Hamilton is downstairs asking for you Florrie Hamilton Yes She said something about a note you sent her this morning Shall 
6127-53038-0019	train-other-500	I ask her to come up Yes of course said Nan lamely When her mother had gone out she fell back on her pillows and thought rapidly Florrie Hamilton Maude must have addressed that note to her by mistake But she mustn t know it was a mistake mustn t suspect it
6127-53038-0020	train-other-500	Oh dear What shall I ever find to talk to her about She is so quiet and shy Further reflections were cut short by Florrie s entrance
none	none	 Nan held out her hand with a chummy smile It s good of you to give your afternoon up to visiting a cranky invalid she said heartily You don t know how lonesome I ve been since Maude went away Take off your hat and pick out the nicest chair you can find and let s be comfy 
6127-53038-0021	train-other-500	Somehow Nan s frank greeting did away with Florrie s embarrassment and made her feel at home
none	none	 She sat down in Maude s rocker then glancing over to a vase filled with roses 
6127-53038-0022	train-other-500	her eyes kindled with pleasure Seeing this Nan said Aren t they lovely We Wallaces are very fond of our climbing roses Our great grandmother brought the roots out from England with her sixty years ago and they grow nowhere else in this country
6127-53038-0023	train-other-500	I know said Florrie with a smile I recognized them as soon as I came into the room They are the same kind of roses as those which grow about Grandmother Hamilton s house in England I used to love them so In
none	none	 England Were you ever in England Oh yes laughed Florrie And I ve been in pretty nearly every other country upon earth 
6127-53038-0024	train-other-500	every one that a ship could get to at least Why Florrie Hamilton Are you in earnest Indeed yes Perhaps you don t know that our now mother as Jack says sometimes is Father s second wife My own mother died when I was a baby and my aunt
6127-53038-0025	train-other-500	who had no children of her own took me to bring up Her husband was a sea captain and she always went on his sea voyages with him So I went too I almost grew up on shipboard We had delightful times I never went to school
6127-53038-0026	train-other-500	Auntie had been a teacher before her marriage and she taught me Two years ago when I was fourteen Father married again and then he wanted me to go home to him and Jack and our new mother
none	none	 So I did although at first I was very sorry to leave Auntie and the dear old ship and all our lovely wanderings Oh tell me all about them demanded Nan 
6127-53038-0027	train-other-500	Why Florrie Hamilton to think you ve never said a word about your wonderful experiences
none	none	 I love to hear about foreign countries from people who have really been there 
6127-53038-0028	train-other-500	Please just talk and I ll listen and ask questions Florrie did talk I m not sure whether she or Nan was the more surprised to find that she could talk so well and describe her travels so brightly and humorously The afternoon passed quickly
6127-53038-0029	train-other-500	and when Florrie went away at dusk after a dainty tea served up in Nan s room it was with a cordial invitation to come again soon I ve enjoyed your visit so much said Nan sincerely
6127-53038-0030	train-other-500	I m going down to see you as soon as I can walk But don t wait for that Let us be good chummy friends without any ceremony When Florrie with a light heart and a happy smile had gone
none	none	 came Maude sunburned and glowing from her picnic Such a nice time as we had she exclaimed Wasn t I sorry to think of you cooped up here Did Florrie come One Florrie did Maude you addressed that note to Florrie Hamilton today instead of Florrie Hastings 
6127-53038-0031	train-other-500	Nan surely not I m sure Yes you did And she came here Was I not taken aback at first Maude I was thinking about her when I addressed it and I must have put her name down by mistake I m so sorry You needn t be
6127-53038-0032	train-other-500	I haven t been entertained so charmingly for a long while Why Maude she has travelled almost everywhere and is so bright and witty when she thaws out She didn t seem like the same girl at all She is just perfectly lovely
6127-53038-0033	train-other-500	Well I m glad you had such a nice time together Do you know some of the girls were very much vexed because she wasn t asked to the picnic They said that it was sheer rudeness not to ask her and that it reflected on us all even if Patty and Wilhelmina were responsible for it
6127-53038-0034	train-other-500	I m afraid we girls at Miss Braxton s have been getting snobbish and some of us are beginning to find it out and be ashamed of it Just wait until school opens said Nan vaguely enough it would seem But Maude understood
none	none	 However they did not have to wait until school opened Long before that time Winboro girlhood discovered that the Wallace girls were taking Florrie Hamilton into their lives If the Wallace girls liked her there must be something in the girl more than was at first thought thus more than one of Miss Braxton s girls reasoned And gradually the other girls found as Nan had found 
6127-53038-0035	train-other-500	that Florrie was full of fun and an all round good companion when drawn out of her diffidence When Miss Braxton s school reopened Florrie was the class favourite Between her and Nan Wallace a beautiful and helpful friendship had been formed
6127-53038-0036	train-other-500	which was to grow and deepen through their whole lives
none	none	 And all because Maude in a fit of abstraction wrote Hamilton for Hastings said Nan to herself one day But that is something Florrie Hamilton will never know An Unpremeditated Ceremony Selwyn Grant sauntered in upon the assembled family at the homestead as if he were returning from an hour s absence instead of a western sojourn of ten years Guided by the sound of voices on the still pungent autumnal air he went around to the door of the dining room which opened directly on the poppy walk in the garden Nobody noticed him for a moment and he stood in the doorway looking at them with a smile wondering what was the reason of the festal air that hung about them all as visibly as a garment His mother sat by the table industriously polishing the best silver spoons which as he remembered were only brought forth upon some great occasion Her eyes were as bright her form as erect her nose the Carston nose as pronounced and aristocratic as of yore Selwyn saw little change in her But was it possible that the tall handsome young lady with the sleek brown pompadour and a nose unmistakably and plebeianly Grant who sat by the window doing something to a heap of lace and organdy in her lap was the little curly headed sunburned sister of thirteen whom he remembered The young man leaning against the sideboard must be Leo of course a fine looking broad shouldered young fellow who made Selwyn think suddenly that he must be growing old And there was the little thin grey father in the corner peering at his newspaper with nearsighted eyes Selwyn s heart gave a bound at the sight of him which not even his mother had caused Dear old Dad The years had been kind to him missus Grant held up a glistening spoon and surveyed it complacently There I think that is bright enough even to suit Margaret Graham I shall take over the whole two dozen teas and one dozen desserts I wish Bertha that you would tie a red cord around each of the handles for me The Carmody spoons are the same pattern and I shall always be convinced that missus Carmody carried off two of ours the time that Jenny Graham was married I don t mean to take any more risks And Father Something made the mother look around and she saw her first born When the commotion was over Selwyn asked why the family spoons were being rubbed up For the wedding of course said missus Grant polishing her gold bowed spectacles and deciding that there was no more time for tears and sentiment just then And there they re not half done and we ll have to dress in another hour Bertha is no earthly use she is so taken up with her bridesmaid finery Wedding Whose wedding demanded Selwyn in bewilderment Why Leo s of course Leo is to be married tonight Didn t you get your invitation Wasn t that what brought you home Hand me a chair quick implored Selwyn Leo are you going to commit matrimony in this headlong fashion Are you sure you re grown up Six feet is a pretty good imitation of it isn t it grinned Leo Brace up old fellow It s not so bad as it might be She s quite a respectable girl We wrote you all about it three weeks ago and broke the news as gently as possible I left for the East a month ago and have been wandering around preying on old college chums ever since Haven t seen a letter There I m better now No you needn t fan me Sis Well no family can get through the world without its seasons of tribulations Who is the party of the second part little brother Alice Graham replied missus Grant who had a habit of speaking for her children none of whom had the Carston nose Alice Graham That child exclaimed Selwyn in astonishment Leo roared Come come Sel perhaps we re not very progressive here in Croyden but we don t actually stand still Girls are apt to stretch out some between ten and twenty you know You old bachelors think nobody ever grows up Why Sel you re grey around your temples Too well I know it but a man s own brother shouldn t be the first to cast such things up to him I ll admit since I come to think of it that Alice has probably grown bigger Is she any better looking than she used to be Alice is a charming girl said missus Grant impressively She is a beauty and she is also sweet and sensible which beauties are not always We are all very much pleased with Leo s choice But we have really no more time to spare just now The wedding is at seven o clock and it is four already Is there anybody you can send to the station for my luggage asked Selwyn Luckily I have a new suit otherwise I shouldn t have the face to go Well I must be off said missus Grant Father take Selwyn away so that I shan t be tempted to waste time talking to him In the library father and son looked at each other affectionately Dad it s a blessing to see you just the same I m a little dizzy with all these changes Bertha grown up and Leo within an inch of being married To Alice Graham at that whom I can t think of yet as anything else than the long legged black eyed imp of mischief she was when a kiddy To tell you the truth Dad I don t feel in a mood for going to a wedding at Wish ton wish tonight I m sure you don t either You ve always hated fusses Can t we shirk it They smiled at each other with chummy remembrance of many a family festival they had shirked together in the old days But mister Grant shook his head Not this time sonny There are some things a decent man can t shirk and one of them is his own boy s wedding It s a nuisance but I must go through with it You ll understand how it is when you re a family man yourself By the way why aren t you a family man by this time Why haven t I been put to the bother and inconvenience of attending your wedding before now son Selwyn laughed with a little vibrant note of bitterness in the laughter which the father s quick ears detected I ve been too busy with law books Dad to find me a wife mister Grant shook his bushy grey head That s not the real reason son The world has a wife for every man if he hasn t found her by the time he s thirty five there s some real reason for it Well I don t want to pry into yours but I hope it s a sound one and not a mean sneaking selfish sort of reason Perhaps you ll choose a Madam Selwyn some day yet In case you should I m going to give you a small bit of good advice Your mother now she s a splendid woman Selwyn a splendid woman She can t be matched as a housekeeper and she has improved my finances until I don t know them when I meet them She s been a good wife and a good mother If I were a young man I d court her and marry her over again that I would But son when you pick a wife pick one with a nice little commonplace nose not a family nose Never marry a woman with a family nose son A woman with a family nose came into the library at this juncture and beamed maternally upon them both There s a bite for you in the dining room After you ve eaten it you must dress Mind you brush your hair well down Father The green room is ready for you Selwyn Tomorrow I ll have a good talk with you but tonight I ll be too busy to remember you re around How are we all going to get over to Wish ton wish Leo and Bertha are going in the pony carriage It won t hold a third passenger You ll have to squeeze in with Father and me in the buggy Selwyn By no means replied Selwyn briskly I ll walk over to Wish ton wish Ifs only half a mile across lots I suppose the old way is still open It ought to be answered mister Grant drily Leo has kept it well trodden If you ve forgotten how it runs he can tell you I haven t forgotten said Selwyn a little brusquely He had his own reasons for remembering the wood path Leo had not been the first Grant to go courting to Wish ton wish When he started the moon was rising round and red and hazy in an eastern hill gap The autumn air was mild and spicy Long shadows stretched across the fields on his right and silvery mosaics patterned the floor of the old beechwood lane Selwyn walked slowly He was thinking of Esme Graham or rather of the girl who had been Esme Graham and wondering if he would see her at the wedding It was probable and he did not want to see her In spite of ten years effort he did not think he could yet look upon Tom saint Clair s wife with the proper calm indifference At the best it would taint his own memory of her he would never again be able to think of her as Esme Graham but only as Esme saint Clair The Grahams had come to Wish ton wish eleven years before There was a big family of girls of whom the tall brown haired Esme was the oldest There was one summer during which Selwyn Grant had haunted Wish ton wish the merry comrade of the younger girls the boyishly silently devoted lover of Esme Tom saint Clair had always been there too in his right as second cousin Selwyn had supposed One day he found out that Tom and Esme had been engaged ever since she was sixteen one of her sisters told him That had been all He had gone away soon after and some time later a letter from home made casual mention of Tom saint Clair s marriage He narrowly missed being late for the wedding ceremony The bridal party entered the parlour at Wish ton wish at the same moment as he slipped in by another door Selwyn almost whistled with amazement at sight of the bride That Alice Graham that tall stately blushing young woman with her masses of dead black hair frosted over by the film of wedding veil Could that be the scrawny little tomboy of ten years ago She looked not unlike Esme with that subtle family resemblance that is quite independent of feature and colouring Where was Esme Selwyn cast his eyes furtively over the assembled guests while the minister read the marriage ceremony He recognized several of the Graham girls but he did not see Esme although Tom saint Clair stout and florid and prosperous looking was standing on a chair in a faraway corner peering over the heads of the women After the turmoil of handshakings and congratulations Selwyn fled to the cool still outdoors where the rosy glow of Chinese lanterns mingled with the waves of moonshine to make fairyland And there he met her as she came out of the house by a side door a tall slender woman in some glistening clinging garment with white flowers shining like stars in the coils of her brown hair In the soft glow she looked even more beautiful than in the days of her girlhood and Selwyn s heart throbbed dangerously at sight of her Esme he said involuntarily She started and he had an idea that she changed colour although it was too dim to be sure Selwyn she exclaimed putting out her hands Why Selwyn Grant Is it really you Or are you such stuff as dreams are made of I did not know you were here I did not know you were home He caught her hands and held them tightly drawing her a little closer to him forgetting that she was Tom saint Clair s wife remembering only that she was the woman to whom he had given all his love and life s devotion to the entire beggaring of his heart I reached home only four hours ago and was haled straightway here to Leo s wedding I m dizzy Esme I can t adjust my old conceptions to this new state of affairs all at once It seems ridiculous to think that Leo and Alice are married I m sure they can t be really grown up Esme laughed as she drew away her hands We are all ten years older she said lightly Not you You are more beautiful than ever Esme That sunflower compliment is permissible in an old friend isn t it This mellow glow is kinder to me than sunlight now I am thirty you know Selwyn And I have some grey hairs he confessed I knew I had them but I had a sneaking hope that other folks didn t until Leo destroyed it today These young brothers and sisters who won t stay children are nuisances You ll be telling me next thing that Baby is grown up Baby is eighteen and has a beau laughed Esme And I give you fair warning that she insists on being called Laura now Do you want to come for a walk with me down under the beeches to the old lane gate I came out to see if the fresh air would do my bit of a headache good I shall have to help with the supper later on They went slowly across the lawn and turned into a dim moonlight lane beyond their old favourite ramble Selwyn felt like a man in a dream a pleasant dream from which he dreads to awaken The voices and laughter echoing out from the house died away behind them and the great silence of the night fell about them as they came to the old gate beyond which was a range of shining moonlight misted fields For a little while neither of them spoke The woman looked out across the white spaces and the man watched the glimmering curve of her neck and the soft darkness of her rich hair How virginal how sacred she looked The thought of Tom saint Clair was a sacrilege It s nice to see you again Selwyn said Esme frankly at last There are so few of our old set left and so many of the babies grown up Sometimes I don t know my own world it has changed so It s an uncomfortable feeling You give me a pleasant sensation of really belonging here I d be lonesome tonight if I dared I m going to miss Alice so much There will be only Mother and Baby and I left now Our family circle has dwindled woefully Mother and Baby and you Selwyn felt his head whirling again Why where is Tom He felt that it was an idiotic question but it slipped from his tongue before he could catch it Esme turned her head and looked at him wonderingly He knew that in the sunlight her eyes were as mistily blue as early meadow violets but here they looked dark and unfathomably tender Tom she said perplexedly Do you mean Tom saint Clair He is here of course he and his wife Didn t you see her That pretty woman in pale pink Lil Meredith Why you used to know Lil didn t you One of the Uxbridge Merediths To the day of his death Selwyn Grant will firmly believe that if he had not clutched fast hold of the top bar of the gate he would have tumbled down on the moss under the beeches in speechless astonishment All the surprises of that surprising evening were as nothing to this He had a swift conviction that there were no words in the English language that could fully express his feelings and that it would be a waste of time to try to find any Therefore he laid hold of the first baldly commonplace ones that came handy and said tamely I thought you were married to Tom You thought I was married to Tom repeated Esme slowly And have you thought that all these years Selwyn Grant Yes I have Is it any wonder You were engaged to Tom when I went away Jenny told me you were And a year later Bertha wrote me a letter in which she made some reference to Tom s marriage She didn t say to whom but hadn t I the right to suppose it was to you Oh The word was partly a sigh and partly a little cry of long concealed long denied pain It s been all a funny misunderstanding Tom and I were engaged once a boy and girl affair in the beginning Then we both found out that we had made a mistake that what we had thought was love was merely the affection of good comrades We broke our engagement shortly before you went away All the older girls knew it was broken but I suppose nobody mentioned the matter to Jen She was such a child we never thought about her And you ve thought I was Tom s wife all this time It s funny Funny You mean tragic Look here Esme I m not going to risk any more misunderstanding There s nothing for it but plain talk when matters get to such a state as this I love you and I ve loved you ever since I met you I went away because I could not stay here and see you married to another man I ve stayed away for the same reason Esme is it too late Did you ever care anything for me Yes I did she said slowly Do you care still he asked She hid her face against his shoulder Yes she whispered Then we ll go back to the house and be married he said joyfully Esme broke away and stared at him Married Yes married We ve wasted ten years and we re not going to waste another minute We re not I say Selwyn It s impossible I have expurgated that word from my dictionary It s the very simplest thing when you look at it in an unprejudiced way Here is a ready made wedding and decorations and assembled guests a minister on the spot and a state where no licence is required You have a very pretty new dress on and you love me I have a plain gold ring on my little finger that will fit you Aren t all the conditions fulfilled Where is the sense of waiting and having another family upheaval in a few weeks time I understand why you have made such a success of the law said Esme but There are no buts Come with me Esme I m going to hunt up your mother and mine and talk to them Half an hour later an astonishing whisper went circulating among the guests Before they could grasp its significance Tom saint Clair and Jen s husband broadly smiling were hustling scattered folk into the parlour again and making clear a passage in the hall The minister came in with his blue book and then Selwyn Grant and Esme Graham walked in hand in hand When the second ceremony was over mister Grant shook his son s hand vigorously There s no need to wish you happiness son you ve got it And you ve made one fuss and bother do for both weddings that s what I call genius And this in a careful whisper while Esme was temporarily obliterated in missus Grant s capacious embrace she s got the right sort of a nose But your mother is a grand woman son a grand woman At the Bay Shore Farm The Newburys were agog with excitement over the Governor s picnic As they talked it over on the verandah at sunset they felt that life could not be worth living to those unfortunate people who had not been invited to it Not that there were many of the latter in Claymont for it was the Governor s native village and the Claymonters were getting up the picnic for him during his political visit to the city fifteen miles away Each of the Newburys had a special reason for wishing to attend the Governor s picnic Ralph and Elliott wanted to see the Governor himself He was a pet hero of theirs Had he not once been a Claymont lad just like themselves Had he not risen to the highest office in the state by dint of sheer hard work and persistency Had he not won a national reputation by his prompt and decisive measures during the big strike at Campden And was he not a man personally and politically whom any boy might be proud to imitate Yes to all of these questions Hence to the Newbury boys the interest of the picnic centred in the Governor I shall feel two inches taller just to get a look at him said Ralph enthusiastically He isn t much to look at said Frances rather patronizingly I saw him once at Campden he came to the school when his daughter was graduated He is bald and fat Oh of course he is famous and all that But I want to go to the picnic to see Sara Beaumont She s to be there with the Chandlers from Campden and Mary Spearman who knows her by sight is going to point her out to me I suppose it would be too much to expect to be introduced to her I shall probably have to content myself with just looking at her Ralph resented hearing the Governor called bald and fat Somehow it seemed as if his hero were being reduced to the level of common clay That s like a girl he said loftily thinking more about a woman who writes books than about a man like the Governor I d rather see Sara Beaumont than forty governors retorted Frances Why she s famous and her books are perfect If I could ever hope to write anything like them It s been the dream of my life just to see her ever since I read The Story of Idlewild And now to think that it is to be fulfilled It seems too good to be true that tomorrow tomorrow Newburys I shall see Sara Beaumont Well said Cecilia gently Cecilia was always gentle even in her enthusiasm I shall like to see the Governor and Sara Beaumont too But I m going to the picnic more for the sake of seeing Nan Harris than anything else It s three years since she went away you know and I ve never had another chum whom I love so dearly I m just looking forward to meeting her and talking over all our dear good old times I do wonder if she has changed much But I am sure I shall know her By her red hair and her freckles questioned Elliott teasingly They ll be the same as ever I ll be bound Cecilia flushed and looked as angry as she could which isn t saying much after all She didn t mind when Elliott teased her about her pug nose and her big mouth but it always hurt her when he made fun of Nan Nan s family had once lived across the street from the Newburys Nan and Cecilia had been playmates all through childhood but when both girls were fourteen the Harrises had moved out west Cecilia had never seen Nan since But now the latter had come east for a visit and was with her relatives in Campden She was to be at the picnic and Cecilia s cup of delight brimmed over missus Newbury came briskly into the middle of their sunset plans She had been down to the post office and she carried an open letter in her hand Mother said Frances straightening up anxiously you have a pitying expression on your face Which of us is it for speak out don t keep us in suspense Has Mary Spearman told you that Sara Beaumont isn t going to be at the picnic Or that the Governor isn t going to be there Or that Nan Harris isn t coming Or that something s happened to put off the affair altogether cried Ralph and Cecilia and Elliott all at once missus Newbury laughed No it s none of those things And I don t know just whom I do pity but it is one of you girls This is a letter from Grandmother Newbury Tomorrow is her birthday and she wants either Frances or Cecilia to go out to Ashland on the early morning train and spend the day at the Bay Shore Farm There was silence on the verandah of the Newburys for the space of ten seconds Then Frances burst out with Mother you know neither of us can go tomorrow If it were any other day But the day of the picnic I m sorry but one of you must go said missus Newbury firmly Your father said so when I called at the store to show him the letter Grandmother Newbury would be very much hurt and displeased if her invitation were disregarded you know that But we leave it to yourselves to decide which one shall go Don t do that implored Frances miserably Pick one of us yourself pull straws anything to shorten the agony No you must settle it for yourselves said missus Newbury But in spite of herself she looked at Cecilia Cecilia was apt to be looked at someway when things were to be given up Mostly it was Cecilia who gave them up The family had come to expect it of her they all said that Cecilia was very unselfish Cecilia knew that her mother looked at her but did not turn her face She couldn t just then she looked away out over the hills and tried to swallow something that came up in her throat Glad I m not a girl said Ralph when missus Newbury had gone into the house Whew Nothing could induce me to give up that picnic not if a dozen Grandmother Newburys were offended Where s your sparkle gone now Fran It s too bad of Grandmother Newbury declared Frances angrily Oh Fran she didn t know about the picnic said Cecilia but still without turning round Well she needn t always be so annoyed if we don t go when we are invited Another day would do just as well said Frances shortly Something in her voice sounded choked too She rose and walked to the other end of the verandah where she stood and scowled down the road Ralph and Elliott feeling uncomfortable went away The verandah was very still for a little while The sun had quite set and it was growing dark when Frances came back to the steps Well what are you going to do about it she said shortly Which of us is to go to the Bay Shore I suppose I had better go said Cecilia slowly very slowly indeed Frances kicked her slippered toe against the fern jardiniere You may see Nan Harris somewhere else before she goes back she said consolingly Yes I may said Cecilia She knew quite well that she would not Nan would return to Campden on the special train and she was going back west in three days It was hard to give the picnic up but Cecilia was used to giving things up Nobody ever expected Frances to give things up she was so brilliant and popular that the good things of life came her way naturally It never seemed to matter so much about quiet Cecilia Cecilia cried herself to sleep that night She felt that it was horribly selfish of her to do so but she couldn t help it She awoke in the morning with a confused idea that it was very late Why hadn t Mary called her as she had been told to do Through the open door between her room and Frances s she could see that the latter s bed was empty Then she saw a little note addressed to her pinned on the pillow Dear Saint Cecilia it ran when you read this I shall be on the train to Ashland to spend the day with Grandmother Newbury You ve been giving up things so often and so long that I suppose you think you have a monopoly of it but you see you haven t I didn t tell you this last night because I hadn t quite made up my mind But after you went upstairs I fought it out to a finish and came to a decision Sara Beaumont would keep but Nan Harris wouldn t so you must go to the picnic I told Mary to call me instead of you this morning and now I m off You needn t spoil your fun pitying me Now that the wrench is over I feel a most delightful glow of virtuous satisfaction Fran If by running after Frances Cecilia could have brought her back Cecilia would have run But a glance at her watch told her that Frances must already be halfway to Ashland So she could only accept the situation Well anyway she thought I ll get Mary to point Sara Beaumont out to me and I ll store up a description of her in my mind to tell Fran tonight I must remember to take notice of the colour of her eyes Fran has always been exercised about that It was mid forenoon when Frances arrived at Ashland station Grandmother Newbury s man Hiram was waiting for her with the pony carriage and Frances heartily enjoyed the three mile drive to the Bay Shore Farm Grandmother Newbury came to the door to meet her granddaughter She was a tall handsome old lady with piercing black eyes and thick white hair There was no savour of the traditional grandmother of caps and knitting about her She was like a stately old princess and much as her grandchildren admired her they were decidedly in awe of her So it is Frances she said bending her head graciously that Frances might kiss her still rosy cheek I expected it would be Cecilia I heard after I had written you that there was to be a gubernatorial picnic in Claymont today so I was quite sure it would be Cecilia Why isn t it Cecilia Frances flushed a little There was a meaning tone in Grandmother Newbury s voice Cecilia was very anxious to go to the picnic today to see an old friend of hers she answered She was willing to come here but you know Grandmother that Cecilia is always willing to do the things somebody else ought to do so I decided I would stand on my rights as Miss Newbury for once and come to the Bay Shore Grandmother Newbury smiled She understood Frances had always been her favourite granddaughter but she had never been blind clear sighted old lady that she was to the little leaven of easy going selfishness in the girl s nature She was pleased to see that Frances had conquered it this time I m glad it is you who have come principally because you are cleverer than Cecilia she said brusquely Or at least you are the better talker And I want a clever girl and a good talker to help me entertain a guest today She s clever herself and she likes young girls She is a particular friend of your Uncle Robert s family down south and that is why I have asked her to spend a few days with me You ll like her Here Grandmother Newbury led Frances into the sitting room missus Kennedy this is my granddaughter Frances Newbury I told you about her and her ambitions last night You see Frances we have talked you over missus Kennedy was a much younger woman than Grandmother Newbury She was certainly no more than fifty and in spite of her grey hair looked almost girlish so bright were her dark eyes so clear cut and fresh her delicate face and so smart her general appearance Frances although not given to sudden likings took one for missus Kennedy She thought she had never seen so charming a face She found herself enjoying the day immensely In fact she forgot the Governor s picnic and Sara Beaumont altogether missus Kennedy proved to be a delightful companion She had travelled extensively and was an excellent raconteur She had seen much of men and women and crystallized her experiences into sparkling little sentences and epigrams which made Frances feel as if she were listening to one of the witty people in clever books But under all her sparkling wit there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and kind heartedness which won affection as speedily as her brilliance won admiration Frances listened and laughed and enjoyed Once she found time to think that she would have missed a great deal if she had not come to Bay Shore Farm that day Surely talking to a woman like missus Kennedy was better than looking at Sara Beaumont from a distance I ve been rewarded in the most approved storybook style she thought with amusement In the afternoon Grandmother Newbury packed missus Kennedy and Frances off for a walk The old woman wants to have her regular nap she told them Frances take missus Kennedy to the fern walk and show her the famous Newbury Bubble among the rocks I want to be rid of you both until tea time Frances and missus Kennedy went to the fern walk and the beautiful Bubble a clear round spring of amber hued water set down in a cup of rock overhung with ferns and beeches It was a spot Frances had always loved She found herself talking freely to missus Kennedy of her hopes and plans The older woman drew the girl out with tactful sympathy until she found that Frances s dearest ambition was some day to be a writer of books like Sara Beaumont Not that I expect ever to write books like hers she said hurriedly and I know it must be a long while before I can write anything worth while at all But do you think if I try hard and work hard that I might do something in this line some day I think so said missus Kennedy smiling if as you say you are willing to work hard and study hard There will be a great deal of both and many disappointments Sara Beaumont herself had a hard time at first and for a very long first too Her family was poor you know and Sara earned enough money to send away her first manuscripts by making a pot of jelly for a neighbour The manuscripts came back and Sara made more jelly and wrote more stories Still they came back Once she thought she had better give up writing stories and stick to the jelly alone There did seem some little demand for the one and none at all for the other But she determined to keep on until she either succeeded or proved to her own satisfaction that she could make better jelly than stories And you see she did succeed But it means perseverance and patience and much hard work Prepare yourself for that Frances and one day you will win your place Then you will look back to the Newbury Bubble and you will tell me what a good prophetess I was They talked longer an earnest helpful talk that went far to inspire Frances s hazy ambition with a definite purpose She understood that she must not write merely to win fame for herself or even for the higher motive of pure pleasure in her work She must aim however humbly to help her readers to higher planes of thought and endeavour Then and only then would it be worth while missus Kennedy is going to drive you to the station said Grandmother Newbury after tea I am much obliged to you Frances for giving up the picnic today and coming to the Bay Shore to gratify an old woman s inconvenient whim But I shall not burden you with too much gratitude for I think you have enjoyed yourself Indeed I have said Frances heartily Then she added with a laugh I think I would feel much more meritorious if it had not been so pleasant It has robbed me of all the self sacrificing complacency I felt this morning You see I wanted to go to that picnic to see Sara Beaumont and I felt quite like a martyr at giving it up Grandmother Newbury s eyes twinkled You would have been beautifully disappointed had you gone Sara Beaumont was not there missus Kennedy I see you haven t told our secret Frances my dear let me introduce you two over again This lady is missus Sara Beaumont Kennedy the writer of The Story of Idlewild and all those other books you so much admire The Newburys were sitting on the verandah at dusk too tired and too happy to talk Ralph and Elliott had seen the Governor more than that they had been introduced to him and he had shaken hands with them both and told them that their father and he had been chums when just their size And Cecilia had spent a whole day with Nan Harris who had not changed at all except to grow taller But there was one little cloud on her content I wanted to see Sara Beaumont to tell Frances about her but I couldn t get a glimpse of her I don t even know if she was there There comes Fran up the station road now said Ralph My eyes hasn t she a step Frances came smiling over the lawn and up the steps So you are all home safe she said gaily I hope you feasted your eyes on your beloved Governor boys I can tell that Cecilia forgathered with Nan by the beatific look on her face Oh Fran it was lovely cried Cecilia But I felt so sorry why didn t you let me go to Ashland It was too bad you missed it and Sara Beaumont Sara Beaumont was at the Bay Shore Farm said Frances I ll tell you all about it when I get my breath I ve been breathless ever since Grandmother Newbury told me of it There s only one drawback to my supreme bliss the remembrance of how complacently self sacrificing I felt this morning It humiliates me wholesomely to remember it Elizabeth s Child The Ingelows of Ingelow Grange were not a marrying family Only one of them Elizabeth had married and perhaps it was her poor match that discouraged the others At any rate Ellen and Charlotte and George Ingelow at the Grange were single and so was Paul down at Greenwood Farm It was seventeen years since Elizabeth had married James Sheldon in the face of the most decided opposition on the part of her family Sheldon was a handsome shiftless ne er do well without any violent bad habits but also without any backbone as the Ingelows declared There is sometimes hope of a man who is actively bad Charlotte Ingelow had said sententiously but who ever heard of reforming a jellyfish Elizabeth and her husband had gone west and settled on a prairie farm in Manitoba She had never been home since Perhaps her pride kept her away for she had the Ingelow share of that and she soon discovered that her family s estimate of James Sheldon had been the true one There was no active resentment on either side and once in a long while letters were exchanged Still ever since her marriage Elizabeth had been practically an outsider and an alien As the years came and went the Ingelows at home remembered only at long intervals that they had a sister on the western prairies One of these remembrances came to Charlotte Ingelow on a spring afternoon when the great orchards about the Grange were pink and white with apple and cherry blossoms and over every hill and field was a delicate flower starred green A soft breeze was blowing loose petals from the August Sweeting through the open door of the wide hall when Charlotte came through it Ellen and George were standing on the steps outside This kind of a day always makes me think of Elizabeth said Charlotte dreamily It was in apple blossom time she went away The Ingelows always spoke of Elizabeth s going away never of her marrying Seventeen years ago said Ellen Why Elizabeth s oldest child must be quite a young woman now I I a sudden idea swept over and left her a little breathless I would really like to see her Then why don t you write and ask her to come east and visit us asked George who did not often speak but who always spoke to some purpose when he did Ellen and Charlotte looked at each other I would like to see Elizabeth s child repeated Ellen firmly Do you think she would come asked Charlotte You know when James Sheldon died five years ago we wrote to Elizabeth and asked her to come home and live with us and she seemed almost resentful in the letter she wrote back I ve never said so before but I ve often thought it Yes she did said Ellen who had often thought so too but never said so Elizabeth was always very independent remarked George Perhaps she thought your letter savoured of charity or pity No Ingelow would endure that At any rate you know she refused to come even for a visit She said she could not leave the farm She may refuse to let her child come It won t do any harm to ask her said George In the end Charlotte wrote to Elizabeth and asked her to let her daughter visit the old homestead The letter was written and mailed in much perplexity and distrust when once the glow of momentary enthusiasm in the new idea had passed What if Elizabeth s child is like her father queried Charlotte in a half whisper Let us hope she won t be cried Ellen fervently Indeed she felt that a feminine edition of James Sheldon would be more than she could endure She may not like us or our ways sighed Charlotte We don t know how she has been brought up She will seem like a stranger after all I really long to see Elizabeth s child but I can t help fearing we have done a rash thing Ellen Perhaps she may not come suggested Ellen wondering whether she hoped it or feared it But Worth Sheldon did come Elizabeth wrote back a prompt acceptance with no trace of the proud bitterness that had permeated her answer to the former invitation The Ingelows at the Grange were thrown into a flutter when the letter came In another week Elizabeth s child would be with them If only she isn t like her father said Charlotte with foreboding as she aired and swept the southeast spare room for their expected guest They had three spare rooms at the Grange but the aunts had selected the southeast one for their niece because it was done in white and white seems the most appropriate for a young girl Ellen said as she arranged a pitcher of wild roses on the table I think everything is ready announced Charlotte I put the very finest sheets on the bed they smell deliciously of lavender and we had very good luck doing up the muslin curtains It is pleasant to be expecting a guest isn t it Ellen I have often thought although I have never said so before that our lives were too self centred We seemed to have no interests outside of ourselves Even Elizabeth has been really nothing to us you know She seemed to have become a stranger I hope her child will be the means of bringing us nearer together again If she has James Sheldon s round face and big blue eyes and curly yellow hair I shall never really like her no matter how Ingelowish she may be inside said Ellen decidedly When Worth Sheldon came each of her aunts drew a long breath of relief Worth was not in the least like her father in appearance Neither did she resemble her mother who had been a sprightly black haired and black eyed girl Worth was tall and straight with a long braid of thick wavy brown hair large level gazing grey eyes a square jaw and an excellent chin with a dimple in it She is the very image of Mother s sister Aunt Alice who died so long ago said Charlotte You don t remember her Ellen but I do very well She was the sweetest woman that ever drew breath She was Paul s favourite aunt too Charlotte added with a sigh Paul s antagonistic attitude was the only drawback to the joy of this meeting How delightful it would have been if he had not refused to be there too to welcome Elizabeth s child Worth came to hearts prepared to love her but they must have loved her in any case In a day Aunt Charlotte and Aunt Ellen and shy quiet Uncle George had yielded wholly to her charm She was girlishly bright and merry frankly delighted with the old homestead and the quaint old fashioned daintily kept rooms Yet there was no suggestion of gush about her she did not go into raptures but her pleasure shone out in eyes and tones There was so much to tell and ask and remember the first day that it was not until the second morning after her arrival that Worth asked the question her aunts had been dreading She asked it out in the orchard in the emerald gloom of a long arcade of stout old trees that Grandfather Ingelow had planted fifty years ago Aunt Charlotte when is Uncle Paul coming up to see me I long to see him Mother has talked so much to me about him She was his favourite sister wasn t she Charlotte and Ellen looked at each other Ellen nodded slyly It would be better to tell Worth the whole truth at once She would certainly find it out soon I do not think my dear said Aunt Charlotte quietly that your Uncle Paul will be up to see you at all Why not asked Worth her serious grey eyes looking straight into Aunt Charlotte s troubled dark ones Aunt Charlotte understood that Elizabeth had never told Worth anything about her family s resentment of her marriage It was not a pleasant thing to have to explain it all to Elizabeth s child but it must be done I think my dear she said gently that I will have to tell you a little bit of our family history that may not be very pleasant to hear or tell Perhaps you don t know that when your mother married we we did not exactly approve of her marriage Perhaps we were mistaken at any rate it was wrong and foolish to let it come between us and her as we have done But that is how it was None of us approved as I have said but none of us was so bitter as your Uncle Paul Your mother was his favourite sister and he was very deeply attached to her She was only a year younger than he When he bought the Greenwood farm she went and kept house for him for three years before her marriage When she married Paul was terribly angry He was always a strange man very determined and unyielding He said he would never forgive her and he never has He has never married and he has lived so long alone at Greenwood with only deaf old missus Bree to keep house for him that he has grown odder than ever One of us wanted to go and keep house for him but he would not let us And I must tell you this although I hate to he was very angry when he heard we had invited you to visit us and he said he would not come near the Grange as long as you were here Oh you can t realize how bitter and obstinate he is We pleaded with him but I think that only made him worse We have felt so bad over it your Aunt Ellen and your Uncle George and I but we can do nothing at all Worth had listened gravely The story was all new to her but she had long thought there must be a something at the root of her mother s indifferent relations with her old home and friends When Aunt Charlotte flushed and half tearful finished speaking a little glimmer of fun came into Worth s grey eyes and her dimple was very pronounced as she said Then if Uncle Paul will not come to see me I must go to see him My dear cried both her aunts together in dismay Aunt Ellen got her breath first Oh my dear child you must not think of such a thing she cried nervously It would never do He would I don t know what he would do order you off the premises or say something dreadful No No Wait Perhaps he will come after all we will see You must have patience Worth shook her head and the smile in her eyes deepened I don t think he will come she said Mother has told me something about the Ingelow stubbornness She says I have it in full measure but I like to call it determination it sounds so much better No the mountain will not come to Mohammed so Mohammed will go to the mountain I think I will walk down to Greenwood this afternoon There dear aunties don t look so troubled Uncle Paul won t run at me with a pitchfork will he He can t do worse than order me off his premises as you say Aunt Charlotte shook her head She understood that no argument would turn the girl from her purpose if she had the Ingelow will so she said nothing more In the afternoon Worth set out for Greenwood a mile away Oh what will Paul say exclaimed the aunts with dismal forebodings Worth met her Uncle Paul at the garden gate He was standing there when she came up the slope of the long lane a tall massive figure of a man with deep set black eyes a long prematurely white beard and a hooked nose Handsome and stubborn enough Paul Ingelow looked It was not without reason that his neighbours called him the oddest Ingelow of them all Behind him was a fine old farmhouse in beautiful grounds Worth felt almost as much interested in Greenwood as in the Grange It had been her mother s home for three years and Elizabeth Ingelow had loved it and talked much to her daughter of it Paul Ingelow did not move or speak although he probably guessed who his visitor was Worth held out her hand How do you do Uncle Paul she said Paul ignored the outstretched hand Who are you he asked gruffly I am Worth Sheldon your sister Elizabeth s daughter she answered Won t you shake hands with me Uncle Paul I have no sister Elizabeth he answered unbendingly Worth folded her hands on the gatepost and met his frowning gaze unshrinkingly Oh yes you have she said calmly You can t do away with natural ties by simply ignoring them Uncle Paul They go on existing I never knew until this morning that you were at enmity with my mother She never told me But she has talked a great deal of you to me She has told me often how much you and she loved each other and how good you always were to her She sent her love to you Years ago I had a sister Elizabeth said Paul Ingelow harshly I loved her very tenderly but she married against my will a shiftless scamp who Worth lifted her hand slightly He was my father Uncle Paul and he was always kind to me whatever his faults may have been I cannot listen to a word against him You shouldn t have come here then he said but he said it less harshly There was even a certain reluctant approval of this composed independent niece in his eyes Didn t they tell you at the Grange that I didn t want to see you Yes they told me this morning but I wanted to see you so I came Why cannot we be friends Uncle Paul not because we are uncle and niece but simply because you are you and I am I Let us leave my father and mother out of the question and start fair on our own account For a moment Uncle Paul looked at her She met his gaze frankly and firmly with a merry smile lurking in her eyes Then he threw back his head and laughed a hearty laugh that was good to hear Very well he said It is a bargain He put his hand over the gate and shook hers Then he opened the gate and invited her into the house Worth stayed to tea and Uncle Paul showed her all over Greenwood You are to come here as often as you like he told her When a young lady and I make a compact of friendship I am going to live up to it But you are not to talk to me about your mother Remember we are friends because I am I and you are you and there is no question of anybody else The Grange Ingelows were amazed to see Paul bringing Worth home in his buggy that evening When Worth had gone into the house Charlotte told him that she was glad to see that he had relented towards Elizabeth s child I have not he made stern answer I don t know whom you mean by Elizabeth s child That young woman and I have taken a liking for each other which we mean to cultivate on our own account Don t call her Elizabeth s child to me again As the days and weeks went by Worth grew dearer and dearer to the Grange folk The aunts often wondered to themselves how they had existed before Worth came and oftener yet how they could do without her when the time came for her to go home Meanwhile the odd friendship between her and Uncle Paul deepened and grew They read and drove and walked together Worth spent half her time at Greenwood Once Uncle Paul said to her as if speaking half to himself To think that James Sheldon could have a daughter like you Up went Worth s head Worth s grey eyes flashed I thought we were not to speak of my parents she said You ought not to have been the first to break the compact Uncle Paul I accept the rebuke and beg your pardon he said He liked her all the better for those little flashes of spirit across her girlish composure One day in September they were together in the garden at Greenwood Worth looking lovingly and regretfully down the sun flecked avenue of box said with a sigh Next month I must go home How sorry I shall be to leave the Grange and Greenwood I have had such a delightful summer and I have learned to love all the old nooks and corners as well as if I had lived here all my life Stay here said Uncle Paul abruptly Stay here with me I want you Worth Let Greenwood be your home henceforth and adopt your crusty old bachelor uncle for a father Oh Uncle Paul cried Worth I don t know I don t think oh you surprise me I surprise myself perhaps But I mean it Worth I am a rich lonely old man and I want to keep this new interest you have brought into my life Stay with me I will try to give you a very happy life my child and all I have shall be yours Seeing her troubled face he added There I don t ask you to decide right here I suppose you have other claims to adjust Take time to think it over Thank you said Worth She went back to the Grange as one in a dream and shut herself up in the white southeast room to think She knew that she wanted to accept this unexpected offer of Uncle Paul s Worth s loyal tongue had never betrayed even to the loving aunts any discontent in the prairie farm life that had always been hers But it had been a hard life for the girl narrow and poverty bounded She longed to put forth her hand and take this other life which opened so temptingly before her She knew too that her mother ambitious for her child would not be likely to interpose any objections She had only to go to Uncle Paul and all that she longed for would be given her together with the faithful protecting fatherly love and care that in all its strength and sweetness had never been hers She must decide for herself Not even of Aunt Charlotte or Aunt Ellen could she ask advice She knew they would entreat her to accept and she needed no such incentive to her own wishes Far on into the night Worth sat at the white curtained dormer window looking at the stars over the apple trees and fighting her battle between inclination and duty It was a hard and stubbornly contested battle but with that square chin and those unfaltering grey eyes it could end in only one way Next day Worth went down to Greenwood Well what is it to be said Uncle Paul without preface as he met her in the garden I cannot come Uncle Paul said Worth steadily I cannot give up my mother I don t ask you to give her up he said gruffly You can write to her and visit her I don t want to come between parent and child That isn t the point exactly Uncle Paul I hope you will not be angry with me for not accepting your offer I wanted to you don t know how much I wanted to but I cannot Mother and I are so much to each other Uncle Paul more I am sure than even most mothers and daughters You have never let me speak of her but I must tell you this Mother has often told me that when I came to her things were going very hard with her and that I was heaven s own gift to comfort and encourage her Then in the ten years that followed the three other babies that came to her all died before they were two years old And with each loss Mother said I grew dearer to her Don t you see Uncle Paul I m not merely just one child to her but I m all those children Six years ago the twins were born and they are dear bright little lads but they are very small yet so Mother has really nobody but me I know she would consent to let me stay here because she would think it best for me but it wouldn t be really best for me it couldn t be best for a girl to do what wasn t right I love you Uncle Paul and I love Greenwood and I want to stay so much but I cannot I have thought it all over and I must go back to Mother Uncle Paul did not say one word He turned his back on Worth and walked the full length of the box alley twice Worth watched him wistfully Was he very angry Would he forgive her You are an Ingelow Worth he said when he came back That was all but Worth understood that her decision was not to cause any estrangement between them A month later Worth s last day at the Grange came She was to leave for the West the next morning They were all out in Grandfather Ingelow s arcade Uncle George and Aunt Charlotte and Aunt Ellen and Worth enjoying the ripe mellow sunshine of the October day when Paul Ingelow came up the slope Worth went to meet him with outstretched hands He took them both in his and looked at her very gravely I have not come to say goodbye Worth I will not say it You are coming back to me Worth shook her brown head sadly Oh I cannot Uncle Paul You know I told you Yes I know he interrupted I have been thinking it all over every day since You know yourself what the Ingelow determination is It s a good thing in a good cause but a bad thing in a bad one And it is no easy thing to conquer when you ve let it rule you for years as I have done But I have conquered it or you have conquered it for me Child here is a letter It is to your mother my sister Elizabeth In it I have asked her to forgive me and to forget our long estrangement I have asked her to come back to me with you and her boys I want you all all at Greenwood and I will do the best I can for you all Oh Uncle Paul cried Worth her face aglow and quivering with smiles and tears and sunshine Do you think she will forgive me and come I know she will cried Worth I know how she has longed for you and home Oh I am so happy Uncle Paul He smiled at her and put his arm over her shoulder Together they walked up the golden arcade to tell the others That night Charlotte and Ellen cried with happiness as they talked it over in the twilight How beautiful murmured Charlotte softly We shall not lose Worth after all Ellen I could not have borne it to see that girl go utterly out of our lives again I always hoped and believed that Elizabeth s child would somehow bring us all together again said Ellen happily Freda s Adopted Grave North Point where Freda lived was the bleakest settlement in the world Even its inhabitants who loved it had to admit that The northeast winds swept whistling up the bay and blew rawly over the long hill that sloped down to it blighting everything that was in their way Only the sturdy firs and spruces could hold their own against it So there were no orchards or groves or flower gardens in North Point Just over the hill in a sheltered southwest valley was the North Point church with the graveyard behind it and this graveyard was the most beautiful spot in North Point or near it The North Point folk loved flowers They could not have them about their homes so they had them in their graveyard It was a matter of pride with each family to keep the separate plot neatly trimmed and weeded and adorned with beautiful blossoms It was one of the unwritten laws of the little community that on some selected day in May everybody would repair to the graveyard to plant trim and clip It was not an unpleasant duty even to those whose sorrow was fresh It seemed as if they were still doing something for the friends who had gone when they made their earthly resting places beautiful As for the children they looked forward to Graveyard Day as a very delightful anniversary and it divided its spring honours with the amount of the herring catch Tomorrow is Graveyard Day said Minnie Hutchinson at school recess when all the little girls were sitting on the fence Ain t I glad I ve got the loveliest big white rosebush to plant by Grandma Hutchinson s grave Uncle Robert sent it out from town My mother has ten tuberoses to set out said Nan Gray proudly We re going to plant a row of lilies right around our plot said Katie Morris Every little girl had some boast to make that is every little girl but Freda Freda sat in a corner all by herself and felt miserably outside of everything She had no part or lot in Graveyard Day Are you going to plant anything Freda asked Nan with a wink at the others Freda shook her head mutely Freda can t plant anything said Winnie Bell cruelly although she did not mean to be cruel She hasn t got a grave Just then Freda felt as if her gravelessness were a positive disgrace and crime as if not to have an interest in a single grave in North Point cemetery branded you as an outcast forever and ever It very nearly did in North Point The other little girls pitied Freda but at the same time they rather looked down upon her for it with the complacency of those who had been born into a good heritage of family graves and had an undisputed right to celebrate Graveyard Day Freda felt that her cup of wretchedness was full She sat miserably on the fence while the other girls ran off to play and she walked home alone at night It seemed to her that she could not bear it any longer Freda was ten years old Four years ago missus Wilson had taken her from the orphan asylum in town missus Wilson lived just this side of the hill from the graveyard and everybody in North Point called her a crank They pitied any child she took they said It would be worked to death and treated like a slave At first they tried to pump Freda concerning missus Wilson s treatment of her but Freda was not to be pumped She was a quiet little mite with big wistful dark eyes that had a disconcerting fashion of looking the gossips out of countenance But if Freda had been disposed to complain the North Point people would have found out that they had been only too correct in their predictions missus Wilson Freda said timidly that night why haven t we got a grave missus Wilson averred that such a question gave her the creeps You ought to be very thankful that we haven t she said severely That Graveyard Day is a heathenish custom anyhow They make a regular picnic of it and it makes me sick to hear those school girls chattering about what they mean to plant each one trying to outblow the other If I had a grave there I wouldn t make a flower garden of it Freda did not go to the graveyard the next day although it was a holiday But in the evening when everybody had gone home she crept over the hill and through the beech grove to see what had been done The plots were all very neat and prettily set out with plants and bulbs Some perennials were already in bud The grave of Katie Morris great uncle who had been dead for forty years was covered with blossoming purple pansies Every grave no matter how small or old had its share of promise every grave except one Freda came across it with a feeling of surprise It was away down in the lower corner where there were no plots It was shut off from the others by a growth of young poplars and was sunken and overgrown with blueberry shrubs There was no headstone and it looked dismally neglected Freda felt a sympathy for it She had no grave and this grave had nobody to tend it or care for it When she went home she asked missus Wilson whose it was Humph said missus Wilson If you have so much spare time lying round loose you d better put it into your sewing instead of prowling about graveyards Do you expect me to work my fingers to the bone making clothes for you I wish I d left you in the asylum That grave is Jordan Slade s I suppose He died twenty years ago and a worthless drunken scamp he was He served a term in the penitentiary for breaking into Andrew Messervey s store and after it he had the face to come back to North Point But respectable people would have nothing to do with him and he went to the dogs altogether had to be buried on charity when he died He hasn t any relations here There was a sister a little girl of ten who used to live with the Cogswells over at East Point After Jord died some rich folks saw her and was so struck with her good looks that they took her away with them I don t know what become of her and I don t care Go and bring the cows up When Freda went to bed that night her mind was made up She would adopt Jordan Slade s grave Thereafter Freda spent her few precious spare time moments in the graveyard She clipped the blueberry shrubs and long tangled grasses from the grave with a pair of rusty old shears that blistered her little brown hands badly She brought ferns from the woods to plant about it She begged a root of heliotrope from Nan Gray a clump of day lilies from Katie Morris a rosebush slip from Nellie Bell some pansy seed from old missus Bennett and a geranium shoot from Minnie Hutchinson s big sister She planted weeded and watered faithfully and her efforts were rewarded Her grave soon looked as nice as any in the graveyard Nobody but Freda knew about it The poplar growth concealed the corner from sight and everybody had quite forgotten poor disreputable Jordan Slade s grave At least it seemed as if everybody had But one evening when Freda slipped down to the graveyard with a little can of water and rounded the corner of the poplars she saw a lady standing by the grave a strange lady dressed in black with the loveliest face Freda had ever seen and tears in her eyes The lady gave a little start when she saw Freda with her can of water Can you tell me who has been looking after this grave she said It it was I faltered Freda wondering if the lady would be angry with her Pleas m it was I but I didn t mean any harm All the other little girls had a grave and I hadn t any so I just adopted this one Did you know whose it was asked the lady gently Yes m Jordan Slade s missus Wilson told me Jordan Slade was my brother said the lady He went sadly astray but he was not all bad He was weak and too easily influenced But whatever his faults he was good and kind oh so good and kind to me when I was a child I loved him with all my heart It has always been my wish to come back and visit his grave but I have never been able to come my home has been so far away I expected to find it neglected I cannot tell you how pleased and touched I am to find it kept so beautifully Thank you over and over again my dear child Then you re not cross ma am said Freda eagerly And I may go on looking after it may I Oh it just seems as if I couldn t bear not to You may look after it as long as you want to my dear I will help you too I am to be at East Point all summer This will be our grave yours and mine That summer was a wonderful one for Freda She had found a firm friend in missus Halliday The latter was a wealthy woman Her husband had died a short time previously and she had no children When she went away in the fall Freda went with her to be her own little girl for always missus Wilson consented grudgingly to give Freda up although she grumbled a great deal about ingratitude Before they went they paid a farewell visit to their grave missus Halliday had arranged with some of the North Point people to keep it well attended to but Freda cried at leaving it Don t feel badly about it dear comforted missus Halliday We are coming back every summer to see it It will always be our grave Freda slipped her hand into missus Halliday s and smiled up at her I d never have found you Aunty if it hadn t been for this grave she said happily I m so glad I adopted it How Don Was Saved Will Barrie went whistling down the lane of the Locksley farm took a short cut over a field of clover aftermath and through a sloping orchard where the trees were laden with apples and emerged into the farmhouse yard where Curtis Locksley was sitting on a pile of logs idly whittling at a stick You look as if you had a corner in time Curt said Will I call that luck for I want you to go chestnutting up to Grier s Hill with me I met old Tom Grier on the road yesterday and he told me I might go any day Nice old man Tom Grier Good said Curtis heartily as he sprang up If I haven t exactly a corner in time I have a day off at least Uncle doesn t need me today Wait till I whistle for Don May as well take him with us Curtis whistled accordingly but Don his handsome Newfoundland dog did not appear After calling and whistling about the yard and barns for several minutes Curtis turned away disappointedly He can t be anywhere around It is very strange Don never used to go away from home without me but lately he has been missing several times and twice last week he wasn t here in the morning and didn t turn up until midday I d keep him shut up until I broke him of the habit of playing truant if I were you said Will as they turned into the lane Don hates to be shut up howls all the time so mournfully that I can t stand it responded Curtis Well said Will hesitatingly maybe that would be better after all than letting him stray away with other dogs who may teach him bad habits I saw Don myself one evening last week ambling down the Harbour road with that big brown dog of Sam Ventnor s Ventnor s dog is beginning to have a bad reputation you know There have been several sheep worried lately and Don wouldn t touch a sheep interrupted Curtis hotly I daresay not not yet But Ventnor s dog is under suspicion and if Don runs with him he ll learn the trick sure as preaching The farmers are growling a good bit already and if they hear of Don and Ventnor s dog going about in company they ll put it on them both Better keep Don shut up awhile let him howl as he likes I believe I will said Curtis soberly I don t want Don to fall under suspicion of sheep worrying though I m sure he would never do it Anyhow I don t want him to run with Ventnor s dog I ll chain him up in the barn when I go home I couldn t stand it if anything happened to Don After you he s the only chum I ve got and he s a good one Will agreed He was almost as fond of Don as Curtis was But he did not feel so sure that the dog would not worry a sheep Will knew that Don was suspected already but he did not like to tell Curtis so And of course there was as yet no positive proof merely mutterings and suggestions among the Bayside farmers who had lost sheep and were anxious to locate their slayer There were many other dogs in Bayside and the surrounding districts who were just as likely to be the guilty animals and Will hoped that if Don were shut up for a time suspicion might be averted from him especially if the worryings still went on He had felt a little doubtful about hinting the truth to Curtis who was a high spirited lad and always resented any slur cast upon Don much more bitterly than if it were meant for himself But he knew that Curtis would take it better from him than from the other Bayside boys one or the other of whom would be sure soon to cast something up to Curtis about his dog Will felt decidedly relieved to find that Curtis took his advice in the spirit in which it was offered Who have lost sheep lately queried Curtis as they left the main road and struck into a wood path through the ranks of beeches on Tom Grier s land Nearly everybody on the Hollow farms answered Will Until last week nobody on the Hill farms had lost any But Tuesday night old Paul Stockton had six fine sheep killed in his upland pasture behind the fir woods He is furious about it I believe and vows he ll find out what dog did it and have him shot Curtis looked grave Paul Stockton s farm was only about a quarter of a mile from the Locksley homestead and he knew that Paul had an old family grudge against his Uncle Arnold which included his nephew and all belonging to him Moreover Curtis remembered with a sinking heart that Wednesday morning had been one of the mornings upon which Don was missing But I don t care he thought miserably I know Don didn t kill those sheep Talking of old Paul said Will who thought it advisable to turn the conversation reminds me that they are getting anxious at the Harbour about George Finley s schooner the Amy Reade She was due three days ago and there s no sign of her yet And there have been two bad gales since she left Morro Oscar Stockton is on board of her you know and his father is worried about him There are five other men on her all from the Harbour and their folks down there are pretty wild about the schooner Nothing more was said about the sheep and soon in the pleasures of chestnutting Curtis forgot his anxiety Old Tom Grier had called to the boys as they passed his house to come back and have dinner there when the time came This they did and it was late in the afternoon when Curtis with his bag of chestnuts over his shoulder walked into the Locksley yard His uncle was standing before the open barn doors talking to an elderly grizzled man with a thin shrewd face Curtis s heart sank as he recognized old Paul Stockton What could have brought him over Curtis called his uncle come here As Curtis crossed the yard Don came bounding down the slope from the house to meet him He put his hand on the dog s big head and the two of them walked slowly to the barn Old Paul included them both in a vindictive scowl Curtis said his uncle gravely here s a bad business mister Stockton tells me that your dog has been worrying his sheep It s a began Curtis angrily Then he checked himself and went on more calmly That can t be so mister Stockton My dog would not harm anything He killed or helped to kill six of the finest sheep in my flock retorted old Paul What proof have you of it demanded Curtis trying to keep his anger within bounds Abner Peck saw your dog and Ventnor s running together through my sheep pasture at sundown on Tuesday evening answered old Paul Wednesday morning I found this in the corner of the pasture where the sheep were worried Your uncle admits that it was tied around your dog s neck on Tuesday And old Paul held out triumphantly a faded red ribbon Curtis recognized it at a glance It was the ribbon his little cousin Lena had tied around Don s neck Tuesday afternoon He remembered how they had laughed at the effect of that frivolous red collar and bow on Don s massive body I m sure Don isn t guilty he cried passionately mister Locksley shook his head I m afraid he is Curtis The case looks very black against him and sheep stealing is a serious offence The dog must be shot said old Paul decidedly I leave the matter in your hands mister Locksley I ve got enough proof to convict the dog and if you don t have him killed I ll make you pay for the sheep he worried As old Paul strode away Curtis looked beseechingly at his uncle Don mustn t be shot Uncle he said desperately I ll chain him up all the time And have him howling night and day as if we had a brood of banshees about the place said mister Locksley sarcastically He was a stern man with little sentiment in his nature and no understanding whatever of Curtis s affection for Don The Bayside people said that Arnold Locksley had always been very severe with his nephew No no Curtis you must look at the matter sensibly The dog is a nuisance and must be shot You can t keep him shut up forever and if he has once learned the trick of sheep worrying he will never forget it You can get another dog if you must have one I ll get Charles Pippey to come and shoot Don tomorrow No sulking now Curtis You are too big a boy for that Tie the dog up for the night and then go and put the calves in There is a storm coming The wind is blowing hard from the northeast now His uncle walked away leaving the boy white and miserable in the yard He looked at Don who sat on his haunches and returned his gaze frankly and open heartedly He did not look like a guilty dog Could it be possible that he had really worried those sheep I ll never believe it of you old fellow Curtis said as he led the dog into a corner of the carriage house and tied him up there Then he flung himself down on a pile of sacks beside him and buried his face in Don s curly black fur The boy felt sullen rebellious and wretched He lay there until dark thinking his own bitter thoughts and listening to the rapidly increasing gale Finally he got up and flung off after the calves with Don s melancholy howls at finding himself deserted ringing in his ears He ll be quiet enough tomorrow night thought Curtis wretchedly as he went upstairs to bed after housing the calves For a long while he lay awake but finally dropped into a heavy slumber which lasted until his aunt called him for milking The wind was blowing more furiously than ever Up over the fields came the roar and crash of the surges on the outside shore The Harbour to the east of Bayside was rough and stormy They were just rising from breakfast when Will Barrie burst into the kitchen The Amy Reade is ashore on Gleeson s rocks he shouted Struck there at daylight this morning Come on Curt Curtis sprang for his cap his uncle following suit more deliberately As the two boys ran through the yard Curtis heard Don howling I ll take him with me he muttered Wait a minute Will The Harbour road was thronged with people hurrying to the outside shore for the news of the Amy Readers disaster had spread rapidly As the boys with the rejoicing Don at their heels pelted along Sam Morrow overtook them in a cart and told them to jump in Sam had already been down to the shore and had gone back to tell his father As they jolted along he screamed information at them over the shriek of the gale Bad business this She s pounding on a reef bout a quarter of a mile out They re sure she s going to break up old tub you know leaky rotten The sea s tremenjus high and the surfs going dean over her There can t be no boat launched for hours yet they ll all be drowned Old Paul s down there like a madman offering everything he s got to the man who ll save Oscar but it can t be done By this time they had reached the shore which was black with excited people Out on Gleeson s Reef the ill fated little schooner was visible amid the flying spray A grizzled old Harbour fisherman to whom Sam shouted a question shook his head No can t do nothin No boat c d live in that surf f r a moment The schooner ll go to pieces mighty soon I m feared It s turrible turrible to stan by an watch yer neighbours drown like this Curtis and Will elbowed their way down to the water s edge The relatives of the crew were all there in various stages of despair but old Paul Stockton seemed like a man demented He ran up and down the beach crying and praying His only son was on the Amy Reade and he could do nothing to save him What are they doing asked Will of Martin Clark Trying to get a line ashore by throwing out a small rope with a stick tied to it answered Martin It s young Stockton that s trying now But it isn t any use The cross currents on that reef are too powerful Why Don will bring that line ashore exclaimed Curtis Here Don Don I say The dog bounded back along the shore with a quick bark Curtis grasped him by the collar and pointed to the stick which young Stockton had just hurled again into the water Don with another bark of comprehension dashed into the sea The onlookers grasping the situation gave a cheer and then relapsed into silence Only the shriek of the gale and the crash of the waves could be heard as they watched the magnificent dog swimming out through the breakers his big black head now rising on the crest of a wave and now disappearing in the hollow behind it When Don finally reached the tossing stick grasped it in his mouth and turned shoreward another great shout went up from the beach A woman behind Curtis whose husband was on the schooner dropped on her knees on the pebbles sobbing and thanking God Curtis himself felt the stinging tears start to his eyes When Don reached the shore he dropped the stick at Curtis s feet and gave himself a tremendous shake Curtis caught at the stick while a dozen men and women threw themselves bodily on Don hugging him and kissing his wet fur like distracted creatures Old Paul Stockton was among them Over his shoulder Don s big black head looked up his eyes asking as plainly as speech what all this fuss was about Meanwhile some of the men had already pulled a big hawser ashore and made it fast In half an hour the crew of the Amy Reade were safe on shore chilled and dripping Before they were hurried away to warmth and shelter old Paul Stockton caught Curtis s hand The tears were running freely down his hard old face Tell your uncle he is not to lay a finger on that dog he said He never killed a sheep of mine he couldn t And if he did I don t care He s welcome to kill them all if nothing but mutton ll serve his turn Curtis walked home with a glad heart mister Locksley heard old Paul s message with a smile He too had been touched by Don s splendid feat Well Curtis I m very glad that it has turned old Paul in his favour But we must shut Don up for a week or so no matter how hard he takes it You can see that for yourself After all he might have worried the sheep And anyway he must be broken of his intimacy with Ventnor s dog Curtis acknowledged the justice of this and poor Don was tied up again His captivity was not long however for Ventnor s dog was soon shot When Don was released Curtis had an anxious time for a week or two But no more sheep were worried and Don s innocence was triumphantly established As for old Paul Stockton it seemed as if he could not do enough for Curtis and Don His ancient grudge against the Locksleys was completely forgotten and from that date he was a firm friend of Curtis In regard to Don old Paul would say Why there never was such a dog before sir never He just talks with his eyes that dog does And if you d just a seen him swimming out to that schooner Bones Yes sir Every time that dog comes here he s to get the best bones we ve got for him and more n bones too That dog s a hero sir that s what he is Miss Madeline s Proposal Auntie I have something to tell you said Lina with a blush that made her look more than ever like one of the climbing roses that nodded about the windows of the old Churchill place as it was always called in Lower Wentworth Miss Madeline sitting in the low rocker by the parlour window seemed like the presiding genius of the place Everything about her matched her sweet old fashionedness from the crown of her soft brown hair dressed in the style of her long ago girlhood to the toes of her daintily slippered feet Outside of the old Churchill place in the busy streets of the up to date little town Miss Madeline might have seemed out of harmony with her surroundings But here in this dim room faintly scented with whiffs from the rose garden outside she was like a note in some sweet perfect melody of old time Lina sitting on a little stool at Miss Madeline s feet with her curly head in her aunt s lap was as pretty as Miss Madeline herself had once been She was also very happy and her happiness seemed to envelop her as in an atmosphere and lend her a new radiance and charm Miss Madeline loved her pretty niece very dearly and patted the curly head tenderly with her slender white hands What is it my dear I m I m engaged whispered Lina hiding her face in Miss Madeline s flowered muslin lap Engaged Miss Madeline s tone was one of surprise and awe She blushed as she said the word as deeply as Lina had done Then she went on with a little quiver of excitement in her voice To whom my dear Oh you don t know him Auntie but I hope you will soon His name is Ralph Wylde Isn t it pretty I met him last winter and we became very good friends But we had a quarrel before I came down here and oh I have been so unhappy over it Three weeks ago he wrote me and begged my pardon so nice of him because I was really all to blame you know And he said he loved me and all that you know No I don t know said Miss Madeline gently But but I can imagine Oh I was so happy I wrote back and I had this letter from him today He is coming down tomorrow You ll be glad to see him won t you Auntie Oh yes my dear and I am glad for your sake very glad You are sure you love him Yes indeed said Lina with a little laugh as if wondering how anyone could doubt it Presently Miss Madeline said in a shy voice Lina did did you ever receive a proposal of marriage from anybody besides mister Wylde Lina laughed roguishly Why yes Auntie ever so many A dozen at least Oh my dear cried Miss Madeline in a slightly shocked tone But I did really Sometimes it was horrid and sometimes it was funny It all depended on the man Dear me how red and uncomfortable most of them looked all but the fifth He was so cool and business like that he almost surprised me into accepting him And and what did you feel like Lina Oh frightened mostly but I always wanted to laugh too You must know how it is yourself Auntie What did you feel like when somebody proposed to you Miss Madeline flushed from chin to brow Oh Lina she faltered as if she were confessing something very disgraceful yet to which she was impelled by her strict truthfulness I I never had a proposal in my life not one Lina opened her big brown eyes in amazement Why Aunt Madeline And you so pretty What was the reason I ve often wondered said Miss Madeline faintly I was pretty as you say it s so long ago I can say that now And I had many gentlemen friends But nobody ever wanted to marry me I sometimes wish that that I could have had just one proposal Not that I wanted to marry you know I do not mean that but just so that it wouldn t have seemed that I was different from anybody else It is very foolish of me to wish it I know and even wicked for if I had not cared for the person it would have made him very unhappy But then he would have forgotten and I would have remembered It would always have been something to be a little proud of Yes said Lina absently her thoughts had gone back to Ralph That evening a letter was left at the front door of the old Churchill place It was addressed in a scholarly hand to Miss Madeline Churchill and Amelia Kent took it in Amelia had been Miss Madeline s help for years and had grown grey in her service In Amelia s loyal eyes Miss Madeline was still young and beautiful she never doubted that the letter was for her mistress Nobody else there was ever addressed as Miss Madeline Miss Madeline was sitting by the window of her own room watching the sunset through the elms and reading her evening portion of Thomas a Kempis She never liked to be disturbed when so employed but she read her letter after Amelia had gone out When she came to a certain paragraph she turned very pale and Thomas a Kempis fell to the floor unheeded When she had finished the letter she laid it on her lap clasped her hands and said Oh oh oh in a faint tremulous voice Her cheeks were very pink and her eyes very bright She did not even pick up Thomas a Kempis but went to the door and called Lina What is it Auntie asked Lina curiously noticing the signs of unusual excitement about Miss Madeline Miss Madeline held out her letter with a trembling hand Lina dear this is a letter from the reverend Cecil Thorne It it is a proposal of marriage I feel terribly upset How very strange that it should come so soon after our talk this morning I want you to read it Perhaps I ought not to show it to anyone but I would like you to see it Lina took the letter and read it through It was unmistakably a proposal of marriage and was moreover a very charming epistle of its kind albeit a little stiff and old fashioned How funny said Lina when she came to the end Funny exclaimed Miss Madeline with a trace of indignation in her gentle voice Oh I didn t mean that the letter was funny Lina hastened to explain only that as you said it is odd to think of it coming so soon after our talk But this was a little fib on Lina s part She had thought that the letter or rather the fact that it had been written to Miss Madeline funny The reverend Cecil Thorne was Miss Madeline s pastor He was a handsome scholarly man of middle age and Lina had seen a good deal of him during her summer in Lower Wentworth She had taught the infant class in Sunday School and sometimes she had thought that the minister was in love with her But she must have been mistaken she reflected it must have been her aunt after all and the reverend Cecil Thorne s shyly displayed interest in her must have been purely professional What a goose I was to be afraid he was in love with me she thought Aloud she said He says he will call tomorrow evening to receive your answer And oh what can I say to him murmured Miss Madeline in dismay She wished she had a little of Lina s experience You are going to you will accept him won t you asked Lina curiously Oh my dear no cried Miss Madeline almost vehemently I couldn t think of such a thing I am very sorry do you think he will feel badly Judging from his letter I feel sure he will said Lina decidedly Miss Madeline sighed Oh dear me It is very unpleasant But of course I must refuse him What a beautiful letter he writes too I feel very much disturbed by this Miss Madeline picked up Thomas a Kempis smoothed him out repentantly and placed the letter between his leaves When the reverend Cecil Thorne called at the old Churchill place next evening at sunset and asked for Miss Madeline Churchill Amelia showed him into the parlour and went to call her mistress mister Thorne sat down by the window that looked out on the lawn His heart gave a bound as he caught a glimpse of an airy white muslin among the trees and a ripple of distant laughter The next minute Lina appeared strolling down the secluded path that curved about the birches A young man was walking beside her with his arm around her They crossed the green square before the house and disappeared in the rose garden mister Thorne leaned back in his chair and put his hand over his eyes He felt that he had received his answer and it was a very bitter moment for him He had hardly dared hope that this bright beautiful child could care for him yet the realization came home to him none the less keenly When Miss Madeline paling and flushing by turns came shyly in he had recovered his self control sufficiently to be able to say good evening in a calm voice Miss Madeline sat down opposite to him At that moment she was devoutly thankful that she had never had any other proposal to refuse It was a dreadful ordeal If he would only help her out But he did not speak and every moment of silence made it worse I received your letter mister Thorne she faltered at last looking distressfully down at the floor My letter mister Thorne turned towards her In her agitation Miss Madeline did not notice the surprise in his face and tone Yes she said gaining a little courage since the ice was broken It it was a very great surprise to me I never thought you you cared for me as as you said And I am very sorry because because I cannot return your affection And so of course I cannot marry you mister Thorne put his hand over his eyes again He understood now that there had been some mistake and that Miss Madeline had received the letter he had written to her niece Well it did not matter the appearance of the young man in the garden had settled that Would he tell Miss Madeline of her mistake No it would only humiliate her and it made no difference since she had refused him I suppose it is of no use to ask you to reconsider your decision he said Oh no cried Miss Madeline almost aghast She was afraid he might ask it after all Not in the least use I am sorry so very sorry but I could not answer differently We I hope this will make no difference in our friendly relations mister Thorne Not at all said mister Thorne gravely We will try to forget that it has happened He bowed sadly and went out Miss Madeline watched him guiltily as he walked across the lawn He looked heart broken How dreadful it had been And Lina had refused twelve men How could she have lived through it Perhaps one gets accustomed to doing it reflected Miss Madeline But I am sure I never could Did mister Thorne feel very badly whispered Lina that night I m afraid he did confessed Miss Madeline sorrowfully He looked so pale and sad Lina that my heart ached for him I am very thankful that I have never had any other proposals to decline It is a very unpleasant experience But she added with a little tinge of satisfaction in her sweet voice I am glad I had one It it has made me feel more like other people you know dear Miss Sally s Company How beautiful said Mary Seymour delightedly as they dismounted from their wheels on the crest of the hill Ida who could have supposed that such a view would be our reward for climbing that long tedious hill with its ruts and stones Don t you feel repaid Yes but I am dreadfully thirsty said Ida who was always practical and never as enthusiastic over anything as Mary was Yet she too felt a keen pleasure in the beauty of the scene before them Almost at their feet lay the sea creaming and shimmering in the mellow sunshine Beyond on either hand stretched rugged brown cliffs and rocks here running out to sea in misty purple headlands there curving into bays and coves that seemed filled up with sunlight and glamour and pearly hazes a beautiful shore and seemingly a lonely one The only house visible from where the girls stood was a tiny grey one with odd low eaves and big chimneys that stood down in the little valley on their right where the cliffs broke away to let a brook run out to sea and formed a small cove on whose sandy shore the waves lapped and crooned within a stone s throw of the house On either side of the cove a headland made out to sea curving around to enclose the sparkling water as in a cup What a picturesque spot said Mary But what a lonely one protested Ida Why there isn t another house in sight I wonder who lives in it Anyway I m going down to ask them for a drink of water I d like to ask for a square meal too said Mary laughing I am discovering that I am hungry Fine scenery is very satisfying to the soul to be sure but it doesn t still the cravings of the inner girl And we ve wheeled ten miles this afternoon I m getting hungrier every minute They reached the little grey house by way of a sloping grassy lane Everything about it was very neat and trim In front a white washed paling shut in the garden which sheltered as it was by the house was ablaze with poppies and hollyhocks and geraniums A path bordered by big white clam shells led through it to the front door whose steps were slabs of smooth red sandstone from the beach No children here certainly whispered Ida Every one of those clam shells is placed just so And this walk is swept every day No we shall never dare to ask for anything to eat here They would be afraid of our scattering crumbs Ida lifted her hand to knock but before she could do so the door was thrown open and a breathless little lady appeared on the threshold She was very small with an eager delicately featured face and dark eyes twinkling behind gold rimmed glasses She was dressed immaculately in an old fashioned gown of grey silk with a white muslin fichu crossed over her shoulders and her silvery hair fell on each side of her face in long smooth curls that just touched her shoulders and bobbed and fluttered with her every motion behind it was caught up in a knot on her head and surmounted by a tiny lace cap She looks as if she had just stepped out of a bandbox of last century thought Mary Are you Cousin Abner s girls demanded the little lady eagerly There was such excitement and expectation in her face and voice that both the Seymour girls felt uncomfortably that they ought to be Cousin Abner s girls No said Mary reluctantly we re not We are only Martin Seymour s girls All the light went out of the little lady s face as if some illuminating lamp had suddenly been quenched behind it She seemed fairly to droop under her disappointment As for the rest the name of Martin Seymour evidently conveyed no especial meaning to her ears How could she know that he was a multi millionaire who was popularly supposed to breakfast on railroads and lunch on small corporations and that his daughters were girls whom all people delighted to honour No of course you are not Cousin Abner s girls she said sorrowfully I d have known you couldn t be if I had just stopped to think Because you are dark and they would be fair of course Cousin Abner and his wife were both fair But when I saw you coming down the lane I was peeking through the hall window upstairs you know I and Juliana I was sure you were Helen and Beatrice at last And I can t help wishing you were I wish we were too since you expected them said Mary smiling But Oh I wasn t really expecting them broke in the little lady Only I am always hoping that they will come They never have yet but Trenton isn t so very far away and it is so lonely here I just long for company I and Juliana and I thought I was going to have it today Cousin Abner came to see me once since I moved here and he said the girls would come too but that was six months ago and they haven t come yet But perhaps they will soon It is always something to look forward to you know She talked in a sweet chirpy voice like a bird s There were pathetic notes in it too as the girls instinctively felt How very quaint and sweet and unworldly she was Mary found herself feeling indignant at Cousin Abner s girls whoever they were for their neglect We are out for a spin on our wheels said Ida and we are very thirsty We thought perhaps you would be kind enough to give us a drink of water Oh my dear anything anything I have is at your service said the little lady delightedly If you will come in I will get you some lemonade I am afraid it is too much trouble began Mary Oh no no cried the little lady It is a pleasure I love doing things for people I wish more of them would come to give me the chance I never have any company and I do so long for it It s very lonesome here at Golden Gate Oh if you would only stay to tea with me it would make me so happy I am all prepared I prepare every Saturday morning in particular so that if Cousin Abner s girls did come I would be all ready And when nobody comes Juliana and I have to eat everything up ourselves And that is bad for us it gives Juliana indigestion If you would only stay We will agreed Ida promptly And we re glad of the chance We are both terribly hungry and it is very good of you to ask us Oh indeed it isn t It s just selfishness in me that s what it is pure selfishness I want company so much Come in my dears and I suppose I must introduce myself because you don t know me do you now I m Miss Sally Temple and this is Golden Gate Cottage Dear me this is something like living You are special providences that you are indeed She whisked them through a quaint little parlour where everything was as dainty and neat and old fashioned as herself and into a spare bedroom beyond it to put off their hats Now just excuse me a minute while I run out and tell Juliana that we are going to have company to tea She will be so glad Juliana will Make yourselves at home my dears Isn t she delicious said Mary when Miss Sally had tripped out I d like to shake Cousin Abner s girls This is what Dot Halliday would call an adventure Ida Isn t it Miss Sally and this quaint old spot both seem like a chapter out of the novels our grandmothers cried over Look here Mary she is lonely and our visit seems like a treat to her Let us try to make it one Let s just chum with her and tell her all about ourselves and our amusements and our dresses That sounds frivolous but you know what I mean She ll like it Let s be company in real earnest for her When Miss Sally came back she was attended by Juliana carrying a tray of lemonade glasses Juliana proved to be a diminutive lass of about fourteen whose cheerful freckled face wore an expansive grin of pleasure Evidently Juliana was as fond of company as her mistress was Afterwards the girls overheard a subdued colloquy between Miss Sally and Juliana out in the hall Go set the table Juliana and put on Grandmother Temple s wedding china be sure you dust it carefully and the best tablecloth and be sure you get the crease straight and put some sweet peas in the centre and be sure they are fresh I want everything extra nice Juliana Yes m Miss Sally I ll see to it Isn t it great to have company Miss Sally whispered Juliana The Seymour girls long remembered that tea table and the delicacies with which it was heaped Privately they did not wonder that Juliana had indigestion when she had to eat many such unaided Being hungry they did full justice to Miss Sally s good things much to that little lady s delight She told them all about herself She had lived at Golden Gate Cottage only a year Before that I lived away down the country at Millbridge with a cousin My Uncle Ephraim owned Golden Gate Cottage and when he died he left it to me and I came here to live It is a pretty place isn t it You see those two headlands out there In the morning when the sun rises the water between them is just a sea of gold and that is why Uncle Ephraim had a fancy to call his place Golden Gate I love it here It is so nice to have a home of my own I would be quite content if I had more company But I have you today and perhaps Beatrice and Helen will come next week So I ve really a great deal to be thankful for What is your Cousin Abner s other name asked Mary with a vague recollection of hearing of Beatrice and Helen somebody in Trenton Reed Abner Abimelech Reed answered Miss Sally promptly A A Reed he signs himself now He is very well to do I am told and he carries on business in town He was a very fine young man my Cousin Abner I don t know his wife Mary and Ida exchanged glances Beatrice and Helen Reed They knew them slightly as the daughters of a new rich family who were hangers on of the fashionable society in Trenton They were regarded as decidedly vulgar and so far their efforts to gain an entry into the exclusive circle where the Seymours and their like revolved had not been very successful I m afraid Miss Sally will wait a long while before she sees Cousin Abner s girls said Mary when they had gone back to the parlour and Miss Sally had excused herself to superintend the washing of Grandmother Temple s wedding china They probably look on her as a poor relation to be ignored altogether whereas if they were only like her Trenton society would have made a place for them long ago The Seymour girls enjoyed that visit as much as Miss Sally did She was eager to hear all about their girlish lives and amusements They told her of their travels of famous men and women they had seen of parties they had attended the dresses they wore the little fads and hobbies of their set all jumbled up together and all listened to eagerly by Miss Sally and also by Juliana who was permitted to sit on the stairs out in the hall and so gather in the crumbs of this intellectual feast Oh you ve been such pleasant company said Miss Sally when the girls went away Mary took the little lady s hands in hers and looked affectionately down into her face Would you like it you and Juliana if we came out to see you often And perhaps brought some of our friends with us Oh if you only would breathed Miss Sally Mary laughed and obeying a sudden impulse bent and kissed Miss Sally s cheek We ll come then she promised Please look upon us as your steady company henceforth The girls kept their word Thereafter nearly every Saturday of the summer found them taking tea with Miss Sally at Golden Gate Sometimes they came alone sometimes they brought other girls It soon became a decided fad in their set to go to see Miss Sally Everybody who met her loved her at sight It was considered a special treat to be taken by the Seymours to Golden Gate As for Miss Sally her cup of happiness was almost full She had company to her heart s content and of the very kind she loved bright merry fun loving girls who devoured her dainties with a frank zest that delighted her filled the quaint old rooms with laughter and life and chattered to her of all their plans and frolics and hopes There was just one little cloud on Miss Sally s fair sky If only Cousin Abner s girls would come she once said wistfully to Mary Nobody can quite take the place of one s own you know My heart yearns after them Mary was very silent and thoughtful as she drove back to Trenton that night Two days afterwards she went to missus Gardiner s lawn party The Reed girls were there They were tall fair handsome girls somewhat too lavishly and pronouncedly dressed in expensive gowns and hats and looking as they felt very much on the outside of things They brightened and bridled however when missus Gardiner brought Mary Seymour up and introduced her If there was one thing on earth that the Reed girls longed for more than another it was to get in with the Seymour girls After Mary had chatted with them for a few minutes in a friendly way she said I think we have a mutual friend in Miss Sally Temple of Golden Gate haven t we I m sure I ve heard her speak of you The Reed girls flushed They did not care to have the rich Seymour girls know of their connection with that queer old cousin of their father s who lived in that out of the world spot up country She is a distant cousin of ours said Beatrice carelessly but we ve never met her Oh how much you have missed said Mary frankly She is the sweetest and most charming little lady I have ever met and I am proud to number her among my friends Golden Gate is such an idyllic little spot too We go there so often that I fear Miss Sally will think we mean to outwear our welcome We hope to have her visit us in town this winter Well good by for now I ll tell Miss Sally I ve met you She will be pleased to hear about you When Mary had gone the Reed girls looked at each other I suppose we ought to have gone to see Cousin Sally before said Beatrice Father said we ought to How on earth did the Seymours pick her up said Helen Of course we must go and see her Go they did The very next day Miss Sally s cup of happiness brimmed right over for Cousin Abner s girls came to Golden Gate at last They were very nice to her too Indeed in spite of a good deal of snobbishness and false views of life they were good hearted girls under it all and some plain common sense they had inherited from their father came to the surface and taught them to see that Miss Sally was a relative of whom anyone might be proud They succumbed to her charm as the others had done and thoroughly enjoyed their visit to Golden Gate They went away promising to come often again and I may say right here that they kept their promise and a real friendship grew up between Miss Sally and Cousin Abner s girls that was destined to work wonders for the latter not only socially and mentally but spiritually as well for it taught them that sincerity and honest kindliness of heart and manner are the best passports everywhere and that pretence of any kind is a vulgarity not to be tolerated This took time of course The Reed girls could not discard their snobbishness all at once But in the end it was pretty well taken out of them Miss Sally never dreamed of this or the need for it She loved Cousin Abner s girls from the first and always admired them exceedingly And then it is so good to have your own folks coming as company she told the Seymour girls Oh I m just in the seventh heaven of happiness But dearies I think you will always be my favourites mine and Juliana s I ve plenty of company now and it s all thanks to you Oh no said Mary quickly Miss Sally your company comes to you for just your own sake You ve made Golden Gate a veritable Mecca for us all You don t know and you never will know how much good you have done us You are so good and true and sweet that we girls all feel as if we were bound to live up to you don t you see And we all love you Miss Sally I m so glad breathed Miss Sally with shining eyes and so is Juliana missus March s Revenge I declare it is a real fall day said missus Stapp dropping into a chair with a sigh of relief as missus March ushered her into the cosy little sitting room 
5321-53046-0000	train-other-500	The wind would chill the marrow in your bones winter ll be here before you know it That s so assented missus March
none	none	 bustling about to stir up the fire But I don t know as I mind it at all 
5321-53046-0001	train-other-500	Winter is real pleasant when it does come but I must say I don t fancy these betwixt and between days much
none	none	 Sit up to the fire Theodosia 
5321-53046-0002	train-other-500	You look real blue I feel so too Lawful heart but this is comfort This chimney corner of yours Anna is the cosiest spot in the world When did you get home from Maitland asked missus March
5321-53046-0061	train-other-500	Lawful heart
none	none	 but this is comfort This chimney corner of yours Anna is the cosiest spot in the world When did you get home from Maitland asked missus March Did you have a pleasant time 
5321-53046-0003	train-other-500	And how did you leave Emily and the children missus Stapp took this trio of interrogations in calm detail I came home Saturday she said as she unrolled her knitting Nice wet day it was too
none	none	 And as for my visit 
5321-53046-0004	train-other-500	yes I enjoyed myself pretty well
none	none	 not but what I worried over Peter s rheumatism a good deal Emily is well and the children ought to be for 
5321-53046-0005	train-other-500	such rampageous young ones I never saw
none	none	 Emily can t do no more with them than an old hen with a brood of ducks 
5321-53046-0006	train-other-500	But lawful heart Anna don t mind about my little affairs
none	none	 The news Peter had for me about you when I got home fairly took my breath He came down to the garden gate to shout it before I was out of the wagon 
5321-53046-0007	train-other-500	I couldn t believe but what he was joking at first You should have seen Peter
none	none	 He had an old red shawl tied round his rheumatic shoulder and he was waving his arms like a crazy man 
5321-53046-0008	train-other-500	I declare I thought the chimney was afire Theodosia Theodosia he shouted Anna March has had a fortune left her by her brother in Australy
none	none	 and she s bought the old Carroll place and is going to move up there That was his salute when I got home I d have been over before this to hear all about it but things were at such sixes and sevens in the house that I couldn t go visiting until I d straightened them out a bit 
5321-53046-0009	train-other-500	Peter s real neat as men go but lawful heart such a mess as he makes of housekeeping I didn t know you had a brother living No more did I Theodosia I thought as
none	none	 everyone else did that poor Charles was at the bottom of the sea forty years ago It s that long since he ran away from home He had a quarrel with Father and he was always dreadful high spirited He went to sea and we heard that he had sailed for England in the Helen Ray She was never heard of after and we all supposed that my poor brother had perished with her 
5321-53046-0010	train-other-500	And four weeks ago I got a letter from a firm of lawyers in Melbourne Australia saying that my brother Charles Bennett had died and left all his fortune to me I couldn t believe it at first but they sent me some things of his that he had when he left home
none	none	 and there was an old picture of myself among them with my name written on it in my own hand so then I knew there was no mistake 
5321-53046-0011	train-other-500	But whether Charles did sail in the Helen Ray or
none	none	 if he did how he escaped from her and got to Australia 
5321-53046-0012	train-other-500	I don t know and it isn t likely I ever will Well
none	none	 of all wonderful things commented missus Stapp I was glad to hear that I was heir to so much money said missus March firmly 
5321-53046-0013	train-other-500	At first I felt as if it were awful of me to be glad when it came to me by my brother s death But I mourned for poor Charles forty years ago and I can t sense that he has only just died Not but what I d rather have seen him come home alive than
5321-53046-0014	train-other-500	have all the money in the world but it has come about otherwise and as the money is lawfully mine I may as well feel pleased about it And you ve bought the Carroll place said missus Stapp with the freedom of a privileged friend
5321-53046-0015	train-other-500	Whatever made you do it I m sure you are as cosy here as need be and nobody but yourself Isn t this house big enough for you No it isn t All my life I ve been hankering for a good big roomy house and all my life
none	none	 I ve had to put up with 
5321-53046-0016	train-other-500	little boxes of places not big enough to turn round in I ve been contented and
none	none	 made the best of what I had 
5321-53046-0017	train-other-500	but now that I can afford it I mean to have a house that will suit me The Carroll house is just what I want for all it is a little old fashioned I ve always had a notion of that house although I never expected to own it any more than the moon
5321-53046-0018	train-other-500	It s a real handsome place
none	none	 admitted missus Stapp 
5321-53046-0019	train-other-500	but I expect it will need a lot of fixing up
none	none	 Nobody has lived in it for six years When are you going to move in 
5321-53046-0020	train-other-500	In about three weeks if all goes well I m having it all painted and done over inside The outside can wait until the spring It s queer how things come about
none	none	 said missus Stapp meditatively I guess old missus Carroll never imagined her home was going to pass into other folks hands as it has When you and I were girls and Louise Carroll was giving herself such airs over us you didn t much expect to ever stand in her shoes did you Do you remember Lou Yes I do said missus March sharply A change came over her sonsy smiling face It actually looked hard and revengeful 
5321-53046-0021	train-other-500	and a cruel light flickered in her dark brown eyes I ll not forget Lou Carroll as long as I live She is the only person in this world I ever hated I suppose it is sinful to say it but I hate her still and always will
5321-53046-0022	train-other-500	I never liked her myself admitted missus Stapp She thought herself above us all Well for that matter I suppose she was but she needn t have rubbed it in so Well she might have been above me
none	none	 said missus March bitterly 
5321-53046-0023	train-other-500	but she wasn t above twitting and snubbing me every chance she got
none	none	 She always had a spite at me from the time we were children together at school When we grew up it was worse I couldn t begin to tell you all the times that girl insulted me But there was once in particular 
5321-53046-0024	train-other-500	I ll never forgive her for it I was at a party and she was there too
none	none	 and so was that young Trenham Manning who was visiting the Ashleys Do you remember him Dosia 
5321-53046-0025	train-other-500	He was a handsome young fellow and Lou had a liking for him so all the girls said But he never looked at her that night and he kept by me the whole time It made Lou furious and at last
none	none	 she came up to me with a sneer on her face and her black eyes just snapping 
5321-53046-0026	train-other-500	and said Miss Bennett Mother told me to tell you
none	none	 to tell your ma that if that plain sewing isn t done by tomorrow night she ll send for it and give it to somebody else if people engage to have work done by a certain time and don t keep their word 
5321-53046-0027	train-other-500	they needn t expect to get it Oh how badly I felt Mother and I were
none	none	 poor and had to work hard 
5321-53046-0028	train-other-500	but we had feelings just like other people and to be insulted like that before Trenham Manning I just burst out crying then and there
none	none	 and ran away and hid It was very silly of me but 
5321-53046-0029	train-other-500	I couldn t help it That stings me yet If I was ever to get a chance to pay Lou Carroll out for that I d take it without any compunction
none	none	 Oh but that is unchristian 
5321-53046-0030	train-other-500	protested missus Stapp feebly Perhaps so but it s the way I feel
none	none	 Old Parson Jones used to say that people were marbled good and bad pretty even but that in everybody there were one or two streaks just pure wicked 
5321-53046-0031	train-other-500	I guess Lou Carroll is my wicked streak I haven t seen or heard of her for years ever since she married that worthless Dency Baxter and went away She may be dead for all I know I don t expect ever to have a chance to pay her out
5321-53046-0032	train-other-500	But mark what I say Theodosia if I ever have I will missus March snipped off her thread as if she challenged the world missus Stapp felt uncomfortable over the unusual display of feeling she had evoked
none	none	 and hastened to change the subject 
5321-53046-0033	train-other-500	In three weeks time
none	none	 missus March was established in her new home 
5321-53046-0034	train-other-500	and the old Carroll house blossomed out into renewed splendour Theodosia Stapp
none	none	 who had dropped in to see it 
5321-53046-0035	train-other-500	was in a rapture of admiration You have a lovely home now Anna I used to think it fine enough in the Carrolls time but it wasn t as grand as this And that reminds me I have something to tell you but
none	none	 I don t want you to get as excited as you did the last time I mentioned her name 
5321-53046-0036	train-other-500	You remember the last day I was to see you we were talking of Lou Carroll Well
none	none	 next day I was downtown in a store 
5321-53046-0037	train-other-500	and who should sail in but missus Joel Kent from Oriental You know missus Joel Sarah Chapple that was She and her man keep a little hotel up at Oriental They re not very well off She is a cousin of old missus Carroll but
none	none	 lawful heart the Carrolls didn t used to make much of the relationship 
5321-53046-0038	train-other-500	Well missus Joel and I had a chat She told me all her troubles she always has lots of them Sarah was always of a grumbling turn and she had a brand new stock of them this time
none	none	 What do you think Anna March 
5321-53046-0039	train-other-500	Lou Carroll or missus Baxter I suppose I should say is up there at Joel Kent s at Oriental dying of consumption leastwise missus Joel says she is Lou Carroll dying at Oriental
5321-53046-0040	train-other-500	cried missus March Yes She came there from goodness knows where about a month ago
none	none	 might as well have dropped from the clouds missus Joel says 
5321-53046-0041	train-other-500	for all she expected of it Her husband is dead and I guess he led her a life of it when he was alive
none	none	 and she s as poor as second skimmings She was aiming to come here missus Joel says but when she got to Oriental she wasn t fit to stir a step further and the Kents had to keep her 
5321-53046-0042	train-other-500	I gather from what missus Joel said
none	none	 that she s rather touched in her mind too 
5321-53046-0043	train-other-500	and has an awful hankering to get home here to this very house
none	none	 She appears to have the idea that it is hers 
5321-53046-0044	train-other-500	and all just the same as it used to be I guess she is a sight of trouble and missus Joel ain t the woman to like that But there She has to work most awful hard
none	none	 and I suppose a sick person doesn t come handy in a hotel 
5321-53046-0045	train-other-500	I guess you ve got your revenge Anna without lifting a finger to get it Think of Lou Carroll coming to that The next day was cold and raw The ragged bare trees in the old Carroll grounds shook
none	none	 and writhed in the gusts of wind 
5321-53046-0046	train-other-500	Now and then a drifting scud of rain dashed across the windows missus March looked out with a shiver and turned thankfully
none	none	 to her own cosy fireside again Presently she thought she heard a low knock at the front door 
5321-53046-0047	train-other-500	and went to see As she opened it a savage swirl of damp wind rushed in and
none	none	 the shrinking figure leaning against one of the fluted columns of the Grecian porch 
5321-53046-0048	train-other-500	seemed to cower before its fury
none	none	 It was a woman who stood there a woman 
5321-53046-0049	train-other-500	whose emaciated face wore a piteous expression as she lifted it to missus March
none	none	 You don t know me of course 
5321-53046-0050	train-other-500	she said with a feeble attempt at dignity I am missus Baxter I
none	none	 I used to live here long ago 
5321-53046-0051	train-other-500	I thought I d walk over today and see my old home A fit of coughing interrupted her words and she trembled like a leaf Gracious me exclaimed missus March blankly
none	none	 You don t mean to tell me that you have walked over from Oriental today and you a sick woman For pity s sake come in quick 
5321-53046-0052	train-other-500	And if you re not wet to the skin
none	none	 She fairly pulled her visitor into the hall and led her to the sitting room Sit down Take this big easy chair right up to the fire so 
5321-53046-0053	train-other-500	Let me take your bonnet and shawl I must run right out to tell Hannah to get you a hot drink You are very kind whispered the other I don t know you but
none	none	 you look like a woman I used to know when I was a girl 
5321-53046-0054	train-other-500	She was a missus Bennett and she had a daughter Anna Do you know what became of her I forget I forget everything now My name is March
5321-53046-0055	train-other-500	said missus March briefly ignoring the question I don t suppose you ever heard it before She wrapped her own warm shawl about the other woman s thin shoulders Then she hastened to the kitchen and soon returned carrying a tray of food and a steaming hot drink
5321-53046-0056	train-other-500	She wheeled a small table up to her visitor s side and said very kindly Now take a bite my dear
none	none	 and this raspberry vinegar will warm you right up 
5321-53046-0057	train-other-500	It is a dreadful day for you to be out Why on earth didn t Joel Kent drive you over They didn t know I was coming whispered missus Baxter anxiously I I ran away
none	none	 Sarah wouldn t have let me come if she had known 
5321-53046-0058	train-other-500	But I wanted to come so much It is so nice to be home again
none	none	 missus March watched her guest as she ate and drank It was plain enough that her mind or rather her memory was affected She did not realize that this was no longer her home 
5321-53046-0059	train-other-500	At moments she seemed to fancy herself back in the past again Once or twice she called missus March Mother Presently a sharp knock was heard at the hall door
none	none	 missus March excused herself and went out 
5321-53046-0060	train-other-500	In the porch stood Theodosia Stapp and a woman whom missus March did not at first glance recognize a tall aggressive looking person whose sharp black eyes darted in past missus March
none	none	 and searched every corner of the hall before anyone had time to speak Lawful heart puffed missus Stapp as she stepped in out of the biting wind I m right out of breath missus March allow me to introduce missus Kent 
5321-53046-0062	train-other-500	We re looking for missus Baxter She has run away and we thought perhaps she came here Did she
none	none	 She is in my sitting room now 
5321-53046-0063	train-other-500	said missus March quietly Didn t I say so demanded missus Kent turning to missus Stapp
none	none	 She spoke in a sharp high pitched tone that grated on missus March s nerves Doesn t she beat all 
5321-53046-0064	train-other-500	She slipped away this morning when I was busy in the kitchen
none	none	 And to think of her walking six miles over here in this wind 
5321-53046-0065	train-other-500	I dunno how she did it I don t believe she s half as sick as she pretends Well I ve got my wagon out here missus March and I ll be much obliged if you ll tell her I m here to take her home
none	none	 I s pose we ll have a fearful scene 
5321-53046-0066	train-other-500	I don t see that there is any call for a scene said missus March firmly The poor woman has just got here and she thinks she has got home She might as well think so if it is of any comfort to her You d better leave her here
5321-53046-0067	train-other-500	Theodosia gave a stifled gasp of amazement but missus March went serenely on
none	none	 I ll take care of the poor soul as long as she needs it and that will not be very long in my opinion for 
5321-53046-0068	train-other-500	if ever I saw death in a woman s face it
none	none	 is looking out of hers I ve plenty of time to look after her and make her comfortable missus Joel Kent was voluble in her thanks It was evident that she was delighted to get the sick woman off her hands missus March cut her short with an invitation to stay to tea 
5321-53046-0069	train-other-500	but missus Kent declined I ve got to hurry home straight off and get the men s suppers Such a scamper to have over that woman I m sure I m thankful you re willing to let her stay for she d never be contented anywhere else
none	none	 I ll send over what few things she has tomorrow When missus Kent had gone missus March and missus Stapp looked at each other 
5321-53046-0070	train-other-500	And so this is your revenge Anna March said the latter solemnly Do you remember what you said to me about her Yes I do Theodosia and I thought I meant every word of it But I guess my wicked streak
5321-53046-0071	train-other-500	ran out just when I needed it to depend on Besides you see I ve thought of Lou Carroll all these years as she was when I knew her handsome and saucy and proud But that poor creature in there isn t any more like the Lou Carroll I knew than you are not a mite
none	none	 The old Lou Carroll is dead already and my spite is dead with her Will you come in and see her 
5321-53046-0072	train-other-500	Well no not just now She wouldn t know me and
none	none	 missus Joel says strangers kind of excite her a pretty bad place the hotel would be for her at that rate I should think 
5321-53046-0073	train-other-500	I must go and tell Peter about it and I ll send up
none	none	 some of my black currant jam for her When missus Stapp had gone missus March went back to her guest Lou Baxter had fallen asleep with her head pillowed on the soft plush back of her chair 
5321-53046-0074	train-other-500	missus March looked at the hollow hectic cheeks and the changed
none	none	 wasted features and her bright brown eyes softened with tears 
5321-53046-0075	train-other-500	Poor Lou
none	none	 she said softly as she brushed a loose lock of grey hair back from the sleeping woman s brow Nan Nan was polishing the tumblers at the pantry window outside of which John Osborne was leaning among the vines His arms were folded on the sill and his straw hat was pushed back from his flushed eager face as he watched Nan s deft movements Beyond them old Abe Stewart was mowing the grass in the orchard with a scythe and casting uneasy glances at the pair Old Abe did not approve of John Osborne as a suitor for Nan John was poor and old Abe although he was the wealthiest farmer in Granville was bent on Nan s making a good match He looked upon John Osborne as a mere fortune hunter and it was a thorn in the flesh to see him talking to Nan while he old Abe was too far away to hear what they were saying He had a good deal of confidence in Nan she was a sensible level headed girl Still there was no knowing what freak even a sensible girl might take into her head and Nan was so determined when she did make up her mind She was his own daughter in that However old Abe need not have worried himself It could not be said that Nan was helping John Osborne on in his wooing at all Instead she was teasing and snubbing him by turns Nan was very pretty Moreover Nan was well aware of the fact She knew that the way her dark hair curled around her ears and forehead was bewitching that her complexion was the envy of every girl in Granville that her long lashes had a trick of drooping over very soft dark eyes in a fashion calculated to turn masculine heads hopelessly John Osborne knew all this too to his cost He had called to ask Nan to go with him to the Lone Lake picnic the next day At this request Nan dropped her eyes and murmured that she was sorry but he was too late she had promised to go with somebody else There was no need of Nan s making such a mystery about it The somebody else was her only cousin Ned Bennett who had had a quarrel with his own girl the latter lived at Lone Lake and Ned had coaxed Nan to go over with him and try her hand at patching matters up between him and his offended lady love And Nan who was an amiable creature and tender hearted where anybody s lover except her own was concerned had agreed to go But John Osborne at once jumped to the conclusion as Nan had very possibly meant him to do that the mysterious somebody was Bryan Lee and the thought was gall and wormwood to him Whom are you going with he asked That would be telling Nan said with maddening indifference Is it Bryan Lee demanded John It might be said Nan reflectively and then again you know it mightn t John was silent he was no match for Nan when it came to a war of words He scowled moodily at the shining tumblers Nan I m going out west he said finally Nan stared at him with her last tumbler poised in mid air very much as if he had announced his intention of going to the North Pole or Equatorial Africa John Osborne are you crazy Not quite And I m in earnest I can tell you that Nan set the glass down with a decided thud John s curtness displeased her He needn t suppose that it made any difference to her if he took it into his stupid head to go to Afghanistan Oh she remarked carelessly Well I suppose if you ve got the Western fever your case is hopeless Would it be impertinent to inquire why you are going There s nothing else for me to do Nan said John Bryan Lee is going to foreclose the mortgage next month and I ll have to clear out He says he can t wait any longer I ve worked hard enough and done my best to keep the old place but it s been uphill work and I m beaten at last Nan sat blankly down on the stool by the window Her face was a study which John Osborne watching old Abe s movements missed Well I never she gasped John Osborne do you mean to tell me that Bryan Lee is going to do that How did he come to get your mortgage Bought it from old Townsend answered John briefly Oh he s within his rights I ll admit I ve even got behind with the interest this past year I ll go out west and begin over again It s a burning shame said Nan violently John looked around in time to see two very red spots on her cheeks You don t care though Nan I don t like to see anyone unjustly treated declared Nan and that is what you ve been You ve never had half a chance And after the way you ve slaved too If Lee would wait a little I might do something yet now that Aunt Alice is gone said John bitterly I m not afraid of work But he won t he means to take his spite out at last Nan hesitated Surely Bryan isn t so mean as that she stammered Perhaps he ll change his mind if if Osborne wheeled about with face aflame Don t you say a word to him about it Nan he cried Don t you go interceding with him for me I ve got some pride left He can take the farm from me and he can take you maybe but he can t take my self respect I won t beg him for mercy Don t you dare to say a word to him about it Nan s eyes flashed She was offended to find her sympathy flung back in her face Don t be alarmed she said tartly I shan t bother myself about your concerns I ve no doubt you re able to look out for them yourself Osborne turned away As he did so he saw Bryan Lee driving up the lane Perhaps Nan saw it too At any rate she leaned out of the window John John Osborne half turned You ll be up again soon won t you His face hardened I ll come to say goodbye before I go of course he answered shortly He came face to face with Lee at the gate where the latter was tying his sleek chestnut to a poplar He acknowledged his rival s condescending nod with a scowl Lee looked after him with a satisfied smile Poor beggar he muttered He feels pretty cheap I reckon I ve spoiled his chances in this quarter Old Abe doesn t want any poverty stricken hangers on about his place and Nan won t dream of taking him when she knows he hasn t a roof over his head He stopped for a chat with old Abe Old Abe approved of Bryan Lee He was a son in law after old Abe s heart Meanwhile Nan had seated herself at the pantry window and was ostentatiously hemming towels in apparent oblivion of suitor No two Nevertheless when Bryan came up she greeted him with an unusually sweet smile and at once plunged into an animated conversation Bryan had not come to ask her to go to the picnic business prevented him from going But he meant to find out if she were going with John Osborne As Nan was serenely impervious to all hints he was finally forced to ask her bluntly if she was going to the picnic Well yes she expected to Oh Might he ask with whom Nan didn t know that it was a question of public interest at all It isn t with that Osborne fellow is it demanded Bryan incautiously Nan tossed her head Well why not she asked Look here Nan said Lee angrily if you re going to the picnic with John Osborne I m surprised at you What do you mean by encouraging him so He s as poor as Job s turkey I suppose you ve heard that I ve been compelled to foreclose the mortgage on his farm Nan kept her temper sweetly a dangerous sign had Bryan but known it Yes he was telling me so this morning she answered slowly Oh was he I suppose he gave me my character No he didn t say very much about it at all He said of course you were within your rights But do you really mean to do it Bryan Of course I do said Bryan promptly I can t wait any longer for my money and I d never get it if I did Osborne can t even pay the interest It isn t because he hasn t worked hard enough then said Nan He has just slaved on that place ever since he grew up Well yes he has worked hard in a way But he s kind of shiftless for all that no manager as you might say Some folks would have been clear by now but Osborne is one of those men that are bound to get behind He hasn t got any business faculty He isn t shiftless said Nan quickly and it isn t his fault if he has got behind It s all because of his care for his aunt He has had to spend more on her doctor s bills than would have raised the mortgage And now that she is dead and he might have a chance to pull up you go and foreclose A man must look out for Number One said Bryan easily admiring Nan s downcast eyes and rosy cheeks I haven t any spite against Osborne but business is business you know Nan opened her lips to say something but remembering Osborne s parting injunction she shut them again She shot a scornful glance at Lee as he stood with his arms folded on the sill beside her Bryan lingered talking small talk until Nan announced that she must see about getting tea And you won t tell me who is going to take you to the picnic he coaxed Oh it s Ned Bennett said Nan indifferently Bryan felt relieved He unpinned the huge cluster of violets on his coat and laid them down on the sill beside her before he went Nan flicked them off with her fingers as she watched him cross the lawn his own self satisfied smile upon his face A week later the Osborne homestead had passed into Bryan Lee s hands and John Osborne was staying with his cousin at Thornhope pending his departure for the west He had never been to see Nan since that last afternoon but Bryan Lee haunted the Stewart place One day he suddenly stopped coming and although Nan was discreetly silent in due time it came to old Abe s ears by various driblets of gossip that Nan had refused him Old Abe marched straightway home to Nan in a fury and demanded if this were true Nan curtly admitted that it was Old Abe was so much taken aback by her coolness that he asked almost meekly what was her reason for doing such a fool trick Because he turned John Osborne out of house and home returned Nan composedly If he hadn t done that there is no telling what might have happened I might even have married him because I liked him very well and it would have pleased you At any rate I wouldn t have married John when you were against him Now I mean to Old Abe stormed furiously at this but Nan kept so provokingly cool that he was conscious of wasting breath He went off in a rage but Nan did not feel particularly anxious now that the announcement was over He would cool down she knew John Osborne worried her more She didn t see clearly how she was to marry him unless he asked her and he had studiously avoided her since the foreclosure But Nan did not mean to be baffled or to let her lover slip through her fingers for want of a little courage She was not old Abe Stewart s daughter for nothing One day Ned Bennett dropped in and said that John Osborne would start for the west in three days That evening Nan went up to her room and dressed herself in the prettiest dress she owned combed her hair around her sparkling face in bewitching curls pinned a cluster of apple blossoms at her belt and thus equipped marched down in the golden sunset light to the Mill Creek Bridge John Osborne on his return from Thornhope half an hour later found her there leaning over the rail among the willows Nan started in well assumed surprise and then asked him why he had not been to see her John blushed stammered didn t know had been busy Nan cut short his halting excuses by demanding to know if he were really going away and what he intended to do I ll go out on the prairies and take up a claim said Osborne sturdily Begin life over again free of debt It ll be hard work but I m not afraid of that I will succeed if it takes me years They walked on in silence Nan came to the conclusion that Osborne meant to hold his peace John she said tremulously won t won t you find it very lonely out there Of course I expect that I shall have to get used to it Nan grew nervous Proposing to a man was really very dreadful Wouldn t it be nicer for you she faltered that is it wouldn t be so lonely for you would it if if you had me out there with you John Osborne stopped squarely in the dusty road and looked at her Nan he exclaimed Oh if you can t take a hint said Nan in despair It was all of an hour later that a man drove past them as they loitered up the hill road in the twilight It was Bryan Lee he had taken from Osborne his house and land but he had not been able to take Nan Stewart after all 
5910-53048-0000	train-other-500	Natty of Blue Point Natty Miller strolled down to the wharf where Bliss Ford was tying up the Cockawee Bliss was scowling darkly at the boat a trim new one painted white
5910-53048-0001	train-other-500	whose furled sails seemed unaccountably wet and whose glistening interior likewise dripped with moisture
none	none	 A group of fishermen on the wharf were shaking their heads sagely as Natty drew near Might as well split her up for kindlings Bliss said Jake McLaren You ll never get men to sail in her It passed the first time seeing as only young Johnson was skipper 
5910-53048-0003	train-other-500	but when a boat turns turtle with Captain Frank in command there s something serious wrong with her What s up asked Natty The Cockawee upset out in the bay again this morning answered Will Scott
5910-53048-0004	train-other-500	That s the second time The Grey Gull picked up the men and towed her in It s no use trying to sail her Lobstermen ain t going to risk their lives in a boat like that How s things over at Blue Point Natty
5910-53048-0005	train-other-500	Pretty well responded Natty laconically Natty never wasted words
none	none	 He had not talked a great deal in his fourteen years of life 
5910-53048-0006	train-other-500	but he was much given to thinking He was rather undersized and insignificant looking but there were a few boys of his own age on the mainland who knew that Natty had muscles Has Everett heard anything from Ottawa about the lighthouse business yet asked Will
5910-53048-0007	train-other-500	Natty shook his head Think he s any chance of getting the app intment queried Adam Lewis Not the ghost of a chance said Cooper Creasy decidedly
none	none	 He s on the wrong side of politics that s what 
5910-53048-0008	train-other-500	Er rather his father was A Tory s son
none	none	 ain t going to get an app intment from a Lib ral government that s what 
5910-53048-0009	train-other-500	mister Barr says that Everett is too young to be trusted in such a responsible position quoted Natty gravely Cooper shrugged his shoulders
none	none	 Mebbe mebbe 
5910-53048-0010	train-other-500	Eighteen is kind of green but everybody knows that Ev s been the real lighthouse keeper for two years since your father took sick Irving Elliott wants that light has wanted it for years and he s a pretty strong pull at headquarters that s what
5910-53048-0011	train-other-500	Barr owes him something for years of hard work at elections I ain t saying anything against Elliott either He s a good man but your father s son ought to have that light as sure as he won t get it that s what
none	none	 Any of you going to take in the sports tomorrow down at Summerside asked Will Scott in order to switch Cooper away from politics 
5910-53048-0012	train-other-500	which were apt to excite him I m going for one said Adam
none	none	 There s to be a yacht race atween the Summerside and Charlottetown boat clubs Yes I am going 
5910-53048-0013	train-other-500	Give you a chance down to the station Natty if you want one Natty shook his head Not going he said briefly You should celebrate Victoria Day said Adam patriotically Twenty fourth o May s the Queen s birthday
none	none	 Ef we don t get a holiday we ll all run away as we used to say at school 
5910-53048-0014	train-other-500	The good old Queen is dead but the day s been app inted a national holiday in honour of her memory and you should celebrate it becoming Natty boy Ev and I can t both go and he s going explained Natty
5910-53048-0015	train-other-500	Prue and I ll stay home to light up Must be getting back now Looks squally I misdoubt if we ll have Queen s weather tomorrow said Cooper squinting critically at the sky Looks like a northeast blow that s what
5910-53048-0016	train-other-500	There goes Bliss striding off and looking pretty mad The Cockawee s a dead loss to him that s what Nat s off he knows how to handle a boat middling well too
none	none	 Pity he s such a puny youngster 
5910-53048-0017	train-other-500	Not much to him I reckon Natty had cast loose in his boat the Merry Maid and hoisted his sail In a few minutes he was skimming gaily down the bay The wind was fair and piping and the Merry Maid went like a bird
5910-53048-0018	train-other-500	Natty at the rudder steered for Blue Point Island a reflective frown on his face He was feeling in no mood for Victoria Day sports In a very short time he and Ev and Prue
5910-53048-0019	train-other-500	must leave Blue Point lighthouse where they had lived all their lives To Natty it seemed as if the end of all things would come then Where would life be worth living away from lonely windy Blue Point Island
5910-53048-0020	train-other-500	David Miller had died the preceding winter after a long illness
none	none	 He had been lighthouse keeper at Blue Point for thirty years 
5910-53048-0021	train-other-500	His three children had been born and brought up there and there four years ago the mother had died But womanly little Prue had taken her place well and the boys were devoted to their sister When their father died
5910-53048-0022	train-other-500	Everett had applied for the position of lighthouse keeper The matter was not yet publicly decided but old Cooper Creasy had sized the situation up accurately The Millers had no real hope that Everett would be appointed
5910-53048-0023	train-other-500	Victoria Day while not absolutely stormy
none	none	 proved to be rather unpleasant 
5910-53048-0024	train-other-500	A choppy northeast wind blew up the bay and the water was rough enough The sky was overcast with clouds and the May air was raw and chilly At Blue Point the Millers were early astir
5910-53048-0025	train-other-500	for if Everett wanted to sail over to the mainland in time to catch the excursion train no morning naps were permissible He was going alone Since only one of the boys could go Natty had insisted that it should be Everett
5910-53048-0026	train-other-500	and Prue had elected to stay home with Natty Prue had small heart for Victoria Day that year She did not feel even a thrill of enthusiasm when Natty hoisted a flag and wreathed the Queen s picture with creeping spruce
5910-53048-0027	train-other-500	Prue felt as badly about leaving Blue Point Island as the boys did The day passed slowly In the afternoon the wind fell away to a dead calm but there was still a heavy swell on
5910-53048-0028	train-other-500	and shortly before sunset a fog came creeping up from the east and spread over the bay and islands so thick and white that Prue and Natty could not even see Little Bear Island on the right I m glad Everett isn t coming back tonight said Prue
5910-53048-0029	train-other-500	He could never find his way cross the harbour in that fog Isn t it thick though said Natty The light won t show far tonight At sunset they lighted the great lamps and then settled down to an evening of reading
5910-53048-0030	train-other-500	But it was not long before Natty looked up from his book to say Hello Prue what was that Thought I heard a noise So did I
none	none	 said Prue I sounded like someone calling 
5910-53048-0031	train-other-500	They hurried to the door which looked out on the harbour The night owing to the fog was dark with a darkness that seemed almost tangible From somewhere out of that darkness came a muffled shouting
5910-53048-0032	train-other-500	like that of a person in distress Prue there s somebody in trouble out there exclaimed Natty Oh it s surely never Ev cried Prue Natty shook his head Don t think so
5910-53048-0033	train-other-500	Ev had no intention of coming back tonight Get that lantern Prue I must go and see what and who it is Oh Natty you mustn t cried Prue in distress There s a heavy swell on yet and the fog oh if you get lost
5910-53048-0034	train-other-500	I ll not get lost and I must go Prue Maybe somebody is drowning out there It s not Ev of course
none	none	 but suppose it were That s a good girl 
5910-53048-0035	train-other-500	Prue with set face had brought the lantern resolutely choking back the words of fear and protest that rushed to her lips They hurried down to the shore and Natty sprang into the little skiff he used for rowing
5910-53048-0036	train-other-500	He hastily lashed the lantern in the stern cast loose the painter and lifted the oars I ll be back as soon as possible he called to Prue Wait here for me In a minute the shore was out of sight and Natty found himself alone in the black fog
none	none	 with no guide but the cries for help 
5910-53048-0037	train-other-500	which already were becoming fainter They seemed to come from the direction of Little Bear and thither Natty rowed It was a tough pull and the water was rough enough for the little dory
5910-53048-0038	train-other-500	But Natty had been at home with the oars from babyhood and his long training and tough sinews stood him in good stead now Steadily and intrepidly he rowed along
5910-53048-0039	train-other-500	The water grew rougher as he passed out from the shelter of Blue Point into the channel between the latter and Little Bear The cries were becoming very faint What if he should be too late
5910-53048-0040	train-other-500	He bent to the oars with all his energy Presently by the smoother water he knew he must be in the lea of Little Bear The cries sounded nearer He must already have rowed nearly a mile
5910-53048-0041	train-other-500	The next minute he shot around a small headland and right before him dimly visible in the faint light cast by the lantern through the fog was an upturned boat with two men clinging to it one on each side evidently almost exhausted
none	none	 Natty rowed cautiously up to the one nearest him 
5910-53048-0042	train-other-500	knowing that he must be wary lest the grip of the drowning man overturn his own light skiff Let go when I say he shouted and don t grab anything do you hear Don t grab Now let go
5910-53048-0043	train-other-500	The next minute the man lay in the dory dragged over the stern by Netty s grip on his collar Lie still ordered Natty clutching the oars To row around the overturned boat amid the swirl of water about her
5910-53048-0044	train-other-500	was a task that taxed Netty s skill and strength to the utmost The other man was dragged in over the bow and with a gasp of relief Natty pulled away from the sinking boat Once clear of her he could not row for a few minutes
5910-53048-0045	train-other-500	he was shaking from head to foot with the reaction from tremendous effort and strain This ll never do he muttered I m not going to be a baby now But will I ever be able to row back Presently however
5910-53048-0046	train-other-500	he was able to grip his oars again and pull for the lighthouse whose beacon loomed dimly through the fog like a great blur of whiter mist The men obedient to his orders lay quietly where he had placed them and before long
5910-53048-0047	train-other-500	Natty was back again at the lighthouse landing where Prue was waiting wild with anxiety
none	none	 The men were helped out and assisted up to the lighthouse where Natty went to hunt up dry clothes for them 
5910-53048-0048	train-other-500	and Prue flew about to prepare hot drinks To think that that child saved us exclaimed one of the men
none	none	 Why I didn t think a grown man had the strength to do what he did He is your brother I suppose Miss Miller 
5910-53048-0049	train-other-500	You have another brother I think Oh yes Everett but he is away explained Prue We heard your shouts and Natty insisted on going at once to your rescue Well he came just in time
5910-53048-0050	train-other-500	I couldn t have held on another minute was so done up I couldn t have moved or spoken all the way here even if he hadn t commanded me to keep perfectly still Natty returned at this moment and exclaimed Why it is mister Barr
5910-53048-0051	train-other-500	I didn t recognize you before Barr it is young man This gentleman is my friend mister Blackmore We have been celebrating Victoria Day by a shooting tramp over Little Bear We hired a boat from Ford at the Harbour Head this morning
5910-53048-0052	train-other-500	the Cockawee he called her and sailed over I don t know much about running a boat but Blackmore here thinks he does We were at the other side of the island when the fog came up We hurried across it
none	none	 but it was almost dark when we reached our boat 
5910-53048-0053	train-other-500	We sailed around the point and then the boat just simply upset don t know why But I know why interrupted Natty indignantly That Cockawee does nothing but upset
none	none	 She has turned turtle twice out in the harbour in fine weather 
5910-53048-0054	train-other-500	Ford was a rascal to let her to you He might have known what would happen Why why it was almost murder to let you go I thought there must be something queer about her declared mister Blackmore
5910-53048-0055	train-other-500	I do know how to handle a boat despite my friend s gibe
none	none	 and there was no reason why she should have upset like that 
5910-53048-0056	train-other-500	That Ford ought to be horsewhipped Thanks to Prue s stinging hot decoctions of black currant drink the two gentlemen were no worse for their drenching and exposure and the next morning
5910-53048-0057	train-other-500	Natty took them to the mainland in the Merry Maid When he parted with them mister Barr shook his hand heartily and said Thank you my boy You re a plucky youngster and a skilful one too
5910-53048-0058	train-other-500	Tell your brother that if I can get the Blue Point lighthouse berth for him I will and as for yourself
none	none	 you will always find a friend in me and if I can ever do anything for you I will 
5910-53048-0059	train-other-500	Two weeks later Everett received an official document formally appointing him keeper of Blue Point Island light
none	none	 Natty carried the news to the mainland 
5910-53048-0060	train-other-500	where it was joyfully received among the fishermen Only right and fair said Cooper Creasy Blue Point without a Miller to light up wouldn t seem the thing at all that s what And it s nothing but Ev s doo
none	none	 Guess Natty had more to do with it than Ev 
5910-53048-0061	train-other-500	said Adam perpetrating a very poor pun and being immensely applauded therefor It keyed Will Scott up to rival Adam You said that Irving had a pull and the Millers hadn t he said jocularly
5910-53048-0062	train-other-500	But it looks as if twas Natty s pull did the business after all his pull over to Bear Island and back It was about a miracle that a boy could do what he did on such a night said Charles Macey Where s Ford asked Natty uncomfortably
5910-53048-0063	train-other-500	He hated to have his exploit talked about Ford has cleared out said Cooper gone down to Summerside to go into Tobe Meekins s factory there Best thing he could do that s what Folks here hadn t no use for him
5910-53048-0064	train-other-500	after letting that death trap to them two men even if they was Lib rals The Cockawee druv ashore on Little Bear and there she s going to remain I guess D ye want a berth in my mackerel boat this summer Natty
5910-53048-0065	train-other-500	I do said Natty but I thought you said you were full I guess I can make room for you said Cooper A boy with such grit and muscle ain t to be allowed to go to seed on Blue Point that s what Yesser we ll make room for you
none	none	 And Natty s cup of happiness was full Penelope s Party Waist It s perfectly horrid to be so poor grumbled Penelope Penelope did not often grumble but just now as she sat tapping with one pink tipped finger her invitation to Blanche Anderson s party she felt that grumbling was the only relief she had Penelope was seventeen and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a party because one hasn t a suitable dress to wear the world is very apt to seem a howling wilderness I wish I could think of some way to get you a new waist said Doris with what these sisters called the poverty pucker coming in the centre of her pretty forehead If your black skirt were sponged and pressed and re hung it would do very well Penelope saw the poverty pucker and immediately repented with all her impetuous heart having grumbled That pucker came often enough without being brought there by extra worries Well there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable she said jumping up briskly I d better be putting my grey matter into that algebra instead of wasting it plotting for a party dress that I certainly can t get It s a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isn t it If I could only absorb algebra and history as I can music what a blessing it would be Come now Dorrie dear smooth that pucker out Next year I shall be earning a princely salary which we can squander on party gowns at will if people haven t given up inviting us by that time in sheer despair of ever being able to conquer our exclusiveness Penelope went off to her detested algebra with a laugh but the pucker did not go out of Doris forehead She wanted Penelope to go to that party Penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasn t gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully She is getting discouraged over those examinations and she needs just a good jolly time to hearten her up If it could only be managed But Doris did not see how it could It took every cent of her small salary as typewriter in an uptown office to run their tiny establishment and keep Penelope in school dresses and books Indeed she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their little cottage Next year it would be easier if Penelope got through her examinations successfully but just now there was absolutely not a spare penny It is hard to be poor We are a pair of misfits said Doris with a patient little smile thinking of Penelope s uncultivated talent for music and her own housewifely gifts which had small chance of flowering out in her business life Doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day So it must be confessed did Penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world When Doris reached home the next evening she found Penelope hovering over a bulky parcel on the sitting room table I m so glad you ve come she said with an exaggerated gasp of relief I really don t think my curiosity could have borne the strain for another five minutes The expressman brought this parcel an hour ago and there s a letter for you from Aunt Adella on the clock shelf and I think they belong to each other Hurry up and find out Dorrie darling what if it should be a a present of some sort or other I suppose it can t be anything else smiled Doris She knew that Penelope had started out to say a new dress She cut the strings and removed the wrappings Both girls stared Is it it isn t yes it is Doris Hunter I believe it s an old quilt Doris unfolded the odd present with a queer feeling of disappointment She did not know just what she had expected the package to contain but certainly not this She laughed a little shakily Well we can t say after this that Aunt Adella never gave us anything she said when she had opened her letter Listen Penelope My Dear Doris I have decided to give up housekeeping and go out West to live with Robert So I am disposing of such of the family heirlooms as I do not wish to take with me I am sending you by express your Grandmother Hunter s silk quilt It is a handsome article still and I hope you will prize it as you should It took your grandmother five years to make it There is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in it Love to Penelope and yourself Your affectionate aunt Adella Hunter I don t see its beauty said Penelope with a grimace It may have been pretty once but it is all faded now It is a monument of patience though The pattern is what they call Little Thousands isn t it Tell me Dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that I can t feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom especially when Grandmother Hunter died years before I was born It was very kind of Aunt Adella to send it said Doris dutifully Oh very agreed Penelope drolly Only don t ever ask me to sleep under it It would give me the nightmare O o h This last was a little squeal of admiration as Doris turned the quilt over and brought to view the shimmering lining Why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed Penelope What lovely old timey stuff And not a bit faded The lining was certainly very pretty It was a soft creamy yellow silk with a design of brocaded pink rosebuds all over it That was a dress Grandmother Hunter had when she was a girl said Doris absently I remember hearing Aunt Adella speak of it When it became old fashioned Grandmother used it to line her quilt I declare it is as good as new Well let us go and have tea said Penelope I m decidedly hungry Besides I see the poverty pucker coming Put the quilt in the spare room It is something to possess an heirloom after all It gives one a nice important family feeling After tea when Penelope was patiently grinding away at her studies and thinking dolefully enough of the near approaching examinations which she dreaded and of teaching which she confidently expected to hate Doris went up to the tiny spare room to look at the wrong side of the quilt again It would make the loveliest party waist she said under her breath Creamy yellow is Penelope s colour and I could use that bit of old black lace and those knots of velvet ribbon that I have to trim it I wonder if Grandmother Hunter s reproachful spirit will forever haunt me if I do it Doris knew very well that she would do it had known it ever since she had looked at that lovely lining and a vision of Penelope s vivid face and red brown hair rising above a waist of the quaint old silk had flashed before her mental sight That night after Penelope had gone to bed Doris ripped the lining out of Grandmother Hunter s silk quilt If Aunt Adella saw me now she laughed softly to herself as she worked In the three following evenings Doris made the waist She thought it a wonderful bit of good luck that Penelope went out each of the evenings to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum It will be such a nice surprise for her the sister mused jubilantly Penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when Doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet Doris Hunter you are a veritable little witch Do you mean to tell me that you conjured that perfectly lovely thing for me out of the lining of Grandmother Hunter s quilt So Penelope went to Blanche s party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there missus Fairweather who was visiting missus Anderson looked closely at it also She was a very sweet old lady with silver hair which she wore in delightful old fashioned puffs and she had very bright dark eyes Penelope thought her altogether charming She looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself I wish she belonged to me I d just love to have a grandmother like her And I do wonder who it is I ve seen who looks so much like her A little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly and she thought with inward surprise Why it is Doris of course If my sister Doris lives to be seventy years old and wears her hair in pretty white puffs she will look exactly as missus Fairweather does now missus Fairweather asked to have Penelope introduced to her and when they found themselves alone together she said gently My dear I am going to ask a very impertinent question Will you tell me where you got the silk of which your waist is made Poor Penelope s pretty young face turned crimson She was not troubled with false pride by any means but she simply could not bring herself to tell missus Fairweather that her waist was made out of the lining of an old heirloom quilt My Aunt Adella gave me gave us the material she stammered And my elder sister Doris made the waist for me I think the silk once belonged to my Grandmother Hunter What was your grandmother s maiden name asked missus Fairweather eagerly Penelope Saverne I am named after her missus Fairweather suddenly put her arm about Penelope and drew the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness Then you are my grandniece she said Your grandmother was my half sister When I saw your dress I felt sure you were related to her I should recognize that rosebud silk if I came across it in Thibet Penelope Saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first husband Penelope was four years older than I was but we were devoted to each other Oddly enough our birthdays fell on the same day and when Penelope was twenty and I sixteen my father gave us each a silk dress of this very material I have mine yet Soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up Penelope went to live with her aunt and I went West with Father This was long ago you know when travelling and correspondence were not the easy matter of course things they are now After a few years I lost touch with my half sister I married out West and have lived there all my life I never knew what had become of Penelope But tonight when I saw you come in in that waist made of the rosebud silk the whole past rose before me and I felt like a girl again My dear I am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me You don t know how delighted I am to find that I have two grandnieces Penelope had listened silently like a girl in a dream Now she patted missus Fairweather s soft old hand affectionately It sounds like a storybook she said gaily You must come and see Doris She is such a darling sister I wouldn t have had this waist if it hadn t been for her I will tell you the whole truth I don t mind it now Doris made my party waist for me out of the lining of an old silk quilt of Grandmother Hunter s that Aunt Adella sent us missus Fairweather did go to see Doris the very next day and quite wonderful things came to pass from that interview Doris and Penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye They were both to go and live with Aunt Esther as missus Fairweather had said they must call her Penelope was to have at last her longed for musical education and Doris was to be the home girl You must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter said Aunt Esther She died six years ago and I have been so lonely since When missus Fairweather had gone Doris and Penelope looked at each other Pinch me please said Penelope I m half afraid I ll wake up and find I have been dreaming Isn t it all wonderful Doris Hunter Doris nodded radiantly Oh Penelope think of it Music for you somebody to pet and fuss over for me and such a dear sweet aunty for us both And no more contriving party waists out of old silk linings laughed Penelope But it was very fortunate that you did it for once sister mine And no more poverty puckers she concluded The Girl and The Wild Race If Judith would only get married missus Theodora Whitney was wont to sigh dolorously Now there was no valid reason why Judith ought to get married unless she wanted to But Judith was twenty seven and missus Theodora thought it was a terrible disgrace to be an old maid There has never been an old maid in our family so far back as we know of she lamented And to think that there should be one now It just drags us down to the level of the McGregors They have always been noted for their old maids Judith took all her aunt s lamentations good naturedly Sometimes she argued the subject placidly Why are you in such a hurry to be rid of me Aunt Theo I m sure we re very comfortable here together and you know you would miss me terribly if I went away If you took the right one you wouldn t go so very far said missus Theodora darkly significant And anyhow I d put up with any amount of lonesomeness rather than have an old maid in the family It s all very fine now when you re still young enough and good looking with lots of beaus at your beck and call But that won t last much longer and if you go on with your dilly dallying you ll wake up some fine day to find that your time for choosing has gone by Your mother used to be dreadful proud of your good looks when you was a baby I told her she needn t be Nine times out of ten a beauty don t marry as well as an ordinary girl I m not much set on marrying at all declared Judith sharply Any reference to the right one always disturbed her placidity The real root of the trouble was that missus Theodora s right one and Judith s right one were two different people The Ramble Valley young men were very fond of dancing attendance on Judith even if she were verging on old maidenhood Her prettiness was undeniable the Stewarts came to maturity late and at twenty seven Judith s dower of milky white flesh dimpled red lips and shining bronze hair was at its fullest splendor Besides she was jolly and jollity went a long way in Ramble Valley popularity Of all Judith s admirers Eben King alone found favor in missus Theodora s eyes He owned the adjoining farm was well off and homely so homely that Judith declared it made her eyes ache to look at him Bruce Marshall Judith s right one was handsome but missus Theodora looked upon him with sour disapproval He owned a stony little farm at the remote end of Ramble Valley and was reputed to be fonder of many things than of work To be sure Judith had enough capability and energy for two but missus Theodora detested a lazy man She ordered Judith not to encourage him and Judith obeyed Judith generally obeyed her aunt but though she renounced Bruce Marshall she would have nothing to do with Eben King or anybody else and all missus Theodora s grumblings did not mend matters The afternoon that missus Tony Mack came in missus Theodora felt more aggrieved than ever Ellie McGregor had been married the previous week Ellie who was the same age as Judith and not half so good looking missus Theodora had been nagging Judith ever since But I might as well talk to the trees down there in that hollow she complained to missus Tony That girl is so set and contrary minded She doesn t care a bit for my feelings This was not said behind Judith s back The girl herself was standing at the open door drinking in all the delicate evasive beauty of the spring afternoon The Whitney house crested a bare hill that looked down on misty intervals feathered with young firs that were golden green in the pale sunlight The fields were bare and smoking although the lanes and shadowy places were full of moist snow Judith s face was aglow with the delight of mere life and she bent out to front the brisk dancing wind that blew up from the valley resinous with the odors of firs and damp mosses At her aunt s words the glow went out of her face She listened with her eyes brooding on the hollow and a glowing flame of temper smouldering in them Judith s long patience was giving way She had been flicked on the raw too often of late And now her aunt was confiding her grievances to missus Tony Mack the most notorious gossip in Ramble Valley or out of it I can t sleep at nights for worrying over what will become of her when I m gone went on missus Theodora dismally She ll just have to live on alone here a lonesome withered up old maid And her that might have had her pick missus Tony though I do say it as shouldn t You must feel real thankful to have all your girls married off especially when none of them was extry good looking Some people have all the luck I m tired of talking to Judith Folks ll be saying soon that nobody ever really wanted her for all her flirting But she just won t marry I will Judith whirled about on the sun warm door step and came in Her black eyes were flashing and her round cheeks were crimson Such a temper you never saw reported missus Tony afterwards Though tweren t to be wondered at Theodora was most awful aggravating I will repeated Judith stormily I m tired of being nagged day in and day out I ll marry and what is more I ll marry the very first man that asks me that I will if it is old Widower Delane himself How does that suit you Aunt Theodora missus Theodora s mental processes were never slow She dropped her knitting ball and stooped for it In that time she had decided what to do She knew that Judith would stick to her word Stewart like and she must trim her sails to catch this new wind It suits me real well Judith she said calmly you can marry the first man that asks you and I ll say no word to hinder The color went out of Judith s face leaving it pale as ashes Her hasty assertion had no sooner been uttered than it was repented of but she must stand by it now She went out of the kitchen without another glance at her aunt or the delighted missus Tony and dashed up the stairs to her own little room which looked out over the whole of Ramble Valley It was warm with the March sunshine and the leafless boughs of the creeper that covered the end of the house were tapping a gay tattoo on the window panes to the music of the wind Judith sat down in her little rocker and dropped her pointed chin in her hands Far down the valley over the firs on the McGregor hill and the blue mirror of the Cranston pond Bruce Marshall s little gray house peeped out from a semicircle of white stemmed birches She had not seen Bruce since before Christmas He had been angry at her then because she had refused to let him drive her home from prayer meeting Since then she had heard a rumor that he was going to see Kitty Leigh at the Upper Valley Judith looked sombrely down at the Marshall homestead She had always loved the quaint picturesque old place so different from all the commonplace spick and span new houses of the prosperous valley Judith had never been able to decide whether she really cared very much for Bruce Marshall or not but she knew that she loved that rambling cornery house of his with the gable festooned with the real ivy that Bruce Marshall s great grandmother had brought with her from England Judith thought contrastingly of Eben King s staring primrose colored house in all its bare intrusive grandeur She gave a little shrug of distaste I wish Bruce knew of this she thought flushing even in her solitude at the idea Although if it is true that he is going to see Kitty Leigh I don t suppose he d care And Aunt Theo will be sure to send word to Eben by hook or crook Whatever possessed me to say such a mad thing There goes missus Tony now all agog to spread such a delectable bit of gossip missus Tony had indeed gone refusing missus Theodora s invitation to stay to tea so eager was she to tell her story And missus Theodora at that very minute was out in her kitchen yard giving her instructions to Potter Vane the twelve year old urchin who cut her wood and did sundry other chores for her Potter she said excitedly run over to the Kings and tell Eben to come over here immediately no matter what he s at Tell him I want to see him about something of the greatest importance missus Theodora thought that this was a master stroke That match is as good as made she thought triumphantly as she picked up chips to start the tea fire If Judith suspects that Eben is here she is quite likely to stay in her room and refuse to come down But if she does I ll march him upstairs to her door and make him ask her through the keyhole You can t stump Theodora Whitney Alas Ten minutes later Potter returned with the unwelcome news that Eben was away from home He went to Wexbridge about half an hour ago his ma said She said she d tell him to come right over as soon as he kem home missus Theodora had to content herself with this but she felt troubled She knew missus Tony Mack s capabilities for spreading news What if Bruce Marshall should hear it before Eben That evening Jacob Plowden s store at Wexbridge was full of men sitting about on kegs and counters or huddling around the stove for the March air had grown sharp as the sun lowered in the creamy sky over the Ramble Valley hills Eben King had a keg in the corner He was in no hurry to go home for he loved gossip dearly and the Wexbridge stores abounded with it He had exhausted the news of Peter Stanley s store across the bridge and now he meant to hear what was saying at Plowden s Bruce Marshall was there too buying groceries and being waited on by Nora Plowden who was by no means averse to the service although as a rule her father s customers received scanty tolerance at her hands What are the Valley roads like Marshall asked a Wexbridge man between two squirts of tobacco juice Bad said Bruce briefly Another warm day will finish the sleighing Are they crossing at Malley s Creek yet asked Plowden No Jack Carr got in there day before yesterday Nearly lost his mare I came round by the main road responded Bruce The door opened at this point and Tony Mack came in As soon as he closed the door he doubled up in a fit of chuckles which lasted until he was purple in the face Is the man crazy demanded Plowden who had never seen lean little Tony visited like this before Crazy nothin retorted Tony You ll laugh too when you hear it Such a joke Hee tee tee hee e Theodora Whitney has been badgering Judith Stewart so much about bein an old maid that Judith s got mad and vowed she ll marry the first man that asks her Hee tee tee hee e e e My old woman was there and heard her She ll keep her word too She ain t old Joshua Stewart s daughter for nothin If he said he d do a thing he did it if it tuck the hair off If I was a young feller now Hee tee tee hee e e e Bruce Marshall swung round on one foot His face was crimson and if looks could kill Tony Mack would have fallen dead in the middle of his sniggers You needn t mind doing up that parcel for me he said to Nora I ll not wait for it On his way to the door Eben King brushed past him A shout of laughter from the assembled men followed them The others streamed out in their wake realizing that a race was afoot Tony alone remained inside helpless with chuckling Eben King s horse was tied at the door He had nothing to do but step in and drive off Bruce had put his mare in at Billy Bender s across the bridge intending to spend the evening there He knew that this would handicap him seriously but he strode down the road with a determined expression on his handsome face Fifteen minutes later he drove past the store his gray mare going at a sharp gait The crowd in front of Plowden s cheered him their sympathies were with him for King was not popular Tony had come out and shouted Here s luck to you brother after which he doubled up with renewed laughter Such a lark And he Tony had set it afoot It would be a story to tell for years Marshall with his lips set and his dreamy gray eyes for once glittering with a steely light urged Lady Jane up the Wexbridge hill From its top it was five miles to Ramble Valley by the main road A full mile ahead of him he saw Eben King getting along through mud and slush and occasional big slumpy drifts of old snow as fast as his clean limbed trotter could carry him As a rule Eben was exceedingly careful of his horses but now he was sending Bay Billy along for all that was in him For a second Bruce hesitated Then he turned his mare down the field cut to Malley s Creek It was taking Lady Jane s life and possibly his own in his hand but it was his only chance He could never have overtaken Bay Billy on the main road Do your best Lady Jane he muttered and Lady Jane plunged down the steep hillside through the glutinous mud of a ploughed field as if she meant to do it Beyond the field was a ravine full of firs through which Malley s Creek ran To cross it meant a four mile cut to Ramble Valley The ice looked black and rotten To the left was the ragged hole where Jack Carr s mare had struggled for her life Bruce headed Lady Jane higher up If a crossing could be made at all it was only between Malley s spring hole and the old ice road Lady Jane swerved at the bank and whickered On old girl said Bruce in a tense voice Unwillingly she advanced picking her steps with cat like sagacity Once her foot went through Bruce pulled her up with hands that did not tremble The next moment she was scrambling up the opposite bank Glancing back Bruce saw the ice parting in her footprints and the black water gurgling up But the race was not yet decided By crossing the creek he had won no more than an equal chance with Eben King And the field road before him was much worse than the main road There was little snow on it and some bad sloughs But Lady Jane was good for it For once she should not be spared Just as the red ball of the sun touched the wooded hills of the valley missus Theodora looking from the cowstable door saw two sleighs approaching the horses of which were going at a gallop One was trundling down the main road headlong through old drifts and slumpy snow where a false step might send the horse floundering to the bottom The other was coming up from the direction of the creek full tilt through Tony Mack s stump land where not a vestige of snow coated the huge roots over which the runners bumped For a moment missus Theodora stood at a gaze Then she recognized both drivers She dropped her milking pail and ran to the house thinking as she ran She knew that Judith was alone in the kitchen If Eben King got there first well and good but if Bruce Marshall won the race he must encounter her missus Theodora He won t propose to Judith as long as I m round she panted I know him he s too shy But Eben won t mind I ll tip him the wink Potter Vane was chopping wood before the door missus Theodora recognizing in him a further obstacle to Marshall s wooing caught him unceremoniously by the arm and hauled him axe and all over the doorstone and into the kitchen just as Bruce Marshall and Eben King drove into the yard with not a second to spare between them There was a woeful cut on Bay Billy s slender foreleg and the reeking Lady Jane was trembling like a leaf The staunch little mare had brought her master over that stretch of sticky field road in time but she was almost exhausted Both men sprang from their sleighs and ran to the door Bruce Marshall won it by foot room and burst into the kitchen with his rival hot on his heels missus Theodora stood defiantly in the middle of the room still grasping the dazed and dismayed Potter In a corner Judith turned from the window whence she had been watching the finish of the race She was pale and tense from excitement In those few gasping moments she had looked on her heart as on an open book she knew at last that she loved Bruce Marshall and her eyes met his fiery gray ones as he sprang over the threshold Judith will you marry me gasped Bruce before Eben who had first looked at missus Theodora and the squirming Potter had located the girl Yes said Judith She burst into hysterical tears as she said it and sat limply down in a chair missus Theodora loosed her grip on Potter You can go back to your work she said dully She followed him out and Eben King followed her On the step she reached behind him and closed the door Trust a King for being too late she said bitterly and unjustly Eben went home with Bay Billy Potter gazed after him until missus Theodora ordered him to put Marshall s mare in the stable and rub her down Anyway Judith won t be an old maid she comforted herself The Promise of Lucy Ellen Cecily Foster came down the sloping fir fringed road from the village at a leisurely pace Usually she walked with a long determined stride but to day the drowsy mellowing influence of the Autumn afternoon was strong upon her and filled her with placid content Without being actively conscious of it she was satisfied with the existing circumstances of her life It was half over now The half of it yet to be lived stretched before her tranquil pleasant and uneventful like the afternoon filled with unhurried duties and calmly interesting days Cecily liked the prospect When she came to her own lane she paused folding her hands on the top of the whitewashed gate while she basked for a moment in the warmth that seemed cupped in the little grassy hollow hedged about with young fir trees Before her lay sere brooding fields sloping down to a sandy shore where long foamy ripples were lapping with a murmur that threaded the hushed air like a faint minor melody On the crest of the little hill to her right was her home hers and Lucy Ellen s The house was an old fashioned weather gray one low in the eaves with gables and porches overgrown with vines that had turned to wine reds and rich bronzes in the October frosts On three sides it was closed in by tall old spruces their outer sides bared and grim from long wrestling with the Atlantic winds but their inner green and feathery On the fourth side a trim white paling shut in the flower garden before the front door Cecily could see the beds of purple and scarlet asters making rich whorls of color under the parlor and sitting room windows Lucy Ellen s bed was gayer and larger than Cecily s Lucy Ellen had always had better luck with flowers She could see old Boxer asleep on the front porch step and Lucy Ellen s white cat stretched out on the parlor window sill There was no other sign of life about the place Cecily drew a long leisurely breath of satisfaction After tea I ll dig up those dahlia roots she said aloud They d ought to be up My how blue and soft that sea is I never saw such a lovely day I ve been gone longer than I expected I wonder if Lucy Ellen s been lonesome When Cecily looked back from the misty ocean to the house she was surprised to see a man coming with a jaunty step down the lane under the gnarled spruces She looked at him perplexedly He must be a stranger for she was sure no man in Oriental walked like that Some agent has been pestering Lucy Ellen I suppose she muttered vexedly The stranger came on with an airy briskness utterly foreign to Orientalites Cecily opened the gate and went through They met under the amber tinted sugar maple in the heart of the hollow As he passed the man lifted his hat and bowed with an ingratiating smile He was about forty five well although somewhat loudly dressed and with an air of self satisfied prosperity pervading his whole personality He had a heavy gold watch chain and a large seal ring on the hand that lifted his hat He was bald with a high Shaksperian forehead and a halo of sandy curls His face was ruddy and weak but good natured his eyes were large and blue and he had a little straw colored moustache with a juvenile twist and curl in it Cecily did not recognize him yet there was something vaguely familiar about him She walked rapidly up to the house In the sitting room she found Lucy Ellen peering out between the muslin window curtains When the latter turned there was an air of repressed excitement about her Who was that man Lucy Ellen Cecily asked To Cecily s amazement Lucy Ellen blushed a warm Spring like flood of color that rolled over her delicate little face like a miracle of rejuvenescence Didn t you know him That was Cromwell Biron she simpered Although Lucy Ellen was forty and in most respects sensible she could not help simpering upon occasion Cromwell Biron repeated Cecily in an emotionless voice She took off her bonnet mechanically brushed the dust from its ribbons and bows and went to put it carefully away in its white box in the spare bedroom She felt as if she had had a severe shock and she dared not ask anything more just then Lucy Ellen s blush had frightened her It seemed to open up dizzying possibilities of change But she promised she promised said Cecily fiercely under her breath While Cecily was changing her dress Lucy Ellen was getting the tea ready in the little kitchen Now and then she broke out into singing but always checked herself guiltily Cecily heard her and set her firm mouth a little firmer If a man had jilted me twenty years ago I wouldn t be so overwhelmingly glad to see him when he came back especially if he had got fat and bald headed she added her face involuntarily twitching into a smile Cecily in spite of her serious expression and intense way of looking at life had an irrepressible sense of humor Tea that evening was not the pleasant meal it usually was The two women were wont to talk animatedly to each other and Cecily had many things to tell Lucy Ellen She did not tell them Neither did Lucy Ellen ask any questions her ill concealed excitement hanging around her like a festal garment Cecily s heart was on fire with alarm and jealousy She smiled a little cruelly as she buttered and ate her toast And so that was Cromwell Biron she said with studied carelessness I thought there was something familiar about him When did he come home He got to Oriental yesterday fluttered back Lucy Ellen He s going to be home for two months We we had such an interesting talk this afternoon He he s as full of jokes as ever I wished you d been here This was a fib Cecily knew it I don t then she said contemptuously You know I never had much use for Cromwell Biron I think he had a face of his own to come down here to see you uninvited after the way he treated you Lucy Ellen blushed scorchingly and was miserably silent He s changed terrible in his looks went on Cecily relentlessly How bald he s got and fat To think of the spruce Cromwell Biron got to be bald and fat To be sure he still has the same sheepish expression Will you pass me the currant jell Lucy Ellen I don t think he s so very fat she said resentfully when Cecily had left the table And I don t care if he is Twenty years before this Biron had jilted Lucy Ellen Foster She was the prettiest girl in Oriental then but the new school teacher over at the Crossways was prettier with a dash of piquancy which Lucy Ellen lacked into the bargain Cromwell and the school teacher had run away and been married and Lucy Ellen was left to pick up the tattered shreds of her poor romance as best she could She never had another lover She told herself that she would always be faithful to the one love of her life This sounded romantic and she found a certain comfort in it She had been brought up by her uncle and aunt When they died she and her cousin Cecily Foster found themselves except for each other alone in the world Cecily loved Lucy Ellen as a sister But she believed that Lucy Ellen would yet marry and her heart sank at the prospect of being left without a soul to love and care for It was Lucy Ellen that had first proposed their mutual promise but Cecily had grasped at it eagerly The two women verging on decisive old maidenhood solemnly promised each other that they would never marry and would always live together From that time Cecily s mind had been at ease In her eyes a promise was a sacred thing The next evening at prayer meeting Cromwell Biron received quite an ovation from old friends and neighbors Cromwell had been a favorite in his boyhood He had now the additional glamour of novelty and reputed wealth He was beaming and expansive He went into the choir to help sing Lucy Ellen sat beside him and they sang from the same book Two red spots burned on her thin cheeks and she had a cluster of lavender chrysanthemums pinned on her jacket She looked almost girlish and Cromwell Biron gazed at her with sidelong admiration while Cecily watched them both fiercely from her pew She knew that Cromwell Biron had come home wooing his old love But he sha n t get her Cecily whispered into her hymnbook Somehow it was a comfort to articulate the words She promised On the church steps Cromwell offered his arm to Lucy Ellen with a flourish She took it shyly and they started down the road in the crisp Autumn moonlight For the first time in ten years Cecily walked home from prayer meeting alone She went up stairs and flung herself on her bed reckless for once of her second best hat and gown Lucy Ellen did not venture to ask Cromwell in She was too much in awe of Cecily for that But she loitered with him at the gate until the grandfather s clock in the hall struck eleven Then Cromwell went away whistling gaily with Lucy Ellen s chrysanthemum in his buttonhole and Lucy Ellen went in and cried half the night But Cecily did not cry She lay savagely awake until morning Cromwell Biron is courting you again she said bluntly to Lucy Ellen at the breakfast table Lucy Ellen blushed nervously Oh nonsense Cecily she protested with a simper It isn t nonsense said Cecily calmly He is There is no fool like an old fool and Cromwell Biron never had much sense The presumption of him Lucy Ellen s hands trembled as she put her teacup down He s not so very old she said faintly and everybody but you likes him and he s well to do I don t see that there s any presumption Maybe not if you look at it so You re very forgiving Lucy Ellen You ve forgotten how he treated you once No o o I haven t faltered Lucy Ellen Anyway said Cecily coldly you shouldn t encourage his attentions Lucy Ellen you know you couldn t marry him even if he asked you You promised All the fitful color went out of Lucy Ellen s face Under Cecily s pitiless eyes she wilted and drooped I know she said deprecatingly I haven t forgotten You are talking nonsense Cecily I like to see Cromwell and he likes to see me because I m almost the only one of his old set that is left He feels lonesome in Oriental now Lucy Ellen lifted her fawn colored little head more erectly at the last of her protest She had saved her self respect In the month that followed Cromwell Biron pressed his suit persistently unintimidated by Cecily s antagonism October drifted into November and the chill drear days came To Cecily the whole outer world seemed the dismal reflex of her pain bitten heart Yet she constantly laughed at herself too and her laughter was real if bitter One evening she came home late from a neighbor s Cromwell Biron passed her in the hollow under the bare boughs of the maple that were outlined against the silvery moonlit sky When Cecily went into the house Lucy Ellen opened the parlor door She was very pale but her eyes burned in her face and her hands were clasped before her I wish you d come in here for a few minutes Cecily she said feverishly Cecily followed silently into the room Cecily she said faintly Cromwell was here to night He asked me to marry him I told him to come to morrow night for his answer She paused and looked imploringly at Cecily Cecily did not speak She stood tall and unrelenting by the table The rigidity of her face and figure smote Lucy Ellen like a blow She threw out her bleached little hands and spoke with a sudden passion utterly foreign to her Cecily I want to marry him I I love him I always have I never thought of this when I promised Oh Cecily you ll let me off my promise won t you No said Cecily It was all she said Lucy Ellen s hands fell to her sides and the light went out of her face You won t she said hopelessly Cecily went out At the door she turned When John Edwards asked me to marry him six years ago I said no for your sake To my mind a promise is a promise But you were always weak and romantic Lucy Ellen Lucy Ellen made no response She stood limply on the hearth rug like a faded blossom bitten by frost After Cromwell Biron had gone away the next evening with all his brisk jauntiness shorn from him for the time Lucy Ellen went up to Cecily s room She stood for a moment in the narrow doorway with the lamplight striking upward with a gruesome effect on her wan face I ve sent him away she said lifelessly I ve kept my promise Cecily There was silence for a moment Cecily did not know what to say Suddenly Lucy Ellen burst out bitterly I wish I was dead Then she turned swiftly and ran across the hall to her own room Cecily gave a little moan of pain This was her reward for all the love she had lavished on Lucy Ellen Anyway it is all over she said looking dourly into the moonlit boughs of the firs Lucy Ellen ll get over it When Cromwell is gone she ll forget all about him I m not going to fret She promised and she wanted the promise first During the next fortnight tragedy held grim sway in the little weather gray house among the firs a tragedy tempered with grim comedy for Cecily who amid all her agony could not help being amused at Lucy Ellen s romantic way of sorrowing Lucy Ellen did her mornings work listlessly and drooped through the afternoons Cecily would have felt it as a relief if Lucy Ellen had upbraided her but after her outburst on the night she sent Cromwell away Lucy Ellen never uttered a word of reproach or complaint One evening Cecily made a neighborly call in the village Cromwell Biron happened to be there and gallantly insisted upon seeing her home She understood from Cromwell s unaltered manner that Lucy Ellen had not told him why she had refused him She felt a sudden admiration for her cousin When they reached the house Cromwell halted suddenly in the banner of light that streamed from the sitting room window They saw Lucy Ellen sitting alone before the fire her arms folded on the table and her head bowed on them Her white cat sat unnoticed at the table beside her Cecily gave a gasp of surrender You d better come in she said harshly Lucy Ellen looks lonesome Cromwell muttered sheepishly I m afraid I wouldn t be company for her Lucy Ellen doesn t like me much Oh doesn t she said Cecily bitterly She likes you better than she likes me for all I ve but it s no matter It s been all my fault she ll explain Tell her I said she could Come in I say She caught the still reluctant Cromwell by the arm and fairly dragged him over the geranium beds and through the front door She opened the sitting room door and pushed him in Lucy Ellen rose in amazement Over Cromwell s bald head loomed Cecily s dark face tragic and determined Here s your beau Lucy Ellen she said and I give you back your promise She shut the door upon the sudden illumination of Lucy Ellen s face and went up stairs with the tears rolling down her cheeks It s my turn to wish I was dead she muttered Then she laughed hysterically That goose of a Cromwell How queer he did look standing there frightened to death of Lucy Ellen Poor little Lucy Ellen Well I hope he ll be good to her The Pursuit of the Ideal Freda s snuggery was aglow with the rose red splendour of an open fire which was triumphantly warding off the stealthy approaches of the dull grey autumn twilight Roger saint Clair stretched himself out luxuriously in an easy chair with a sigh of pleasure Freda your armchairs are the most comfy in the world How do you get them to fit into a fellow s kinks so splendidly Freda smiled at him out of big owlish eyes that were the same tint as the coppery grey sea upon which the north window of the snuggery looked Any armchair will fit a lazy fellow s kinks she said I m not lazy protested Roger That you should say so Freda when I have wheeled all the way out of town this dismal afternoon over the worst bicycle road in three kingdoms to see you bonnie maid I like lazy people said Freda softly tilting her spoon on a cup of chocolate with a slender brown hand Roger smiled at her chummily You are such a comfortable girl he said I like to talk to you and tell you things You have something to tell me today It has been fairly sticking out of your eyes ever since you came Now fess Freda put away her cup and saucer got up and stood by the fireplace with one arm outstretched along the quaintly carved old mantel She laid her head down on its curve and looked expectantly at Roger I have seen my ideal Freda said Roger gravely Freda lifted her head and then laid it down again She did not speak Roger was glad of it Even at the moment he found himself thinking that Freda had a genius for silence Any other girl he knew would have broken in at once with surprised exclamations and questions and spoiled his story You have not forgotten what my ideal woman is like he said Freda shook her head She was not likely to forget She remembered only too keenly the afternoon he had told her They had been sitting in the snuggery herself in the inglenook and Roger coiled up in his big pet chair that nobody else ever sat in What must my lady be that I must love her he had quoted Well I will paint my dream love for you Freda She must be tall and slender with chestnut hair of wonderful gloss with just the suggestion of a ripple in it She must have an oval face colourless ivory in hue with the expression of a Madonna and her eyes must be passionless peaceful blue deep and tender as a twilight sky Freda looking at herself along her arm in the mirror recalled this description and smiled faintly She was short and plump with a piquant irregular little face vivid tinting curly unmanageable hair of ruddy brown and big grey eyes Certainly she was not his ideal When and where did you meet your lady of the Madonna face and twilight eyes she asked Roger frowned Freda s face was solemn enough but her eyes looked as if she might be laughing at him I haven t met her yet I have only seen her It was in the park yesterday She was in a carriage with the Mandersons So beautiful Freda Our eyes met as she drove past and I realized that I had found my long sought ideal I rushed back to town and hunted up Pete Manderson at the club Pete is a donkey but he has his ways of being useful He told me who she was Her name is Stephanie Gardiner she is his cousin from the south and is visiting his mother And Freda I am to dine at the Mandersons tonight I shall meet her Do goddesses and ideals and Madonnas eat said Freda in an awed whisper Her eyes were certainly laughing now Roger got up stiffly I must confess I did not expect that you would ridicule my confidence Freda he said frigidly It is very unlike you But if you are not interested I will not bore you with any further details And it is time I was getting back to town anyhow When he had gone Freda ran to the west window and flung it open She leaned out and waved both hands at him over the spruce hedge Roger Roger I was a horrid little beast Forget it immediately please And come out tomorrow and tell me all about her Roger came He bored Freda terribly with his raptures but she never betrayed it She was all sympathy or at least as much sympathy as a woman can be who must listen while the man of men sings another woman s praises to her She sent Roger away in perfect good humour with himself and all the world then she curled herself up in the snuggery pulled a rug over her head and cried Roger came out to Lowlands oftener than ever after that He had to talk to somebody about Stephanie Gardiner and Freda was the safest vent The pursuit of the Ideal as she called it went on with vim and fervour Sometimes Roger would be on the heights of hope and elation the next visit he would be in the depths of despair and humility Freda had learned to tell which it was by the way he opened the snuggery door One day when Roger came he found six feet of young man reposing at ease in his particular chair Freda was sipping chocolate in her corner and looking over the rim of her cup at the intruder just as she had been wont to look at Roger She had on a new dark red gown and looked vivid and rose hued She introduced the stranger as mister Grayson and called him Tim They seemed to be excellent friends Roger sat bolt upright on the edge of a fragile gilded chair which Freda kept to hide a shabby spot in the carpet and glared at Tim until the latter said goodbye and lounged out You ll be over tomorrow said Freda Can t I come this evening he pleaded Freda nodded Yes and we ll make taffy You used to make such delicious stuff Tim Who is that fellow Freda Roger inquired crossly as soon as the door closed Freda began to make a fresh pot of chocolate She smiled dreamily as if thinking of something pleasant Why that was Tim Grayson dear old Tim He used to live next door to us when we were children And we were such chums always together making mud pies and getting into scrapes He is just the same old Tim and is home from the west for a long visit I was so glad to see him again So it would appear said Roger grumpily Well now that dear old Tim is gone I suppose I can have my own chair can I And do give me some chocolate I didn t know you made taffy Oh I don t It s Tim He can do everything He used to make it long ago and I washed up after him and helped him eat it How is the pursuit of the Ideal coming on Roger boy Roger did not feel as if he wanted to talk about the Ideal He noticed how vivid Freda s smile was and how lovable were the curves of her neck where the dusky curls were caught up from it He had also an inner vision of Freda making taffy with Tim and he did not approve of it He refused to talk about the Ideal On his way back to town he found himself thinking that Freda had the most charming glad little laugh of any girl he knew He suddenly remembered that he had never heard the Ideal laugh She smiled placidly he had raved to Freda about that smile but she did not laugh Roger began to wonder what an ideal without any sense of humour would be like when translated into the real He went to Lowlands the next afternoon and found Tim there in his chair again He detested the fellow but he could not deny that he was good looking and had charming manners Freda was very nice to Tim On his way back to town Roger decided that Tim was in love with Freda He was furious at the idea The presumption of the man He also remembered that he had not said a word to Freda about the Ideal And he never did say much more perhaps because he could not get the chance Tim was always there before him and generally outstayed him One day when he went out he did not find Freda at home Her aunt told him that she was out riding with mister Grayson On his way back he met them As they cantered by Freda waved her riding whip at him Her face was full of warm ripe kissable tints her loose lovelocks were blowing about it and her eyes shone like grey pools mirroring stars Roger turned and watched them out of sight behind the firs that cupped Lowlands That night at missus Crandall s dinner table somebody began to talk about Freda Roger strained his ears to listen missus Kitty Carr was speaking missus Kitty knew everything and everybody She is simply the most charming girl in the world when you get really acquainted with her said missus Kitty with the air of having discovered and patented Freda She is so vivid and unconventional and lovable spirit and fire and dew you know Tim Grayson is a very lucky fellow Are they engaged someone asked Not yet I fancy But of course it is only a question of time Tim simply adores her He is a good soul and has lots of money so he ll do But really you know I think a prince wouldn t be good enough for Freda Roger suddenly became conscious that the Ideal was asking him a question of which he had not heard a word He apologized and was forgiven But he went home a very miserable man He did not go to Lowlands for two weeks They were the longest most wretched two weeks he had ever lived through One afternoon he heard that Tim Grayson had gone back west missus Kitty told it mournfully Of course this means that Freda has refused him she said She is such an odd girl Roger went straight out to Lowlands He found Freda in the snuggery and held out his hands to her Freda will you marry me It will take a lifetime to tell you how much I love you But the Ideal questioned Freda I have just discovered what my ideal is said Roger She is a dear loyal companionable little girl with the jolliest laugh and the warmest truest heart in the world She has starry grey eyes two dimples and a mouth I must and will kiss there there there Freda tell me you love me a little bit although I ve been such a besotted idiot I will not let you call my husband that is to be names said Freda snuggling down into the curve of his shoulder But indeed Roger boy you will have to make me very very happy to square matters up You have made me so unutterably unhappy for two months The pursuit of the Ideal is ended declared Roger The Softening of Miss Cynthia I wonder if I d better flavour this cake with lemon or vanilla It s the most perplexing thing I ever heard of in my life Miss Cynthia put down the bottles with a vexed frown her perplexity had nothing whatever to do with flavouring the golden mixture in her cake bowl missus John Joe knew that the latter had dropped in in a flurry of curiosity concerning the little boy whom she had seen about Miss Cynthia s place for the last two days Her daughter Kitty was with her they both sat close together on the kitchen sofa It is too bad said missus John Joe sympathetically I don t wonder you are mixed up So unexpected too When did he come Tuesday night said Miss Cynthia She had decided on the vanilla and was whipping it briskly in I saw an express wagon drive into the yard with a boy and a trunk in it and I went out just as he got down Are you my Aunt Cynthia he said Who in the world are you I asked And he says I m Wilbur Merrivale and my father was John Merrivale He died three weeks ago and he said I was to come to you because you were his sister Well you could just have knocked me down with a feather I m sure said missus John Joe But I didn t know you had a brother And his name Merrivale Well he wasn t any relation really I was about six years old when my father married his mother the Widow Merrivale John was just my age and we were brought up together just like brother and sister He was a real nice fellow I must say But he went out to Californy years ago and I haven t heard a word of him for fifteen years didn t know if he was alive or dead But it seems from what I can make out from the boy that his mother died when he was a baby and him and John roughed it along together pretty poor too I guess till John took a fever and died And he told some of his friends to send the boy to me for he d no relations there and not a cent in the world And the child came all the way from Californy and here he is I ve been just distracted ever since I ve never been used to children and to have the house kept in perpetual uproar is more than I can stand He s about twelve and a born mischief He ll tear through the rooms with his dirty feet and he s smashed one of my blue vases and torn down a curtain and set Towser on the cat half a dozen times already I never was so worried I ve got him out on the verandah shelling peas now to keep him quiet for a little spell I m really sorry for you said missus John Joe But poor child I suppose he s never had anyone to look after him And come all the way from Californy alone too he must be real smart Too smart I guess He must take after his mother whoever she was for there ain t a bit of Merrivale in him And he s been brought up pretty rough Well it ll be a great responsibility for you Cynthia of course But he ll be company too and he ll be real handy to run errands and I m not going to keep him said Miss Cynthia determinedly Her thin lips set themselves firmly and her voice had a hard ring Not going to keep him said missus John Joe blankly You can t send him back to Californy I don t intend to But as for having him here to worry my life out and keep me in a perpetual stew I just won t do it D ye think I m going to trouble myself about children at my age And all he d cost for clothes and schooling too I can t afford it I don t suppose his father expected it either I suppose he expected me to look after him a bit and of course I will A boy of his age ought to be able to earn his keep anyway If I look out a place for him somewhere where he can do odd jobs and go to school in the winter I think it s all anyone can expect of me when he ain t really no blood relation Miss Cynthia flung the last sentence at missus John Joe rather defiantly not liking the expression on that lady s face I suppose nobody could expect more Cynthy said missus John Joe deprecatingly He would be an awful bother I ve no doubt and you ve lived alone so long with no one to worry you that you wouldn t know what to do with him Boys are always getting into mischief my four just keep me on the dead jump Still it s a pity for him poor little fellow No mother or father it seems hard Miss Cynthia s face grew grimmer than ever as she went to the door with her callers and watched them down the garden path As soon as missus John Joe saw that the door was shut she unburdened her mind to her daughter Did you ever hear tell of the like I thought I knew Cynthia Henderson well if anybody in Wilmot did but this beats me Just think Kitty there she is no one knows how rich and not a soul in the world belonging to her and she won t even take in her brother s child She must be a hard woman But it s just meanness pure and simple she grudges him what he d eat and wear The poor mite doesn t look as if he d need much Cynthia didn t used to be like that but it s growing on her every day She s got hard as rocks That afternoon Miss Cynthia harnessed her fat grey pony into the phaeton herself she kept neither man nor maid but lived in her big immaculate house in solitary state and drove away down the dusty buttercup bordered road leaving Wilbur sitting on the verandah She returned in an hour s time and drove into the yard shutting the gate behind her with a vigorous snap Wilbur was not in sight and fearful lest he should be in mischief she hurriedly tied the pony to the railing and went in search of him She found him sitting by the well his chin in his hands he was pale and his eyes were red Miss Cynthia hardened her heart and took him into the house I ve been down to see mister Robins this afternoon Wilbur she said pretending to brush some invisible dust from the bottom of her nice black cashmere skirt for an excuse to avoid looking at him and he s agreed to take you on trial It s a real good chance better than you could expect He says he ll board and clothe you and let you go to school in the winter The boy seemed to shrink Daddy said that I would stay with you he said wistfully He said you were so good and kind and would love me for his sake For a moment Miss Cynthia softened She had been very fond of her stepbrother it seemed that his voice appealed to her across the grave in behalf of his child But the crust of years was not to be so easily broken Your father meant that I would look after you she said and I mean to but I can t afford to keep you here You ll have a good place at mister Robins if you behave yourself I m going to take you down now before I unharness the pony so go and wash your face while I put up your things Don t look so woebegone for pity s sake I m not taking you to prison Wilbur turned and went silently to the kitchen Miss Cynthia thought she heard a sob She went with a firm step into the little bedroom off the hall and took a purse out of a drawer I s pose I ought she said doubtfully I don t s pose he has a cent I daresay he ll lose or waste it She counted out seventy five cents carefully When she came out Wilbur was at the door She put the money awkwardly into his hand There see that you don t spend it on any foolishness Miss Cynthia s Action made a good deal of talk in Wilmot The women headed by missus John Joe who said behind Cynthia s back what she did not dare say to her face condemned her The men laughed and said that Cynthia was a shrewd one there was no getting round her Miss Cynthia herself was far from easy She could not forget Wilbur s wistful eyes and she had heard that Robins was a hard master A week after the boy had gone she saw him one day at the store He was lifting heavy bags from a cart The work was beyond his strength and he was flushed and panting Miss Cynthia s conscience gave her a hard stab She bought a roll of peppermints and took them over to him He thanked her timidly and drove quickly away Robins hasn t any business putting such work on a child she said to herself indignantly I ll speak to him about it And she did and got an answer that made her ears tingle mister Robins bluntly told her he guessed he knew what was what about his hands He weren t no nigger driver If she wasn t satisfied she might take the boy away as soon as she liked Miss Cynthia did not get much comfort out of life that summer Almost everywhere she went she was sure to meet Wilbur engaged in some hard task She could not help seeing how miserably pale and thin he had become The worry had its effect on her The neighbours said that Cynthy was sharper than ever Even her church going was embittered She had always enjoyed walking up the aisle with her rich silk skirt rustling over the carpet her cashmere shawl folded correctly over her shoulders and her lace bonnet set precisely on her thin shining crimps But she could take no pleasure in that or in the sermon now when Wilbur sat right across from her pew between hard featured Robins and his sulky looking wife The boy s eyes had grown too large for his thin face The softening of Miss Cynthia was a very gradual process but it reached a climax one September morning when missus John Joe came into the former s kitchen with an important face Miss Cynthia was preserving her plums No thank you I ll not sit down I only run in I suppose you ve heard it That little Merrivale boy has took awful sick with fever they say He s been worked half to death this summer everyone knows what Robins is with his help and they say he has fretted a good deal for his father and been homesick and he s run down I s pose Anyway Robins took him over to the hospital at Stanford last night good gracious Cynthy are you sick Miss Cynthia had staggered to a seat by the table her face was pallid No it s only your news gave me a turn it came so suddenly I didn t know I must hurry back and see to the men s dinners I thought I d come and tell you though I didn t know as you d care This parting shot was unheeded by Miss Cynthia She laid her face in her hands It s a judgement on me she moaned He s going to die and I m his murderess This is the account I ll have to give John Merrivale of his boy I ve been a wicked selfish woman and I m justly punished It was a humbled Miss Cynthia who met the doctor at the hospital that afternoon He shook his head at her eager questions It s a pretty bad case The boy seems run down every way No it is impossible to think of moving him again Bringing him here last night did him a great deal of harm Yes you may see him but he will not know you I fear he is delirious and raves of his father and California Miss Cynthia followed the doctor down the long ward When he paused by a cot she pushed past him Wilbur lay tossing restlessly on his pillow He was thin to emaciation but his cheeks were crimson and his eyes burning bright Miss Cynthia stooped and took the hot dry hands in hers Wilbur she sobbed don t you know me Aunt Cynthia You are not my Aunt Cynthia said Wilbur Daddy said Aunt Cynthia was good and kind you are a cross bad woman I want Daddy Why doesn t he come Why doesn t he come to little Wilbur Miss Cynthia got up and faced the doctor He s got to get better she said stubbornly Spare no expense or trouble If he dies I will be a murderess He must live and give me a chance to make it up for him And he did live but for a long time it was a hard fight and there were days when it seemed that death must win Miss Cynthia got so thin and wan that even missus John Joe pitied her The earth seemed to Miss Cynthia to laugh out in prodigal joyousness on the afternoon she drove home when Wilbur had been pronounced out of danger How tranquil the hills looked with warm October sunshine sleeping on their sides and faint blue hazes on their brows How gallantly the maples flaunted their crimson flags How kind and friendly was every face she met Afterwards Miss Cynthia said she began to live that day Wilbur s recovery was slow Every day Miss Cynthia drove over with some dainty and her loving gentleness sat none the less gracefully on her because of its newness Wilbur grew to look for and welcome her coming When it was thought safe to remove him Miss Cynthia went to the hospital with a phaeton load of shawls and pillows I have come to take you away she said Wilbur shrank back Not to mister Robins he said piteously Oh not there Aunt Cynthia Of course not Miss Cynthia said Them Notorious Pigs John Harrington was a woman hater or thought that he was which amounts to the same thing He was forty five and having been handsome in his youth was a fine looking man still He had a remarkably good farm and was a remarkably good farmer He also had a garden which was the pride and delight of his heart or at least it was before missus Hayden s pigs got into it Sarah King Harrington s aunt and housekeeper was deaf and crabbed and very few visitors ever came to the house This suited Harrington He was a good citizen and did his duty by the community but his bump of sociability was undeveloped He was also a contented man looking after his farm improving his stock and experimenting with new bulbs in undisturbed serenity This however was all too good to last A man is bound to have some troubles in this life and Harrington s were near their beginning when Perry Hayden bought the adjoining farm from the heirs of Shakespeare Ely deceased and moved in To be sure Perry Hayden poor fellow did not bother Harrington much for he died of pneumonia a month after he came there but his widow carried on the farm with the assistance of a lank hired boy Her own children Charles and Theodore commonly known as Bobbles and Ted were as yet little more than babies The real trouble began when Mary Hayden s pigs fourteen in number and of half grown voracity got into Harrington s garden A railing a fir grove and an apple orchard separated the two establishments but these failed to keep the pigs within bounds Harrington had just got his garden planted for the season and to go out one morning and find a horde of enterprising porkers rooting about in it was to put it mildly trying He was angry but as it was a first offence he drove the pigs out with tolerable calmness mended the fence and spent the rest of the day repairing damages Three days later the pigs got in again Harrington relieved his mind by some scathing reflections on women who tried to run farms Then he sent Mordecai his hired man over to the Hayden place to ask missus Hayden if she would be kind enough to keep her pigs out of his garden missus Hayden sent back word that she was very sorry and would not let it occur again Nobody not even John Harrington could doubt that she meant what she said But she had reckoned without the pigs They had not forgotten the flavour of Egyptian fleshpots as represented by the succulent young shoots in the Harrington domains A week later Mordecai came in and told Harrington that them notorious pigs were in his garden again There is a limit to everyone s patience Harrington left Mordecai to drive them out while he put on his hat and stalked over to the Haydens place Ted and Bobbles were playing at marbles in the lane and ran when they saw him coming He got close up to the little low house among the apple trees before Mordecai appeared in the yard driving the pigs around the barn missus Hayden was sitting on her doorstep paring her dinner potatoes and stood up hastily when she saw her visitor Harrington had never seen his neighbour at close quarters before Now he could not help seeing that she was a very pretty little woman with wistful dark blue eyes and an appealing expression Mary Hayden had been next to a beauty in her girlhood and she had a good deal of her bloom left yet although hard work and worry were doing their best to rob her of it But John Harrington was an angry man and did not care whether the woman in question was pretty or not Her pigs had rooted up his garden that fact filled his mind missus Hayden those pigs of yours have been in my garden again I simply can t put up with this any longer Why in the name of reason don t you look after your animals better If I find them in again I ll set my dog on them I give you fair warning A faint colour had crept into Mary Hayden s soft milky white cheeks during this tirade and her voice trembled as she said I m very sorry mister Harrington I suppose Bobbles forgot to shut the gate of their pen again this morning He is so forgetful I d lengthen his memory then if I were you returned Harrington grimly supposing that Bobbles was the hired man I m not going to have my garden ruined just because he happens to be forgetful I am speaking my mind plainly madam If you can t keep your stock from being a nuisance to other people you ought not to try to run a farm at all Then did missus Hayden sit down upon the doorstep and burst into tears Harrington felt as Sarah King would have expressed it every which way at once Here was a nice mess What a nuisance women were worse than the pigs Oh don t cry missus Hayden he said awkwardly I didn t mean well I suppose I spoke too strongly Of course I know you didn t mean to let the pigs in There do stop crying I beg your pardon if I ve hurt your feelings Oh it isn t that sobbed missus Hayden wiping away her tears It s only I ve tried so hard and everything seems to go wrong I make such mistakes As for your garden sir I ll pay for the damage my pigs have done if you ll let me know what it comes to She sobbed again and caught her breath like a grieved child Harrington felt like a brute He had a queer notion that if he put his arm around her and told her not to worry over things women were not created to attend to he would be expressing his feelings better than in any other way But of course he couldn t do that Instead he muttered that the damage didn t amount to much after all and he hoped she wouldn t mind what he said and then he got himself away and strode through the orchard like a man in a desperate hurry Mordecai had gone home and the pigs were not to be seen but a chubby little face peeped at him from between two scrub bloom white cherry trees G way you bad man said Bobbles vindictively G way You made my mommer cry I saw you I m only Bobbles now but when I grow up I ll be Charles Henry Hayden and you won t dare to make my mommer cry then Harrington smiled grimly So you re the lad who forgets to shut the pigpen gate are you Come out here and let me see you Who is in there with you Ted is He s littler than me But I won t come out I don t like you G way home Harrington obeyed He went home and to work in his garden But work as hard as he would he could not forget Mary Hayden s grieved face I was a brute he thought Why couldn t I have mentioned the matter gently I daresay she has enough to trouble her Confound those pigs After that there was a time of calm Evidently something had been done to Bobbles memory or perhaps missus Hayden attended to the gate herself At all events the pigs were not seen and Harrington s garden blossomed like the rose But Harrington himself was in a bad state For one thing wherever he looked he saw the mental picture of his neighbour s tired sweet face and the tears in her blue eyes The original he never saw which only made matters worse He wondered what opinion she had of him and decided that she must think him a cross old bear This worried him He wished the pigs would break in again so that he might have a chance to show how forbearing he could be One day he gathered a nice mess of tender young greens and sent them over to missus Hayden by Mordecai At first he had thought of sending her some flowers but that seemed silly and besides Mordecai and flowers were incongruous missus Hayden sent back a very pretty message of thanks whereat Harrington looked radiant and Mordecai who could see through a stone wall as well as most people went out to the barn and chuckled Ef the little widder hain t caught him Who d a thought it The next day one adventurous pig found its way alone into the Harrington garden Harrington saw it get in and at the same moment he saw missus Hayden running through her orchard She was in his yard by the time he got out Her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead Her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish Oh mister Harrington she said breathlessly that pet pig of Bobbles is in your garden again He only got in this minute I saw him coming and I ran right after him He s there all right said Harrington cheerfully but I ll get him out in a jiffy Don t tire yourself Won t you go into the house and rest while I drive him around missus Hayden however was determined to help and they both went around to the garden set the gate open and tried to drive the pig out But Harrington was not thinking about pigs and missus Hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as Mordecai did as a consequence they did not make much headway In her excitement missus Hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way and Harrington in order to keep near her ran after her Between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done But at last the pig grew tired of the fun bolted out of the gate and ran across the yard to his own place missus Hayden followed slowly and Harrington walked beside her Those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow she said Hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last Oh I wouldn t said Harrington hastily It isn t good for pigs to be shut up so young You d better let them run a while yet No said missus Hayden decidedly They have almost worried me to death already In they go tomorrow They were at the lane gate now and Harrington had to open it and let her pass through He felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay Bobbles and Ted came running to meet her and the three hand in hand disappeared from sight Harrington went back to the house feeling that life was flat stale and unprofitable That evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King with Bobbles and Ted on either hand Then he found out what was the matter with him He was in love fathoms deep with the blue eyed widow Presumably the pigs were shut up the next day for Harrington s garden was invaded no more He stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion He filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the Hayden place boldly enough to all appearance but with his heart thumping like any schoolboy s The front door stood hospitably open flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks Harrington paused on the step with his hand outstretched to knock Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing Forgetting all about knocking he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting room Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him He was looking at Mary Hayden who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion Harrington put down his strawberries Mary he exclaimed missus Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears What is the matter said Harrington anxiously Is anything wrong Oh nothing much Said missus Hayden trying to recover herself Yes there is too But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this I didn t know anyone was near And I was feeling so discouraged The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him It was Ted s colt But there there is no use in crying over it And by way of proving this the poor tired overburdened little woman began to cry again She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not The woman hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley Don t cry Mary Listen to me You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry You ought to be looked after and petted I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right I ve loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry Do you think you can like me a little Mary It may be that missus Hayden was not very much surprised because Harrington s face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together As for what she said perhaps Bobbles who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington s strawberries may tell you but I certainly shall not The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history Sarah King has gone also and missus John Harrington reigns royally in her place Bobbles and Ted have a small blue eyed much spoiled sister and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age but will never meet his doom otherwise It is Bobbles pig and one of the famous fourteen Mordecai still shambles around and worships missus Harrington The garden is the same as of yore but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle It was them notorious pigs as did it all Why Not Ask Miss Price Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother who was making mincemeat Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask What is the matter You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news Fan So it does It is from Aunt Clara to say she cannot come She has received a telegram that her sister in law is very ill and she must go to her at once missus Allen looked regretful and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air That is too bad I feel as if our celebration were spoiled But I suppose it can t be helped No agreed Frances sitting down and beginning to peel apples So there is no use in lamenting or I would certainly sit down and cry I feel so disappointed Is Uncle Frank coming Yes Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if missus King does not get worse So that will leave just one vacant place We must invite someone to fill it up Who shall it be Both girls looked rather puzzled missus Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself they had made no change in the usual list of guests It must just be the time honoured family affair Frances had declared If we begin inviting other folks there is no knowing when to draw the line We can t have more than fourteen and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted So the same old list it was But now Aunt Clara dear jolly Aunt Clara whom everybody in the connection loved and admired could not come and her place must be filled We can t invite the new minister because we would have to have his sister too said Frances And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another Mother you will have to help us out said Alma Can t you suggest a substitute guest missus Allen looked down at the two bright girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly I think I can but I am not sure my choice will please you Why not ask Miss Price Miss Price They had never thought of her She was the pale timid looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school Miss Price repeated Frances slowly Why Mother we hardly know her She is dreadfully dull and quiet I think And so shy said Alma Why at the Wards party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving She is a very lonely little creature said missus Allen gently and doesn t seem to have anyone belonging to her I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding house where she lives Of course if you would like to have her Mother we will ask her said Frances No girls said missus Allen seriously You must not ask Miss Price on my account if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely hard working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one But there I shall not preach This is your dinner and you must please yourselves as to your guests Frances and Alma had both flushed and they now remained silent for a few minutes Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother You re right Mother dear as you always are and we are very selfish girls We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time I ll go down this very evening and see her In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding house her pale little face paler and her grey eyes sadder than ever in the fading light Only two days until Thanksgiving but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her Why she asked herself rebelliously when there seemed so much love in the world was she denied her share Her landlady met her in the hall Miss Allen is in the parlour Miss Price She wants to see you Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome vivacious girl who was so different from herself I am sorry you have had to wait Miss Allen she said shyly I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected My errand won t take very long said Frances brightly Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us Miss Price if you have no other engagement We will have a few other guests but nobody outside our own family except mister Seeley who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town You ll come won t you Oh thank you yes said Bertha in pleased surprise I shall be very glad to go Why it is so nice to think of it I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad not a bit Thanksgivingy We shall expect you then said Frances with a cordial little hand squeeze Come early in the morning and we will have a real friendly pleasant day That night Frances said to her mother and sister You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price s when I asked her up She looked positively pretty such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars She reminded me so much of somebody I ve seen but I can t think who it is I m so glad we ve asked her here for Thanksgiving Thanksgiving came as bright and beautiful as a day could be and the Allens guests came with it Bertha Price was among them paler and shyer than ever Ernest Allen and his friend Maxwell Seeley came out from town on the morning train After all the necessary introductions had been made Frances flew to the kitchen I ve found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of she said as she bustled about the range It s Max Seeley You needn t laugh Al It s a fact I noticed it the minute I introduced them He s plump and prosperous and she s pinched and pale but there s a resemblance nevertheless Look for yourself and see if it isn t so Back in the big cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters the uncles and cousins and aunts were all chattering to each other and mister Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed You will excuse me won t you Miss Price if I ask you something about yourself he said eagerly The truth is you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her I do not think I have any relatives of your name Have you any of mine Bertha flushed hesitated for an instant then said frankly No I do not think so But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is although I think it begins with S I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old and I was then taken to an orphan asylum The next year I was taken from there and adopted by missus Price She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter I had a happy home with her although we were poor missus Price wished me to bear her name and I did so She never told me my true surname perhaps she did not know it She died when I was sixteen and since then I have been quite alone in the world That is all I know about myself Max Seeley was plainly excited Why do you think your real name begins with S he asked I have a watch which belonged to my mother with the monogram B S on the case It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to missus Price for me Here it is Max Seeley almost snatched the old fashioned little silver watch from her hand and opened the case An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side They looked like the initials M A S Let me tell my story now he said My name is Maxwell Seeley My father died when I was seven years old and my mother a year later My little sister Bertha then three years old and I were left quite alone and very poor We had no relatives I was adopted by a well to do old bachelor who had known my father My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education I did not forget my sister and as soon as I could I went to the asylum I found that she had been taken away long before and I could not even discover who had adopted her for the original building with all its records had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit I never could find any clue to her whereabouts and long since gave up all hope of finding her But I have found her at last You are Bertha Seeley my little sister Oh can it be possible More than possible it is certain You are the image of my mother as I remember her and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her And this is her watch see I scratched my own initials on the case one day There is no doubt in the world Oh Bertha are you half as glad as I am Glad Bertha s eyes were shining like stars She tried to smile but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother s shoulder By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau and Ernest coming through the hall gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings I haven t suddenly gone crazy Ernest old fellow smiled Max Ladies and gentlemen all this little school ma am was introduced to you as Miss Price but that was a mistake Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley my long lost and newly found sister Well they had an amazing time then of course They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone cold on the dining room table Luckily Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time and they all got out somehow and into their places It was a splendid dinner but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley didn t know what they were eating any more than if it had been sawdust However the rest of the guests made up for that and did full justice to the girls cookery In the afternoon they all went to church and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day When the dusk came Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town and the other guests went home with the exception of Bertha who was to stay all night Just as soon as her resignation could be effected she was to join her brother Meanwhile I ll see about getting a house to put you in said Max No more boarding out for me Ernest You may consider me as a family man henceforth Frances and Alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night Just think said Frances if we hadn t asked her here today she might never have found her brother It s all Mother s doing bless her Things do happen like a storybook sometimes don t they Al And didn t I
