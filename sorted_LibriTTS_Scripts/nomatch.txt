26_495_000028_000000	Besides this it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate 
26_495_000029_000001	The last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows 
26_495_000034_000001	It was however upon inquiry found that this Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who having lived in Long Acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected 
26_495_000035_000000	This was the beginning of May yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes 
26_495_000035_000003	The whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but three hundred forty seven and the week above mentioned but three hundred forty three 
26_495_000035_000005	So that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement 
26_495_000036_000000	The next bill was from the twenty third of May to the thirtieth when the number of the plague was seventeen 
26_495_000039_000000	Till this week the city continued free there having never any died except that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before within the whole ninety seven parishes 
26_495_000041_000000	This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see and as it was a sight which I could not but look on from morning to night for indeed there was nothing else of moment to be seen it filled me with very serious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city and the unhappy condition of those that would be left in it 
26_495_000046_000000	The first consideration was of great moment to me my trade was a saddler and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America so my effects lay very much in the hands of such 
26_495_000049_000001	Once I resolved to travel on foot with one servant and as many did lie at no inn but carry a soldier s tent with us and so lie in the fields the weather being very warm and no danger from taking cold 
26_495_000052_000000	It came very warmly into my mind one morning as I was musing on this particular thing that as nothing attended us without the direction or permission of Divine Power so these disappointments must have something in them extraordinary and I ought to consider whether it did not evidently point out or intimate to me that it was the will of Heaven I should not go 
26_495_000053_000000	These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again and when I came to discourse with my brother again I told him that I inclined to stay and take my lot in that station in which God had placed me and that it seemed to be made more especially my duty on the account of what I have said 
26_495_000056_000001	I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next day and I would resolve and as I had already prepared everything as well as I could as to MY business and whom to entrust my affairs with I had little to do but to resolve 
26_495_000057_000000	I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind irresolute and not knowing what to do 
26_495_000057_000001	I had set the evening wholly apart to consider seriously about it and was all alone for already people had as it were by a general consent taken up the custom of not going out of doors after sunset the reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by and by 
26_495_000059_000000	This lay close to me and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to stay than ever and supported with a secret satisfaction that I should be kept 
26_495_000059_000002	Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence 
26_495_000059_000004	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday 
26_495_000062_000001	The apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my illness and I went about my business as usual 
26_496_000004_000000	But the city itself began now to be visited too I mean within the walls but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a multitude having been gone into the country and even all this month of July they continued to flee though not in such multitudes as formerly 
26_496_000008_000000	One day being at that part of the town on some special business curiosity led me to observe things more than usually and indeed I walked a great way where I had no business 
26_496_000010_000002	It is true a vast many people fled as I have observed yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town and from that we call the heart of the city that is to say among the wealthiest of the people and such people as were unencumbered with trades and business 
26_496_000011_000001	All the old soldiers set up trades here and abundance of families settled here 
26_496_000012_000000	I often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when the Jews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover by which means an incredible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise have been in other countries so the plague entered London when an incredible increase of people had happened occasionally by the particular circumstances above named 
26_496_000012_000001	As this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay Court made a great trade in the city especially in everything that belonged to fashion and finery so it drew by consequence a great number of workmen manufacturers and the like being mostly poor people who depended upon their labour 
26_496_000013_000000	By this however the number of people in the whole may be judged of and indeed I often wondered that after the prodigious numbers of people that went away at first there was yet so great a multitude left as it appeared there was 
26_496_000015_000000	In the first place a blazing star or comet appeared for several months before the plague as there did the year after another a little before the fire 
26_496_000019_000003	Another ran about naked except a pair of drawers about his waist crying day and night like a man that Josephus mentions who cried Woe to Jerusalem a little before the destruction of that city 
26_496_000019_000004	So this poor naked creature cried Oh the great and the dreadful God and said no more but repeated those words continually with a voice and countenance full of horror a swift pace and nobody could ever find him to stop or rest or take any sustenance at least that ever I could hear of 
26_496_000019_000005	I met this poor creature several times in the streets and would have spoken to him but he would not enter into speech with me or any one else but held on his dismal cries continually 
26_496_000021_000000	Next to these public things were the dreams of old women or I should say the interpretation of old women upon other people s dreams and these put abundance of people even out of their wits 
26_496_000021_000001	Some heard voices warning them to be gone for that there would be such a plague in London so that the living would not be able to bury the dead 
26_496_000021_000003	And no wonder if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures representations and appearances which had nothing in them but air and vapour 
26_496_000021_000004	Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming out of a cloud with a point hanging directly over the city there they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried and there again heaps of dead bodies lying unburied and the like just as the imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon 
26_496_000021_000005	So hypochondriac fancies represent Ships armies battles in the firmament Till steady eyes the exhalations solve And all to its first matter cloud resolve 
26_496_000022_000000	I could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave every day of what they had seen and every one was so positive of their having seen what they pretended to see that there was no contradicting them without breach of friendship or being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one hand and profane and impenetrable on the other 
26_496_000022_000002	She described every part of the figure to the life showed them the motion and the form and the poor people came into it so eagerly and with so much readiness Yes I see it all plainly says one there s the sword as plain as can be Another saw the angel 
26_496_000022_000003	One saw his very face and cried out what a glorious creature he was 
26_496_000022_000004	One saw one thing and one another 
26_496_000022_000005	I looked as earnestly as the rest but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed upon and I said indeed that I could see nothing but a white cloud bright on one side by the shining of the sun upon the other part 
26_496_000022_000007	But the woman turning upon me looked in my face and fancied I laughed in which her imagination deceived her too for I really did not laugh but was very seriously reflecting how the poor people were terrified by the force of their own imagination 
26_496_000022_000008	However she turned from me called me profane fellow and a scoffer told me that it was a time of God s anger and dreadful judgements were approaching and that despisers such as I should wander and perish 
26_496_000023_000000	The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she and I found there was no persuading them that I did not laugh at them and that I should be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them 
26_496_000023_000001	So I left them and this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself 
26_496_000024_000000	Another encounter I had in the open day also and this was in going through a narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate Churchyard by a row of alms houses 
26_496_000025_000001	He described the shape the posture and the movement of it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of amazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as he 
26_496_000026_000000	I looked earnestly every way and at the very moment that this man directed but could not see the least appearance of anything but so positive was this poor man that he gave the people the vapours in abundance and sent them away trembling and frighted till at length few people that knew of it cared to go through that passage and hardly anybody by night on any account whatever 
26_496_000028_000000	These things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with delusions and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation all their predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague which should lay the whole city and even the kingdom waste and should destroy almost all the nation both man and beast 
26_496_000029_000000	To this as I said before the astrologers added stories of the conjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous influence one of which conjunctions was to happen and did happen in October and the other in November and they filled the people s heads with predictions on these signs of the heavens intimating that those conjunctions foretold drought famine and pestilence 
26_496_000029_000001	In the two first of them however they were entirely mistaken for we had no droughty season but in the beginning of the year a hard frost which lasted from December almost to March and after that moderate weather rather warm than hot with refreshing winds and in short very seasonable weather and also several very great rains 
26_496_000030_000000	Some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as terrified the people and to frighten the dispersers of them some of whom were taken up but nothing was done in it as I am informed the Government being unwilling to exasperate the people who were as I may say all out of their wits already

5808_48608_000005_000000	She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ibrahim son of Al Mahdi continued Now when the housemaster heard my name he sprang to his feet and said Indeed I wondered that such gifts should belong to any but the like of thee and Fortune hath done me a good turn for which I cannot thank her too much 
5808_48608_000005_000001	But haply this is a dream for how could I hope that one of the Caliphate house should visit my humble home and carouse with me this night I conjured him to be seated so he sat down and began to question me as to the cause of my visit in the most courteous terms 
5808_48608_000005_000003	Begin with the sister and he answered With joy and goodwill So she came down and he showed me her hand and behold she was the owner of the hand and wrist

5808_48608_000008_000000	When it was Three Hundred and Forty eighth Night
5808_48608_000009_000002	Now this was the woman who had given two scones as an alms to the asker and whose hands had been cut off therefor and when the King married her her fellow wives envied her and wrote to the common husband that she was an unchaste having just given birth to the boy so he wrote to his mother bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her there 
5808_48608_000009_000003	The old Queen obeyed his commandment and abandoned the woman and her son in the desert whereupon she fell to weeping for that which had befallen her and wailing with exceeding sore wail 
5808_48608_000009_000004	As she went along she came to a river and knelt down to drink being overcome with excess of thirst for fatigue of walking and for grief but as she bent her head the child which was at her neck fell into the water

5808_48608_000017_000004	Answered he O my lord it is yet but the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to rest I returned to my bed but sleep was forbidden to me and I ceased not to awaken the boy and he to put me off till break of day when he saddled me the mule and I mounted and rode out not knowing whither to go

1614-141486-0001	EIGHTEEN O FIVE GENERAL MEMORANDUM SENT TO THE COMMANDERS OF SHIPS THINKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING A FLEET OF FORTY SAIL OF THE LINE INTO A LINE OF BATTLE IN VARIABLE WINDS THICK WEATHER
1614-141486-0002	AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MUST OCCUR
1614-141486-0003	I HAVE THEREFORE MADE UP MY MIND TO KEEP THE FLEET IN THAT POSITION OF SAILING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND IN COMMAND
1614-141486-0004	PLACING THE FLEET IN TWO LINES OF SIXTEEN SHIPS EACH WITH AN ADVANCED SQUADRON OF EIGHT OF THE FASTEST SAILING TWO DECKED SHIPS WHICH WILL ALWAYS MAKE IF WANTED A LINE OF TWENTY FOUR SAIL ON WHICHEVER LINE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF MAY DIRECT
1614-141486-0005	THE SECOND IN COMMAND WILL AFTER MY INTENTIONS ARE MADE KNOWN TO HIM HAVE THE ENTIRE DIRECTION OF HIS LINE TO MAKE THE ATTACK UPON THE ENEMY AND TO FOLLOW UP THE BLOW UNTIL THEY ARE CAPTURED OR DESTROYED
1614-141486-0006	IF THE ENEMY S FLEET SHOULD BE SEEN TO WINDWARD IN LINE OF BATTLE AND THAT THE TWO LINES AND ADVANCED SQUADRON COULD FETCH THEM THEY WILL PROBABLY BE SO EXTENDED THAT THEIR VAN COULD NOT SUCCOUR THEIR REAR
1614-141486-0007	TO LEAD THROUGH ABOUT THEIR TWELFTH SHIP FROM THEIR REAR OR WHEREVER HE COULD FETCH IF NOT ABLE TO GET SO FAR ADVANCED MY LINE WOULD LEAD THROUGH ABOUT THEIR CENTRE AND THE ADVANCED SQUADRON TO CUT THREE OR FOUR SHIPS AHEAD OF THEIR CENTRE
1614-141486-0008	SO AS TO ENSURE GETTING AT THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON WHOM EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO CAPTURE THE WHOLE IMPRESSION OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST BE TO OVERPOWER FROM TWO OR THREE SHIPS AHEAD OF THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE CENTRE
1614-141486-0009	TO THE REAR OF THEIR FLEET I WILL SUPPOSE TWENTY SAIL OF THE ENEMY S LINE TO BE UNTOUCHED IT MUST BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY COULD PERFORM A MANOEUVRE TO BRING THEIR FORCE COMPACT TO ATTACK ANY PART OF THE BRITISH FLEET ENGAGED
1614-141486-0010	OR TO SUCCOUR THEIR OWN SHIPS WHICH INDEED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT MIXING WITH THE SHIPS ENGAGED THE ENEMY S FLEET IS SUPPOSED TO CONSIST OF FORTY SIX SAIL OF THE LINE
1614-141486-0011	BRITISH TO BE ONE FOURTH SUPERIOR TO THE ENEMY CUT OFF SOMETHING MUST BE LEFT TO CHANCE NOTHING IS SURE IN A SEA FIGHT BEYOND ALL OTHERS SHOT WILL CARRY AWAY MASTS AND YARDS OF FRIENDS AS WELL AS FOES
1614-141486-0012	BUT I LOOK WITH CONFIDENCE TO A VICTORY BEFORE THE VAN OF THE ENEMY COULD SUCCOUR THEIR REAR AND THEN THAT THE BRITISH FLEET WOULD MOST OF THEM BE READY TO RECEIVE THEIR TWENTY SAIL OF THE LINE OR TO PURSUE THEM SHOULD THEY ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE OFF IF THE VAN OF THE ENEMY TACK
1614-141486-0013	THE CAPTURED SHIPS MUST RUN TO LEEWARD OF THE BRITISH FLEET IF THE ENEMY WEAR THE BRITISH MUST PLACE THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND CAPTURED AND DISABLED BRITISH SHIPS AND SHOULD THE ENEMY CLOSE I HAVE NO FEAR FOR THE RESULT
