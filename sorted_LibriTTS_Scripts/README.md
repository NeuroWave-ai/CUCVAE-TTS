# The sorted LibriTTS scripts
The sorted LibriTTS scripts are part of work in the paper **Cross-Utterance Conditioned VAE for Non-Autoregressive Text-to-Speech**.
We re-process the scripts of LibriTTS dataset in the order of content.

nomatch.txt contains all the audio clips, which we cannot find in the original book by our code.

All sorted scripts are included in results/.
